While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models: (1) most existing approaches solely capture spatial correlations among neighbors on predefined graph structure, and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete graph connections; and (2) existing methods are defective to capture the temporal trends because the recurrent and stacking structure employed in these methods suffers from the long-range temporal dependency vanquish problem. To overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the dynamic spatialoral dependencies of traffic flows, we propose a new traffic speed prediction framework for multiscale graph attention networks (MS-GATNs). In particular, MS-GATNs is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture that learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multiheads attention mechanism is introduced to empower our model with the capability of capturing complex nonstationary temporal dynamics. Experiments on real-world traffic data sets demonstrate that MS-GATNs outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in long-term forecasting. \u00a9 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Year":2021,"Source title":"Journal of Transportation Engineering Part A: Systems","Authors":"Wu X., Fang J., Liu Z., Wu X.","DOI":"10.1061\/JTEPBS.0000600","Document Type":"Article","x":5.0709686279,"y":5.5018501282},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":38,"Cited by":null,"Title":"A Support Vector Machine Implementation for Traffic Assignment Problem","Author Keywords":"omnet++; sumo; svm; traci; vanet; veins","Abstract":"Simulating urban mobility scenarios is a useful tool for researchers in multiple fields like Urban Planning, Traffic Optimization, CO$^2$ Emissions Analysis, Performance Evaluation of Protocols for Connected Vehicles, among others.

Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of heat exposure is a critical factor in directing mitigation measures. Current heat vulnerability indices provide insight into heat sensitivities within given communities but do not account for the dynamic nature of the human movement as people travel for different activities. Here, we present a new Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure index (DTEx) that captures the varying heat exposure within urban environments. Methods: We developed the DTEx to understand human heat exposure patterns in a mid-sized city. This index incorporates the human movement pattern and the heat hazard pattern obtained via novel and advanced techniques. We generated the human movement pattern from large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data. The heat hazard patterns were extrapolated via machine learning models from air temperature data measured through vehicle-mounted sensors. The exposure index was then developed by combining the two parameters using their standard-deviation-classified indices. Results: Our exposure index varied between 2 and 12, indicating low to high thermal exposures. Several high-temperature spots associated with a large volume of foot traffic are successfully identified through this DTEx. We observed the hottest spots at shopping plazas but not specifically in the urban center. During the selected football gameday, the exposure index surged across most places near the football stadium but was reduced considerably further away. Discussion: The proposed DTEx is novel because it provides dynamic heat monitoring capability to facilitate heat mitigation strategies at vulnerable locations in urban environments. Combining the mobility data and extensive sensor data generates rich details on the most heat-exposed areas due to human congregation. Such information will be critical for risk communication and urban planning for policymakers. DTEx could also help smart route planning in sustainable cities to avoid heat hazards risks. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Year":2021,"Source title":"Environment International","Authors":"Yin Y., Grundstein A., Mishra D.R., Ramaswamy L., Hashemi Tonekaboni N., Dowd J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.envint.2021.106573","Document Type":"Article","x":5.2024421692,"y":4.6584434509},{"Cluster":2,"DocId":63,"Cited by":null,"Title":"A Traffic Accident Risk Prediction Model Based on Spatial Gated Memory Network","Author Keywords":"deep learning; risk prediction; traffic accident prediction; zero expansion problem","Abstract":"The prediction of traffic accidents is becoming more and more important in the field of public safety, especially in travel route planning and road safety deployment.

Therefore, based on the hybrid architecture of Quantum Annealing (QA) and brain-inspired cognitive computing, this study proposes QA and Brain-Inspired Clustering Algorithm (QABICA) to solve the problem of urban taxi-stand locations. Based on the traffic trajectory data of Xi'an and Chengdu provided by Didi Chuxing, the clustering results of our algorithm and K-means algorithm are compared. We find that the average taxi-stand location bias of the final result based on QABICA is smaller than that based on K-means, and the bias of our algorithm can effectively reduce the tradition K-means bias by approximately 42%, up to approximately 83%, with higher robustness.

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources.

While previous studies have utilized trajectories for this type of analysis at the level of a single geographical area, the results cannot be easily generalized to inform comparative analysis of different geographical areas.

However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geocontextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. To enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation, a multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions, forcing the embeddings to encapsulate effective representation for flow prediction.

This research has benefited urban planning, logistics, animal migration understanding, and much more. Typically, the movement is captured as precise geographic coordinates and time stamps with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Although some research uses computational techniques to take advantage of implicit movement in descriptions of route directions, hiking paths, and historical exploration routes, innovation would accelerate with a large and diverse corpus. We created a corpus of sentences labeled as describing geographic movement or not and including the type of entity moving. Creating this corpus proved difficult without any comparable corpora to start with, high human labeling costs, and since movement can at times be interpreted differently. To overcome these challenges, we developed an iterative process employing hand labeling, crowd voting for confirmation, and machine learning to predict more labels. By merging advances in word embeddings with traditional machine learning models and model ensembling, prediction accuracy is at an acceptable level to produce a large silver-standard corpus despite the small gold-standard corpus training set.

In effect, more efficient traffic represents a more efficient economy. Solving the issue of congestion by increasing the number of roads is not always the most cost-effective solution as it represents massive changes in city infrastructures that have been present for decades. Urban planning shapes the environment around us but fails to address specifically the future traffic clogging. Our research tackles the problem of traffic congestion by proposing a system for vehicle detection, identification, and count, allied with reinforcement learning for traffic congestion anticipation and prediction. The need for a real-time and efficient system led us to push the research and development onto an Edge Computing platform using IoT and secure transactions using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Blockchain intervenes as a security protocol in the proposed system. The native form of Internet of Things does not include security protocols which are important to a large scale implementation. Ensuring the security of transactions and permanent access control is the main reason why blockchain is rooted in our system architecture.

Through superposition of human dynamics and urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users. Geolocated telecom data, obtained for the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify \u201cstay-points\u201d\u2014events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence, and diversity.

Some of the urban features that were found to be highly related to the creation of large, diverse and long-lasting clusters were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features, and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have a negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a \u201creversed urbanism\u201d methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning, and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled as a foundational design tool for inferring the success rates of highly performative urban places. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.","Year":2019,"Source title":"Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science","Authors":"Noyman A., Doorley R., Xiong Z., Alonso L., Grignard A., Larson K.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808319840668","Document Type":"Article","x":4.997273922,"y":4.7178053856},{"Cluster":2,"DocId":346,"Cited by":3.0,"Title":"Enhanced urban clustering in VANETs using online machine learning","Author Keywords":"Clustering algorithm; Machine learning; Urban environment; VANET","Abstract":"Clustering in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) is essential to mitigate different challenges and meet the required quality of communications.

The transportation mode information can help to improve urban planning, traffic management and journey planning. Though much work has been done on the transportation mode recognition using classic machine learning algorithms, the performance of these methods is not reasonable and heavily relies on the effectiveness of handcrafted features. In this paper, we leverage the strong representation ability of deep learning method and present a deep-learning-based algorithm for transportation mode recognition, namely CL-TRANSMODE, which is capable of accurately detecting multiple transportation modes. The algorithm first uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn appropriate and robust feature representations for transportation modes recognition. Then, an LSTM network performs a further learning of the temporal dependencies characteristics on the feature vectors of CNN output. To further enhance the accuracy of transportation mode recognition, several artificial segments and peak features are extracted from the raw sensor measurements. These features characterize the transportation modes over a much long period of time (minutes or hours). By combining the CNN-extracted features and handcrafted features, our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm can accurately differentiate eight transportation modes, i.e., walking, running, bicycling, driving a car, riding a bus, taking a metro, taking a train, or being stationary. Extensive experiments on both the SHL and HTC datasets demonstrate that use our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative algorithms.

One way to tackle the problem is to resort to the emerging technologies in artificial intelligence. Traffic light control is one of the most traditional and important instruments for urban traffic management. The present study proposes a traffic light control system enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework in a decentralized manner. In the framework, a traffic network is decomposed into regions represented by region agents. Each region consists of intersections, modeled by intersection agents who coordinate with neighboring intersection agents through communication. For each intersection, a collection of turning movement agents operate individually and implement optimal actions according to local control policies. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm for each turning movement agent, the intersection controllers are enabled with the capability to make their timing decisions in a complex and dynamic environment. In addition, the traffic light control operates with an advanced phase composition process dynamically combining compatible turning movements. Moreover, the collective operations performed by the agents in a road network are further coordinated by varying priority settings for relevant turning movements. A case study was carried out by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed control system while comparing it with an optimized vehicle-actuated control system. The results show that the proposed traffic light system, after a collective machine learning process, not only improves the local signal operations at individual intersections but also enhances the traffic performance at the regional level through coordination of specific turning movements. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Year":2018,"Source title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","Authors":"Jin J., Ma X.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.engappai.2017.10.013","Document Type":"Article","x":5.3809609413,"y":5.1460571289},{"Cluster":1,"DocId":491,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"Revealing functional regions via joint matrix factorization based model","Author Keywords":"Functional Regions Revealing; Functions distribution discovery; Human mobility pattern; Joint NMF","Abstract":"Various functions in the region are emerging with the process of urbanizations, such as the residential, entertainment or hospital districts, which can be indicated during the urban planning.

Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also, segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the location traces.

Growing availability of Web 2.0, i.e. the increasing amount of websites with mainly user created content and social platforms opens up an opportunity to study such location\u2019s contexts. This paper investigates relationships existing between human behavior and location context, by analyzing log mobile phone data records. First an advanced approach to categorize areas in a city based on the presence and distribution of categories of human activity (e.g., eating, working, and shopping) found across the areas, is proposed. The proposed classification is then evaluated through its comparison with the patterns of temporal variation of mobile phone activity and applying machine learning techniques to predict a timeline type of communication activity in a given location based on the knowledge of the obtained category vs. land-use type of the locations areas. The proposed classification turns out to be more consistent with the temporal variation of human communication activity, being a better predictor for those compared to the official land use classification. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2016.","Year":2016,"Source title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","Authors":"Dashdorj Z., Sobolevsky S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-662-53416-8_10","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":5.0723404884,"y":4.7441334724},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":555,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"A comparison among various classification algorithms for travel mode detection using sensors' data collected by smartphones","Author Keywords":null,"Abstract":"Nowadays, machine learning is used widely for the purpose of detecting the mode of transportation from data collected by sensors embedded in smartphones like GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope. A lot of different classification algorithms are applied for this purpose. This study provides a comprehensive comparison among various classification algorithms on the basis of accuracy of results and computational time. The data used was collected in Kobe city, Japan using smartphones and covers seven transport modes. After feature extraction, the data was applied to algo-rithms namely Support Vector Ma-chine, Neural Network, Decision Tree, Boosted Decision Tree, Random Forest and Na\u00efve Bayes. Results indicat-ed that boosted decision tree gives highest accuracy but random forest is much quicker with accuracy slightly lower than that of boosted decision tree. Therefore, for the purpose of travel mode detection, random forest is most suitable.","Year":2015,"Source title":"CUPUM 2015 - 14th International Conference on Computers in Urban Planning and Urban Management","Authors":"Shafique M.A., Hato E.","DOI":null,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":5.6475543976,"y":4.9155993462},{"Cluster":1,"DocId":571,"Cited by":25.0,"Title":"Temporal decomposition and semantic enrichment of mobility flows","Author Keywords":"semantic decomposition; smart cities; topic modelling; urban mobility","Abstract":"Mobility data has increasingly grown in volume over the past decade as localisation technologies for capturing mobility flows have become ubiquitous. Novel analytical approaches for understanding and structuring mobility data are now required to support the backend of a new generation of space-time GIS systems. It is increasingly important as GIS is becoming a decision support platform for operations in fleet management, urban data analysis and related applications. This paper applies the machine learning method of probabilistic topic modelling for semantic enrichment of mobility data recorded in terms of trip counts by using geo-referenced social media data. It further explores the questions of causality and correlation, as well as predictability of the obtained semantic decompositions of mobility flows on a real dataset from a bike sharing network. \u00a9 2013 ACM.","Year":2013,"Source title":"Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Location-Based Social Networks, LBSN 2013 - Held in Conjunction with the 21st ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2013","Authors":"Coffey C., Pozdnoukhov A.","DOI":"10.1145\/2536689.2536806","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":5.2021465302,"y":5.156703949},{"Cluster":1,"DocId":574,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"Automated urban location annotation on mobile records","Author Keywords":null,"Abstract":"Location information is becoming much more important than ever before, especially in mobile services. Being widespread, less cost of energy and almost free for collecting data make mobile phone a perfect location sensor probe. Meaningful location name rather than digital coordinates could provide much more valuable information. In this paper, we develop a location semantic predicting method referred to Location Annotation(LA) which can automatically annotate meaningful base stations of phone users with semantic tags such as 'home', 'work place' and 'club'. We extract several explicit features from phone records and spatial-temporal patterns of mobile phone users to build an annotation model based on Maximum Entropy Model. Then a machine learning method is presented to estimate the best configuration of parameters in the model. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate good performance of our method. Overall accuracy is about 90% which outperforms simple and traditional classification methods by 10+%. Semantic location names are valuable to urban planning and optimization, transportation management and land use planning. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Year":2013,"Source title":"Proceedings - 2013 10th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery, FSKD 2013","Authors":"Huang W., Li M., Hu W., Song G., Xie K.","DOI":"10.1109\/FSKD.2013.6816332","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":5.0667471886,"y":4.7435050011},{"Cluster":2,"DocId":597,"Cited by":42.0,"Title":"Nested logit models and artificial neural networks for predicting household automobile choices: Comparison of performance","Author Keywords":null,"Abstract":"Over the past few years, machine-learning techniques have expanded enormously. These approaches are increasingly being applied to traffic and transportation problems formerly reserved for formal statistical approaches such as discrete choice models. Part of the reason for this has to do with research trends, but there are some potential advantages associated with such techniques, including the ability to model nonlinear systems; the ease with which symbolic, nominal, or categorical variables can be included; and the ability of these methods to deal with noisy data. The use of two modeling techniques, the nested logit model and the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, was investigated in terms of their applicability to the household vehicle choice problem. Both methods generated strong results, although the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network yielded better predictive potential.","Year":2002,"Source title":"Transportation Research Record","Authors":"Mohammadian A., Miller E.J.","DOI":"10.3141\/1807-12","Document Type":"Article","x":5.2143735886,"y":5.4141216278}]
