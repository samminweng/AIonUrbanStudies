Prior studies mainly present the street quality using objective indicators like tree counts and distance to parks with land use data, or most recently using the greenery view index extracted from street view imagery (SVI). We argue objective indicators cannot completely describe people's sense of a place, as perception is a highly subjective process. We hypothesize that subjective measures using visual surveys could capture more subtle human perceptions, thus providing stronger predictive power to housing prices. However, the role of subjectively measured street design qualities is less known due to the lack of large-scale perception data. To test our hypothesis, we first collected designers\u2019 perceptions on five urban design qualities from pairwise SVIs rankings in Shanghai with an online visual survey. Unlike the mainstream of using generic image features, we followed urban design theory and used rule-based features, i.e., about thirty streetscape elements extracted from SVIs to train machine learning (ML) models to predict subjective perceptions. The predictive power of five qualities versus ten selected individual streetscapes on housing price were compared using the hedonic price model. Besides the standard ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were also developed to account for the spatial dependence and heterogeneity effects. We found both subjectively measured design qualities and objective indicators outperformed housing structural attributes in explaining housing price. While the objective view indexes collectively explained more price variances, the five perceptions individually exhibited stronger strength. Third, less-studied perceptions like \u201chuman scale\u201d showed stronger strength than commonly studied \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cenclosure\u201d. Fourth, less-studied view indexes like \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cfence\u201d outperformed ubiquitous features like trees and buildings. Lastly, prior studies might have resulted in biased estimations due to ignoring the multicollinear issues between the sky, tree and building views. Our study addressed the effectiveness of incorporating subjective perceptions at a micro level to infer housing prices. correlations between subjective perceptions were strong while that of objective indicators were negligible, therefore subjective perceptions can complement the objective indicators. The findings provide important reference to decision makers when selecting street quality indicators to infer urban design, city planning and community and housing development plans. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Year":2022,"Source title":"Landscape and Urban Planning","Authors":"Qiu W., Zhang Z., Liu X., Li W., Li X., Xu X., Huang X.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2022.104358","Document Type":"Article","x":9.3391008377,"y":4.6035404205},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":5,"Cited by":null,"Title":"A comprehensive study of the COVID-19 impact on PM2.5 levels over the contiguous United States: A deep learning approach","Author Keywords":"Community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model; COVID-19; Deep convolutional neural network; Google mobility reports; PM2.5 estimation; United States","Abstract":"We investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PM2.5 levels in eleven urban environments across the United States: Washington DC, New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Detroit, Phoenix, and Seattle.

Nevertheless, the oversimplification and inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy, inherited in the UHI concept, is increasingly manifest today in the continuously urbanized world. In this study, we conduct a holistic and in-depth survey of the inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy intrinsic to the definition of UHI, from theoretical, technical, and practical perspectives.

An accurate mapping of GI is important to provide surface parameterization for model development. However, the accuracy and precision of mapping GI is still a challenge in identifying GI at the small catchment scale. We proposed a framework for blue-green-gray infrastructure classification using machine learning algorithms and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that contained digital surface model (DSM) information. We used the campus of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, as a study case for our classification method. The UAV was a DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral, which measures the blue, green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared bands and DSM information. Six machine learning algorithms, i.e., fuzzy classifier, k-nearest neighbor classifier, Bayes classifier, classification and regression tree, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were used to classify blue (including water), green (including green roofs, grass, trees (shrubs), bare land), and gray (including buildings, roads) infrastructure. The highest kappa coefficient was observed for RF and the lowest was observed for SVM, with coefficients of 0.807 and 0.381, respectively. We optimized the sampling method based on a chessboard grid and got the optimal sampling interval of 11.6\u00a0m to increase the classification efficiency. We also analyzed the effects of weather conditions, seasons, and different image layers, and found that images in overcast days or winter days could improve the classification accuracy. In particular, the DSM layer was crucial for distinguishing green roofs and grass, and buildings and roads. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using UAV images in urban blue-green-gray infrastructure classification, and our infrastructure classification framework based on machine learning algorithms is effective. Our results could provide the basis for the future urban stormwater management model development and aid sustainable urban planning.

In the early stages of historical heritage conservation, the focus was on the museum-style concept for individual structures.

However, it remains unclear whether urban morphological elements suitable for urban areas can be applied to heritage areas.

A data-driven approach to trace effects on urban form in France and Germany","Author Keywords":"Comparative; land policy; random forest; urban analytics; urban form","Abstract":"Against the backdrop of rapidly expanding urban structures, land policies in many countries have been adapted to contain and redirect growth to existing urban structures. However, obstacles remain to measure the effects of policies. In the meantime, geoinformation technologies have given rise to a wide range of approaches to measure and describe urban form. Nevertheless, its application for the assessment of land policy has a high, but not yet fully exploited, potential. It is thus the aim of this research to address and investigate the options of spatial analysis and machine learning in particular to analyse urban form from a land policy perspective. To do so, we develop urban metrics informed by urban planning and land readjustment policies of two countries describing urban form on different spatial levels. We therefore formulate hypotheses on causal relations between policy and form. Based on the metrics, we apply the random forest algorithm to classify the building stock of the region. We then extract the residential areas, those with single-family houses, as this is where the effects of the policy are considered most visible. In a next step, we use random forest to predict the nationality of a building. Through variable importance measures, we identify and discuss urban morphological differences between the two countries and test the hypotheses on effects of land policies. We develop and test the approach for the French-German city-region of Strasbourg using OpenStreetMap data. We identify significant differences in the building coverage ratios, which tend to be higher in Germany. This can be linked to differences in planning regulations. Furthermore, German residential areas appear to be more diverse in urban form. Differences in land readjustment policies have proven to be plausible here, as French policies favour strong actors that develop residential areas more uniformly. In Germany, policies favour fragmented ownership-oriented development of residential areas. The metrics and the applied algorithm for building classification have proven to be robust in terms of data heterogeneity and have shown high levels of accuracy. They could also be successfully used for tracing causal relations. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.","Year":2022,"Source title":"Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science","Authors":"Jehling M., Hecht R.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808321995818","Document Type":"Article","x":9.0054035187,"y":4.5081472397},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":24,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"Urban soils as a spatial indicator of quality for urban socio-ecological systems","Author Keywords":"Andes; Cities; Environmental Quality; Machine learning; Volcanic urban soils","Abstract":"The development of criteria and indicators to quantify the transition to sustainability of the urban socio-ecological systems quality is determinant for planning policies and the 21st century urban agenda.

Regression models can be used to replace LES simulations in estimating air pollutant concentrations, unless higher accuracy is needed.

While previous studies rely on heuristic (e.g., period of stay) and probabilistic (Shannon entropy) approaches, this paper proposes a method for classifying tourists and residents based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and considering parameters that could explain the variability between the two (e.g., weather, mobility, and photo content). This approach was applied to Flickr users\u2019 geotagged photos taken in Tokyo\u2019s 23 special wards from July 2008 to December 2019. The results show that stacked ensemble (SE) models are superior to models based on five supervised-learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), distributed random forest (DRF), deep learning (DL), and extremely randomized trees (XRT). Temporal entropy (TEN), mobility on workdays, and frequent visits to amusement venues and crowded places influenced how users were classified. While temporal distribution showed similar monthly\/hourly patterns, spatial distribution varied. The proposed approach might pave the way for scholars to carry out future tourism research on different topics and subsequently support policymakers in the decision-making process, specifically in urban settings. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Year":2021,"Source title":"Information Technology and Tourism","Authors":"Derdouri A., Osaragi T.","DOI":"10.1007\/s40558-021-00208-3","Document Type":"Article","x":9.340004921,"y":4.5155820847},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":34,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Identifying urban built environment factors in pregnancy care and maternal mental health outcomes","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Postpartum depression; Pregnancy care","Abstract":"Backgrounds: Risk factors related to the built environment have been associated with women\u2019s mental health and preventive care. This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients\u2019 residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients\u2019 residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Results: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. Conclusions: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD.

It also has positive effects on urban vibrancy, public health, and social connections in that community. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the visual quality at the urban street level using street view images. However, the spatial distribution of fine-grained visual quality inside an urban street is rarely investigated. This study presents a new approach for the evaluation of visual quality inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR point clouds. The semantic information of urban streets was first extracted from mobile LiDAR point clouds with a Gradient Boosting classifier. After that, seven well-known key design elements, including the green space factor, sky view factor, enclosure rate, volume index, vehicle occurrence rate, motorization rate, and diversity, were calculated from the classified point clouds using a three-dimensional (3D) visibility model. Finally, the visual quality at 1 m grid resolution inside urban street was achieved automatically by using a random forest model which was trained based on perception samples. This approach has been validated on two study areas and the results indicated that the proposed approach is able to quantitatively examine the visual quality difference inside urban streets. The results generated by the proposed method also match well with the common sense of urban design experts, which are useful for architects and designers to develop best practices in the urban micro-renewal project and to refine the urban planning processes. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Year":2021,"Source title":"Building and Environment","Authors":"Wu B., Yu B., Shu S., Liang H., Zhao Y., Wu J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.108323","Document Type":"Article","x":9.2916841507,"y":4.5706911087},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":36,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation and Prediction from Socioeconomic Variables Using Automatic Feature Selection Procedure-Based Machine Learning Model","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural networks; Feature selection; Machine learning; Origin-destination (OD) matrix; Support vector machines; Urban transport planning","Abstract":"The origin-destination (OD) demand matrix plays an essential role in travel modeling and transport planning.

The M\u00e1laga region, Spain, was used as a case study. The proposed methodology involves two stages. First, an automatic feature selection procedure was developed to determine the most relevant socioeconomic variables, discarding the irrelevant ones.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR) were tested and compared using the most relevant variables as inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model can be more accurate than traditional methods and ML models without the feature selection procedure. In particular, SVR with feature selection slightly outperformed the combined model using ANNs.

We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K).

Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning technologies have contributed to the mapping and monitoring of multi-scale urban land uses, yet there lacks a holistic mapping framework that is compatible with different end users\u2019 demands. Moreover, land use mix has evolved to be a key component in modern urban settings, but few have explicitly measured the spatial complexity of land use or quantitively uncovered its driving forces. Addressing these challenges, here we developed a novel two-stage bottom-up scheme for mapping essential urban land use categories. In the first stage, we conducted object-based land use classification using crowdsourcing features derived from multi-source open big data and an automated ensemble learning approach. In the second stage, we identified parcel-based land use attributes, including the dominant type and mixture mode, by spatially correlating land parcels with the object-based results. Furthermore, we investigated the potential influencing factors of land use mix using principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. Experimental results in Ningbo, a coastal city in China, showed that the proposed framework could accurately depict the distribution and composition of urban land uses. At the object scale, the highest classification accuracy was as high as 86% and 78% for the major (Level I) and minor (Level II) categories, respectively. At the parcel scale, the generated land use maps were spatially consistent with the object-based maps. We found larger parcels were more likely to be mixed in land use, and industrial lands were characterized as the most complicated category. We also identified multiple factors that had a collective impact on land use mix, including geography, socioeconomy, accessibility, and landscape metrics. Altogether, our proposed framework offered an alternative to investigating urban land use composition, which could be applied in a broad range of implications in future urban studies. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan.

In this study, the influence of urban form on the street-level air pollution distribution was comprehensively assessed according to the urban factors, high-resolution meteorological data, PM2.5 and CO concentration data collected via mobile monitoring along roads in Wuhan.

The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction. \u00a9 2021","Year":2021,"Source title":"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Authors":"Ros\u00e9s R., Kadar C., Malleson N.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101660","Document Type":"Article","x":9.3039855957,"y":4.4444894791},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":68,"Cited by":3.0,"Title":"Geospatial simulation of urban neighbourhood densification potentials","Author Keywords":"Archetype; Compact city; Machine learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban structure unit","Abstract":"Although densification of urban areas is being proposed as a sustainable urbanisation strategy, frameworks for detailed large-scale analysis of densification potentials and their evaluation are lacking. A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4\u201315 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)","Year":2021,"Source title":"Sustainable Cities and Society","Authors":"Eggimann S., Wagner M., Ho Y.N., Z\u00fcger M., Schneider U., Orehounig K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103068","Document Type":"Article","x":9.1713657379,"y":4.5259346962},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":70,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Meta-regression framework for energy consumption prediction in a smart city: A case study of Songdo in South Korea","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Energy consumption; Ensemble meta regressor; Machine learning; Smart city; Topical information","Abstract":"Nowadays the concept of smart city has gained in popularity in urban studies. A smart city collects diverse information to monitor and analyze urban systems, such as energy management. It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem.

We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting.

Istanbul has been experiencing rapid urban expansion for the past 60\u00a0years. This urban expansion is leading to the replacement of forests by various artificial surfaces. This situation has a critical impact on the natural surfaces due to the alteration of heat energy balance. In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use\/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3\u00a0km2, and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260\u00a0km2. Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years. \u00a9 2021, Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).","Year":2021,"Source title":"Applied Geomatics","Authors":"Khorrami B., Heidarlou H.B., Feizizadeh B.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12518-020-00350-3","Document Type":"Article","x":9.4351797104,"y":4.5872421265},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":75,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Ai augmented approach to identify shared ideas from large format public consultation","Author Keywords":"City; Data analysis; Natural language processing; Public participation; Urban planning","Abstract":"Public data, contributed by citizens, stakeholders and other potentially affected parties, are becoming increasingly used to collect the shared ideas of a wider community. Having collected large quantities of text data from public consultation, the challenge is often how to interpret the dataset without resorting to lengthy time-consuming manual analysis. One approach gaining ground is the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Based on machine learning technology applied to analysis of human natural languages, NLP provides the opportunity to automate data analysis for large volumes of texts at a scale that would be virtually impossible to analyse manually. Using NLP toolkits, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying and visualising shared ideas from large format public consultation. The approach analyses grammatical structures of public texts to discover shared ideas from sentences comprising subject + verb + object and verb + object that express public options. In particular, the shared ideas are identified by extracting noun, verb, adjective phrases and clauses from subjects and objects, which are then categorised by urban infrastructure categories and terms. The results are visualised in a hierarchy chart and a word tree using cascade and tree views. The approach is illustrated using data collected from a public consultation exercise called \u201cShare an Idea\u201d undertaken in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the 2011 earthquake. The approach has the potential to upscale public participation to identify shared design values and associated qualities for a wide range of public initiatives including urban planning. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

These concepts include technical, economic and social innovations. This term has been tossed around by various actors in politics, business, administration and urban planning since the 2000s to establish tech-based changes and innovations in urban areas. The idea of the smart city is used in conjunction with the utilization of digital technologies and at the same time represents a reaction to the economic, social and political challenges that post-industrial societies are confronted with at the start of the new millennium. The key focus is on dealing with challenges faced by urban society, such as environ-mental pollution, demographic change, population growth, healthcare, the financial crisis or scarcity of resources. In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently. Throughout this paper, it will be discussed in detail how AI-powered IoT and WSNs are applied in the healthcare sector.

Recent advances in remote sensing and social sensing data and methods have shown great potentials in mapping urban land use categories, but they are still constrained by mixed land uses, limited predictors, non-localized models, and often relatively low accuracies. To inform these issues, we proposed a robust and cost-effective framework for mapping urban land use categories using openly available multi-source geospatial \u201cbig data\u201d. With street blocks generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the minimum classification unit, we integrated an expansive set of multi-scale spatially explicit information on land surface, vertical height, socio-economic attributes, social media, demography, and topography. We further proposed to apply the automatic ensemble learning that leverages a bunch of machine learning algorithms in deriving optimal urban land use classification maps. Results of block-level urban land use classification in five metropolitan areas of the United States found the overall accuracies of major-class (Level-I) and minor-class (Level-II) classification could be high as 91% and 86%, respectively. A multi-model comparison revealed that for urban land use classification with high-dimensional features, the multi-layer stacking ensemble models achieved better performance than base models such as random forest, extremely randomized trees, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks. We found without very-high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery, the classification results derived from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and other open big data based features could achieve plausible overall accuracies of Level-I and Level-II classification at 88% and 81%, respectively. We also found that model transferability depended highly on the heterogeneity in characteristics of different regions. The methods and findings in this study systematically elucidate the role of data sources, classification methods, and feature transferability in block-level land use classifications, which have important implications for mapping multi-scale essential urban land use categories. \u00a9 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances.

In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. \u00a9 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Year":2021,"Source title":"Sustainable Development","Authors":"Tang B.-S., Ho W.K.O., Wong S.W.","DOI":"10.1002\/sd.2168","Document Type":"Article","x":9.4777345657,"y":4.5634422302},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":94,"Cited by":2.0,"Title":"Designing roadside green infrastructure to mitigate traffic-related air pollution using machine learning","Author Keywords":"Air quality; Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Particulate matter (PM); Urban designs; Vegetation","Abstract":"Communities located in near-road environments are exposed to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), causing adverse health effects. While roadside vegetation barriers can help mitigate TRAP, their effectiveness to reduce TRAP is influenced by site-specific conditions. To test vegetation designs using direct field measurements or high-fidelity numerical simulations is often infeasible since urban planners and local communities often lack the access and expertise to use those tools. There is a need for a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use method to evaluate vegetation barrier designs based on their capacity to mitigate TRAP. In this paper, we investigated five machine learning (ML) methods, including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and neural networks (NN), to predict size-resolved and locationally dependent particle concentrations downwind of various vegetation barrier designs. Data from 83 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations was used to train and test the ML models. We developed downwind region-specific models to capture the complexity of this problem and enhance the overall accuracy.

However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach.

The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences.

In recent years, the expansion of chain enterprises in new cities brings some challenges because of two aspects: (1) data scarcity in new cities, so most existing models tend to not work (i.e., overfitting), because the superior performance of these works is conditioned on large-scale training samples; (2) data distribution discrepancy among different cities, so knowledge learned from other cities cannot be utilized directly in new cities. In this article, we propose a task-adaptative model-agnostic meta-learning framework, namely, MetaStore, to tackle these two challenges and improve the prediction performance in new cities with insufficient data for optimal store placement, by transferring prior knowledge learned from multiple data-rich cities.

In addition, we design an effective learning strategy for MetaStore to promote faster convergence and optimization by sampling high-quality data for each training batch in view of noisy data in practical applications.

Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer\u2019s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Year":2021,"Source title":"Water Research","Authors":"Ward B.J., Andriessen N., Tembo J.M., Kabika J., Grau M., Scheidegger A., Morgenroth E., Strande L.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.watres.2021.116997","Document Type":"Article","x":9.2989931107,"y":4.6786923409},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":107,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Local and application-specific geodemographics for data-led urban decision making","Author Keywords":"Feature selection; Geodemographic classifications; Libraries; Recursive feature elimination; Urban planning","Abstract":"This work seeks to introduce improvements to the traditional variable selection procedures employed in the development of geodemographic classifications.

A framework introducing such techniques in the variable selection phase of geodemographic classification development is presented via a practical use-case that is focused on generating a geodemographic classification with an increased capacity for discriminating the propensity for Library use in the UK city of Leeds. Two local classifications are generated for the city, one a general-purpose classification, and the other, an application-specific classification incorporating supervised Feature Selection methods in the selection of input variables.

Hence, every impact on every scale has a significant role. Those properties of the networks are decisive on the global ecosystem, so how they will be modified by climate change needs serious studies. The vast population of the urban areas exerts significant effects on climate change even though they cover a small proportion of the surface of the Earth; however, impacts of urbanization on climate and ecosystems remain inadequately understood. In the meantime, urbanization continues to increase and in 2030, two-thirds of the population is expected to be living in urban areas with an increasing rate in time. It is of great importance to elaborate on the relations between urbanization and climate. In this respect, the use of information technologies with an extensive computational capacity is one of the cornerstones of climate and urban studies. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the automated recognition of patterns from data. The use of machine learning algorithms can bring significant advantages to both understandings and predicting the climate. The computational power with big data, their ability to capture nonlinear behavior, and learn as new data arrive make machine learning a useful tool for understanding climate and developing urban planning.

However, built environments attenuate GPS signals by reflecting or blocking them resulting in some cases multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These effects cause range errors that degrade GPS positioning accuracy. Enhancements in the design of antennae and receivers deliver a level of reduction of multipath. However, NLOS signal reception and residual effects of multipath are still to be mitigated sufficiently for improvements in range errors and positioning accuracy. Recent machine learning-based methods have shown promise in improving pseudorange-based position solutions by considering multiple variables from raw GPS measurements. However, positioning accuracy is limited by low accuracy signal reception classification. Unlike the existing methods, which use machine learning to directly predict the signal reception classification, we use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based method to predict the pseudorange errors by considering the signal strength, satellite elevation angle and pseudorange residuals. With the predicted pseudorange errors, two variations of the algorithm are proposed to improve positioning accuracy. The first corrects pseudorange errors and the other either corrects or excludes the signals determined to contain the effects of multipath and NLOS signals. The results for a challenging urban environment characterized by high-rise buildings on one side, show that the 3-D positioning accuracy of the pseudorange error correction-based positioning measured in terms of the root mean square error is 23.3 m, an improvement of more than 70% over the conventional methods. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Year":2021,"Source title":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","Authors":"Sun R., Wang G., Cheng Q., Fu L., Chiang K.-W., Hsu L.-T., Ochieng W.Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/JIOT.2020.3037074","Document Type":"Article","x":9.2917709351,"y":4.557528019},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":113,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"A refined method of high-resolution remote sensing change detection based on machine learning for newly constructed building areas","Author Keywords":"Areas registration; Change detection; Deep learning; High-resolution remote sensing; Newly constructed building areas; SVM","Abstract":"Automatic detection of newly constructed building areas (NCBAs) plays an important role in addressing issues of ecological environment monitoring, urban management, and urban planning. Compared with low-and-middle resolution remote sensing images, high-resolution remote sensing images are superior in spatial resolution and display of refined spatial details. Yet its problems of spectral heterogeneity and complexity have impeded research of change detection for high-resolution remote sensing images. As generalized machine learning (including deep learning) technologies proceed, the efficiency and accuracy of recognition for ground-object in remote sensing have been substantially improved, providing a new solution for change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images. To this end, this study proposes a refined NCBAs detection method consisting of four parts based on generalized machine learning: (1) pre-processing; (2) candidate NCBAs are obtained by means of bi-temporal building masks acquired by deep learning semantic segmentation, and then registered one by one; (3) rules and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly adopted for classification of NCBAs with high, medium and low confidence; and (4) the final vectors of NCBAs are obtained by post-processing. In addition, area-based and pixel-based methods are adopted for accuracy assessment. Firstly, the proposed method is applied to three groups of GF1 images covering the urban fringe areas of Jinan, whose experimental results are divided into three categories: high, high-medium, and high-medium-low confidence. The results show that NCBAs of high confidence share the highest F1 score and the best overall effect. Therefore, only NCBAs of high confidence are considered to be the final detection result by this method. Specifically, in NCBAs detection for three groups GF1 images in Jinan, the mean Recall of area-based and pixel-based assessment methods reach around 77% and 91%, respectively, the mean Pixel Accuracy (PA) 88% and 92%, and the mean F1 82% and 91%, confirming the effectiveness of this method on GF1. Similarly, the proposed method is applied to two groups of ZY302 images in Xi\u2019an and Kunming. The scores of F1 for two groups of ZY302 images are also above 90% respectively, confirming the effectiveness of this method on ZY302. It can be concluded that adoption of area registration improves registration efficiency, and the joint use of prior rules and SVM classifier with probability features could avoid over and missing detection for NCBAs. In practical applications, this method is contributive to automatic NCBAs detection from high-resolution remote sensing images. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Within the field of urban studies, an old question worth revisiting with these new technologies is how to best trace the spatial boundaries that circumscribe a place or location to explore non-work activity. In this study, we explore a data-driven definition of places as units of analysis that can be used to explore non-work activity in Singapore. Such a definition of place characterizes an urban space in terms of its concentration of activity and the topology of the built environment\u2013features that are especially important to urban planners. We utilize available smartphone data to develop a systematic framework to identify locations with a concentrated human presence. Using a cylinder moving over a grid representing Singapore, we scan aggregated smartphones locational requests (by time and cell), identifying areas with atypical high concentrations at a given time. Our tool identified 93 places with a concentrated human presence. Direct observation of six of these places at the selected times in conjunction with additional transportation and population data indicated that the topology of commercial establishments provided a strong approximation of non-work activity at a given time and place. Having established the relevance of commercial establishments in approximating non-work activity, then points-of-interest data within the 93 derived places are used to propose a typology of commercial patches, based on their spatial configuration. Nine metrics of the geometry and topology of patches of establishments, such as compacity and their dependence on proximity to shopping malls, were developed. These combined variables revealed more temporal and spatial variety within locations than had previously been recognized. The most popular places for non-work activity were densely configured with various commercial sub-spaces or patches appealing to different lifestyles and income groups. This study suggests that a location\/place can be best defined as a highly detailed, multi-faceted, and always evolving area of activity rather than as a fixed location with temporal and unmovable boundaries. Suggesting a dynamic redefinition of location\/place that builds on other recent work, this work offers potential contributions to locational models for non-work activity. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","Year":2021,"Source title":"Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science","Authors":"Lopez R.P., Ferreira J.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808320970209","Document Type":"Article","x":9.3301086426,"y":4.4881625175},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":128,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"A study on vehicle detection through aerial images: Various challenges, issues and applications","Author Keywords":"Aerial Images; Machine Learning; Security; Vehicle","Abstract":"Nowadays vehicle detection and counting at the border of countries, as well as states\/cities, has become popular through aerial images because of security concerns.

The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the \u201creach angle\u201d method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012\u20132020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited.

Recent studies combined the environmental contexts with residents\u2019 global positioning system (GPS) data to delineate the life circles. This method, however, is constrained by GPS data, and it can only be applied in the GPS surveyed communities. To address this limitation, this study developed a generalizable delineation method without the constraint of behavioral data. According to previous research, the community life circle consists of the walking-accessible range and internal structure. The core task to develop the generalizable method was to estimate the spatiotemporal behavioral demand for each plot of land to acquire the internal structure of the life circle, as the range can be delineated primarily based on environmental data. Therefore, behavioral demand estimation models were established through logistic regression and machine learning techniques, including decision trees and ensemble learning. The model with the lowest error rate was chosen as the final estimation model for each type of land. Finally, we used a community without GPS data as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimation models and delineation method.

In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus.

In many of these applications, the UAV is required to self-navigate in highly dynamic urban environments. This means that the UAV must have the ability to determine its location in an autonomous and real time manner. Existing localization techniques rely mainly on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and do not provide a reliable real time localization solution, particularly in dense urban environments. Our objective is to propose an effective alternative solution to enable the UAV to autonomously determine its location independent of the GPS and without message exchanges. We therefore propose utilizing the existing 5G cellular infrastructure to enable the UAV to determine its 3-D location without the need to interact with the cellular network. We formulate the UAV localization problem to minimize the error of the RSSI measurements from the surrounding cellular base stations. While exact optimization techniques can be applied to accurately solve such a problem, they cannot provide the real time calculation that is needed in such dynamic applications. Machine learning based techniques are strong candidates to provide an attractive alternative to provide a near-optimal localization solution with the needed practical real-time calculation. Accordingly, we propose two machine learning-based approaches, namely, deep neural network and reinforcement learning based approaches, to solve the formulated UAV localization problem in real time. We then provide a detailed comparative analysis for each of the proposed localization techniques along with a comparison with the optimization-based techniques as well as other techniques from the literature. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Year":2021,"Source title":"IEEE Access","Authors":"Afifi G., Gadallah Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2021.3126775","Document Type":"Article","x":9.5354528427,"y":4.5253119469},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":156,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Human Origin-Destination Flow Prediction Based on Large Scale Mobile Signal Data","Author Keywords":null,"Abstract":"The human origin-destination (OD) flow prediction is of great significance for urban safety control, stampede prevention, disease transmission control, urban planning, and many other aspects. Most of the existing methods generally divide the urban area into grids and use vehicle GPS trajectories and metrocard check-in data, combined with machine learning or deep learning models to predict human OD flow. However, these kinds of methods are challenging to capture fine-grained human mobility patterns. Moreover, these methods usually deviate from the actual human OD transfer patterns on a citywide scale due to the particularity of different datasets. To this end, in this paper, we use large-scale mobile phone signal data to achieve human OD flow prediction between the coverage of varying signal base stations. Many signal base stations are distributed in urban geographical space, collecting all the mobile phone user's location information to obtain large-scale fine-grained unbiased human OD flow data. Due to the lack of natural topology structure between base stations, this paper adopts a TGCN model combined with a graph fusion module to pretrain the dynamic population distribution prediction task. The parameters of the graph fusion module are employed to capture the different semantic information in the proposed hybrid machine learning method and finally achieve citywide human OD flow prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world signal datasets in Changchun, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. \u00a9 2021 Qiuyang Huang et al.","Year":2021,"Source title":"Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","Authors":"Huang Q., Yang Y., Xu Y., Wang E., Zhu K.","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/1604268","Document Type":"Article","x":9.3638305664,"y":4.5699796677},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":157,"Cited by":null,"Title":"From sonic experiences to urban planning innovations","Author Keywords":"crowdsourcing; smart cities; Soundscape research; tool support; urban planning","Abstract":"It is widely accepted that personal responses to soundscapes are more dependent on listeners\u2019 emotions and attitudes, than on sounds or their physical features alone. Fast-growing cities have catalyzed the importance of designing urban spaces that citizens find pleasant and homely and that support a communal style of living. Unfortunately, there are no standardized methods or techniques to translate sonic experiences into measurable and reliable data, which urban planning professionals or the building industry could turn into innovations and solutions. Most of the data pertaining to noise pollution and city soundscapes is still based on predictive acoustic models and rarely takes any real-life experiences or physical measurements into consideration. This paper presents the concept of a smart and participatory approach for gathering sonic experiences that could be translated into measurable values. The aim is to search for data collection methods to provide data to train deep learning. With machine learning methods, it is possible to find patterns in both desirable and undesirable urban soundscapes.

Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Year":2021,"Source title":"Urban Book Series","Authors":"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-76059-5_24","Document Type":"Book Chapter","x":9.4546298981,"y":4.6062464714},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":167,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Detection of Urban Built-Up Area Change from Sentinel-2 Images Using Multiband Temporal Texture and One-Class Random Forest","Author Keywords":"Built-up area change; improved one-class random forest (iOCRF); multiband temporal texture; multitemporal data; pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV)","Abstract":"Detection of urban land expansion is important for understanding the urbanization process and improving urban planning. Spatio-temporal contextual information derived from multitemporal high-resolution imagery is useful for highlighting urban land cover changes. This article proposes a new method for detecting urban built-up area change from multitemporal high spatial resolution imagery by combining spectral and spatio-temporal features. A multiband temporal texture measured using pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV) is adopted to quantify the local spatio-temporal dependence between bitemporal multispectral images. The PCMV textures at multiple scales, bitemporal spectral features, and normalized difference vegetation indices are together input to an improved one-class random forest classifier for urban built-up area change mapping. The proposed method is evaluated in urban built-up area change detection using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images of Tianjin area acquired from 2015 to 2019. It is also compared with three feature combinations and an existing postclassification comparison method based on one-class support vector machine.

Moreover, the proposed method also achieves the best performance using the bitemporal Sentinel-2 images over the east of Beijing area.

We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with \"oracle\"models that use hand-selected datasets. \u00a9 2021 ACM.","Year":2021,"Source title":"Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data","Authors":"Yan A., Howe B.","DOI":"10.1145\/3448016.3452777","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.4473705292,"y":4.5048985481},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":175,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"Analysis of built-up areas of small polish cities with the use of deep learning and geographically weighted regression","Author Keywords":"Build-up areas; Deep learning; GWR; Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*); Poland; Small cities","Abstract":"Small cities are an important part of the settlement system, a link between rural areas and large cities.

Street view images (SVIs) have shown great potential for automated land-use classification for land-use mapping.

This study proposes a novel land-use classification method that synthesizes location semantics from SVIs to account for contextual information from SVIs, land parcels and roads around the SVIs. The proposed method first generates land-use scene images (LUSIs) by using an SVI-derived straightforward algorithm.

For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. \u00a9 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Year":2020,"Source title":"Urban Forestry and Urban Greening","Authors":"Tang Z., Ye Y., Jiang Z., Fu C., Huang R., Yao D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ufug.2020.126871","Document Type":"Article","x":9.3205528259,"y":4.5810341835},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":207,"Cited by":21.0,"Title":"A data-driven approach for multi-scale GIS-based building energy modeling for analysis, planning and support decision making","Author Keywords":"Building energy performance; Data-driven approaches; Energy performance certificate; GIS modeling; Machine learning; Urban building energy modeling; Urban planning","Abstract":"Urban planners, local authorities, and energy policymakers often develop strategic sustainable energy plans for the urban building stock in order to minimize overall energy consumption and emissions. Planning at such scales could be informed by building stock modeling using existing building data and Geographic Information System-based mapping. However, implementing these processes involves several issues, namely, data availability, data inconsistency, data scalability, data integration, geocoding, and data privacy. This research addresses the aforementioned information challenges by proposing a generalized integrated methodology that implements bottom-up, data-driven, and spatial modeling approaches for multi-scale Geographic Information System mapping of building energy modeling. This study uses the Irish building stock to map building energy performance at multiple scales. The generalized data-driven methodology uses approximately 650,000 Irish Energy Performance Certificates buildings data to predict more than 2 million buildings\u2019 energy performance. In this case, the approach delivers a prediction accuracy of 88% using deep learning algorithms. These prediction results are then used for spatial modeling at multiple scales from the individual building level to a national level. Furthermore, these maps are coupled with available spatial resources (social, economic, or environmental data) for energy planning, analysis, and support decision-making. The modeling results identify clusters of buildings that have a significant potential for energy savings within any specific region. Geographic Information System-based modeling aids stakeholders in identifying priority areas for implementing energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the stakeholders could target local communities for retrofit campaigns, which would enhance the implementation of sustainable energy policy decisions. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Year":2020,"Source title":"Applied Energy","Authors":"Ali U., Shamsi M.H., Bohacek M., Purcell K., Hoare C., Mangina E., O'Donnell J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apenergy.2020.115834","Document Type":"Article","x":9.496263504,"y":4.5957860947},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":210,"Cited by":null,"Title":"From PIace2Vec to Multi-Scale Built-Environment Representation: A General-Purpose Distributional Embedding for Urban Data Analysis","Author Keywords":"Geo-Semantics; Machine Learning; Points of Interest; Similarity","Abstract":"Built environments like cities, roads, communities are rich sources of urban data. Many downstream applications require comprehensive analysis like geographic information retrieval, recommender systems, geographic knowledge graphs, and in general, understanding urban spaces [28]. Points of Interests (POI), as one of the most researched aspects of urban data, has been successfully modeled using concepts borrowed from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the work of Place2Vec [28], a Word2Vec-like statistical model is proposed to represent spatial adjacency with a continuous embedding space.

Many cities in these states show high growth dynamics, but little is known about the relation of conflicts and urban growth. In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime, which lasted from 1996 to 2001, caused large scale displacement of the population. People from Afghanistan migrated to neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan, and all developments came to a halt. After the US invasion in October 2001, all the major cities in Afghanistan experienced significant population growth, in particular, driven by the influx of internally displaced persons. Maximum pressure of this influx was felt by the capital city, Kabul. This rapid urbanization, combined with very limited capacity of local authorities to deal with this growth, led to unplanned urbanization and challenges for urban planning and management. This study analyses the patterns of growth between 2001 and 2017, and the factors influencing the growth in the city of Kabul with the help of high-resolution Earth Observation-based data (EO) and spatial logistic regression modelling. We analyze settlement patterns by extracting image features from high-resolution images (aerial photographs of 2017) and terrain features as input to a random forest classifier. The urban growth is analyzed using an available built-up map (extracted from IKONOS images for the year 2001). Results indicate that unplanned settlements have grown 4.5 times during this period, whereas planned settlements have grown only 1.25 times. The unplanned settlements expanded mostly towards the west and north west parts of the city, and the growth of planned settlements happened mainly in the central and eastern parts of the city. Population density and the locations of military bases are the most important factors that influence the growth, of both planned and unplanned settlements. The growth of unplanned settlement occurs predominantly in areas of steeper slopes on the hillside, while planned settlements are on gentle slopes and closer to the institutional areas (central and eastern parts of the city). We conclude that security and availability of infrastructure were the main drivers of growth for planned settlements, whereas unplanned growth, mainly on hillsides, was driven by the availability of land with poor infrastructure. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average.

Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions.

Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity.

Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities\u2019 evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation.

Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments.

In the north coverage condition, BeiDou has the best positioning performance, with a minimum of 4 visible satellites and 99% of PDOP values are less than 10. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Year":2020,"Source title":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","Authors":"Wu Y., Yang Z., Xu N., Yu J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1742-6596\/1550\/3\/032007","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.2618188858,"y":4.558511734},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":250,"Cited by":3.0,"Title":"Design of machine learning model for Urban planning and management improvement","Author Keywords":"Creative computing approach; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Urban planning and management","Abstract":"With the aid of artificial intelligence, this paper builds a machine learning model with the KNN algorithm to optimize the traditional method of urban planning and management (UPM). The optimization is realized through two steps. First, the relevant theories of the updated UPM of livelihood oriented UPM (LOUPM) are explored for the later machine learning architecture design. People's livelihood has a great influence on UPM. Livelihood orientation makes the complex UPM even more complicated due to diverse living needs of citizens. This paper analyzes the deeper relationship between the people's livelihood and UPM, systematically studies the function and connotation of the people's livelihood behavior, and profoundly discusses current contradictions and restraining factors. Second, based on a better understanding of LOUPM, this paper further proposes an artificial intelligence approach to select most related factors to optimize UPM from databases. In the first paper of this series, in the analysis of the relevant UPM theories, three scopes of LOUPM are concluded to be the evaluation of data sets: authority, time, and space. Then, this paper continues to design a software model with the KNN algorithm to evaluate the urban plans and generates optimization advice for the user. Based on this research, it is possible to explore LOUPM. In order to make every effort to seek ways and methods to meet the challenge of the LOUPM in the new period, and by introducing a creative computing approach of government management and social governance, this article can contribute to the growing demand of China's urbanization process. \u00a9 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.

Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Year":2020,"Source title":"Remote Sensing","Authors":"Fanos A.M., Pradhan B., Alamri A., Lee C.-W.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12111755","Document Type":"Article","x":9.1311101913,"y":4.6094908714},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":254,"Cited by":28.0,"Title":"Local climate zone mapping as remote sensing scene classification using deep learning: A case study of metropolitan China","Author Keywords":"Convolutional neural network; Local climate zone; Metropolitan China; Scene classification; Urban climate","Abstract":"China, with the world's largest population, has gone through rapid development in the last forty years and now has over 800 million urban citizens. Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400\u20131,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48\u00d748 corresponding to 480\u00d7480 m2) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10\u00d710) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32\u00d732 to 64\u00d764 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application. \u00a9 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Much has been speculated, but not much has been tested regarding the impacts of ride-sourcing services on the transportation system. In this study, we examine the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership of households, by using the most up-to-date (2017) national household travel survey data. To better capture the effect of ride-sourcing services on vehicle ownership, we controlled for the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of households and built environment variables, i.e., density, diversity, design, and distance to transit. Two approaches were used to model vehicle ownership: a probabilistic or inferential model (i.e., multilevel Poisson), and a machine learning method (i.e., random forest). This is the first study to utilize such advanced methods to model vehicle ownership and capture non-linear relationships, using the largest sample of household travel records ever assembled for such a study. The results suggest that there is a negative correlation between using ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership. Vehicle ownership is also negatively associated with the number of years Uber, as the biggest ride-sourcing service, has operated in a county. The relative contributions of ride-sourcing variables, however, are very limited compared to other variables controlled in this study which makes intuitive sense. For urban planning and design practices, this study suggests that the probability of car shedding will increase if the usage of ride-sourcing services becomes a habit, these services become more available, and built environments become more dense, connected, and transit-served. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Year":2020,"Source title":"Landscape and Urban Planning","Authors":"Sabouri S., Brewer S., Ewing R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2020.103797","Document Type":"Article","x":9.2616653442,"y":4.5682282448},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":257,"Cited by":7.0,"Title":"Identifying the Structure of Cities by Clustering Using a New Similarity Measure Based on Smart Card Data","Author Keywords":"city structure; clustering analysis; data mining; public transportation; Smart cards","Abstract":"Identifying the structure of cities has long been studied in urban planning and traffic modeling. This study presents a reliable method that reveals the structure of cities mainly based on clustering analysis using a new similarity measure. Several previous studies have used well-known clustering algorithms in machine learning fields, such as k-means clustering based on temporal mobility patterns of regions, whereas other studies have applied community detection algorithms on networks that depict traffic flows. However, the former does not reflect spatial interactions among places or areas, and the latter groups' places or areas with different land uses into the same cluster. To address these issues in existing approaches, this study proposes a new similarity method that considers not only temporal mobility patterns of areas but also spatial interactions with other areas. Moreover, the study combines spectral clustering repeated several times with hierarchical clustering to obtain a reliable structure that keeps the contiguity of clusters and determine the hierarchy of different areal units. The application of the proposed method to the data for Seoul, South Korea, reveals that the proposed clustering process divides a city into relatively homogeneous areas in terms of land uses. The flow maps based on the clustering results also revealed the spatial interactions between different areas and identify the polycentric structure of Seoul. \u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.","Year":2020,"Source title":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","Authors":"Kim K.","DOI":"10.1109\/TITS.2019.2910548","Document Type":"Article","x":9.4015769958,"y":4.5185680389},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":265,"Cited by":19.0,"Title":"Patterns of historical and future urban expansion in Nepal","Author Keywords":"Cropland loss; Machine learning models; Markov chain; Urban expansion","Abstract":"Globally, urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented rate at the cost of agricultural and forested lands in peri-urban areas fringing larger cities. Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover.

The generative model can produce heat maps that can be used to predict quantitatively the cycling and running activity in a given area, and then use urban design to enhance urban vitality in that area. In the machine learning model, the input image is a plan view of the built environment, and the output image is a heat map showing certain activities in the corresponding area. After it is trained, the model yields output (the predicted heat map) at an acceptable level of accuracy. The heat map shows the levels and conditions of the subject activity in different sections of the built environment. Thus, the predicted results can help identify where regional vitality can be improved. Using this method, designers can not only predict the behavioral heat distribution but also examine the different interactions between behaviors and aspects of the environment. The extent to which factors might influence behaviors is also studied by generating a heat map of the modified plan.

Managing the urban economy needs to consider environmental restrictions, environmental monitoring tasks, engineering facilities, and transport. Operational control over the urban environment and the surrounding area can be produced using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the collected data can be processed using a wide range of software and hardware technologies related to the field of artificial intelligence. However, along with any fairly new technology, intelligent unmanned technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. Strengths are mobility and efficiency, relative cheapness, the possibility of a high degree of automation, whereas weaknesses are short flight time, dependence on weather conditions, the certain outstanding tasks of data management and processing.

Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles. Furthermore, technological and economic issues, as well as necessary data processing technologies, are discussed.

Such signals cause major GNSS positioning (also known as \u201cNLOS multipath\u201d) errors. In this paper, a novel NLOS multipath detection technique using a machine-learning approach to improve the positioning accuracy in urban environments is proposed. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to a direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of an NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. To consider the change in shape of the correlation values of NLOS signals and their temporal variation, we propose a method for constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based NLOS discriminator. Furthermore, we propose a method for applying the NLOS probability, which is the output of the CNN, to the positioning calculation. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conducted NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We compared the proposed method with a method using a simple NN. As the experiment results indicate, the proposed method can correctly discriminate approximately 98% of NLOS multipath signals, and the discrimination rate of the proposed CNN-based method is higher than that of the simple NN-based approach. Furthermore, we improved the positioning accuracy from 34.1 to 1.6 m using the proposed method and concluded that the proposed approach can increase the positioning accuracy in urban environments. \u00a9 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

The existing techniques include the multi-sensor integration, 3D map aid, using a dual-polarized antenna, an omnidirectional camera aid are proposed to solve the classification problem. However, they all require external hardware or up-to-date map, which is expensive or impractical for mass-market applications. Consistency checking with the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is widely used for the detection of NLOS signals, but it is efficient only when the majority of the received signals are LOS signals. Machine learning methods, including the decision tree, the support vector machine (SVM) have been explored to classify LOS and NLOS with good accuracy. However, all current machine learning based method only utilize information within one epoch, all the inter-epoch information and data features in time series are lost, and the information of signal propagation in the complex urban environments is not fully manifested in the Rinex level observation and NMEA level observations in one single epoch. In this paper, a multivariate Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (MLSTM-FCN) based signal classification method is proposed. With the aid of the convolution layer and long short term memory block, this method handles the data features in both time domain and value domain. Six time series features of GNSS signal, including differenced C\/N0, time differenced ambiguity, double difference phase and pseudorange, phase and pseudorange consistency are analyzed and used as the input of the MLSTM-FCN. Datasets from two locations in the urban Calgary are collected, each of which is used for training and testing purposes respectively. The results reveal that, compared to the SVM classification method, the overall testing accuracy of the newly proposed classifier is improved from 93.00% to 95.97% for the Rinex level observation, and from 92.99% to 93.83 for the NMEA level observation. This improved classification accuracy brought by the proposed classifier is encouraging since it will enhance the robustness of the conventional GNSS positioning and the shadow matching based navigation system by reducing unbounded NLOS signal errors in urban environments and result in significant improvement in positioning accuracy. Compared to the SVM classifier aided single point positioning (SPP) test, the accuracy in the form of RMS of the MLSTM-FCN aided SPP test can be improved by 24.3%, 17.8% and 24.4% in the East, North and Up directions respectively, and the rate of the valid solution can be increased from 99.02% to 99.94%. The new method has the potential to be widely applied by various receiver types with the output of the raw observation or only with the NMEA observations output. \u00a9 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

The results not only demonstrate associations between the surroundings and the target but also show the feasibility of a combinatory land use index in urban planning and design. \u00a9 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.","Year":2020,"Source title":"RE: Anthropocene, Design in the Age of Humans - Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, CAADRIA 2020","Authors":"Xia X., Tong Z.","DOI":null,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.4840869904,"y":4.5385379791},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":292,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Characterizing air quality in urban areas with mobile measurement and high resolution open spatial data: Comparison of different machine-learning approaches using a visual interface","Author Keywords":"Air quality; Dashboard; Land-use regression; Machine-learning","Abstract":"Air quality is one of the most important topics in our urban life, as it is of great significance for human health and urban planning. However, accurate assessment and prediction of air quality in urban areas are difficult. In major cities, typically only a limited number of air quality monitoring stations are available, and inferring air quality in the un-sampled areas throughout the city is challenging. On the other hand, air quality varies in the urban areas non-linearly; it is highly spatially dependent and considerably influenced by multiple factors, such as building distribution, traffic situation and land uses. In this research, we model air quality in the city of Augsburg using spatial features and high quality sensor data. We identify spatial features such as types and areas of different land uses, road networks with high resolution. We integrate open available data to the air quality prediction. In this regard, we compare a simple baseline model with linear regression models (Ordinary Least-Squares and Ridge Regression) and tree-based machine-learning models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest). In our evaluation, given the non-linearity of the data, tree-based models outperform all linear models, which are commonly used in literatures. In addition, we created an interactive and visual dashboard. This dashboard demonstrates the analytical workflow, gives insight into model performance and uncertainty and visualizes the results. \u00a9 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.","Year":2020,"Source title":"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST","Authors":"Shen Y., Lehmler S., Murshed S.M., Riedel T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-51005-3_12","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.2736587524,"y":4.5818972588},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":295,"Cited by":1.0,"Title":"Harnessing Social Interactions on Twitter for Smart Transportation Using Machine Learning","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Traffic incident detection; Twitter data analysis","Abstract":"Twitter is generating a large amount of real-time data in the form of microblogs that has potential knowledge for various applications like traffic incident analysis and urban planning.

The study includes the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms with different feature extraction and representation models for the identification of traffic incidents from the Twitter interactions. The comprehensive proposed approach is the combination of following four steps. In the first phase, a dictionary of traffic-related keywords is formed. Secondly, real-time Twitter data has been collected using the dictionary of identified traffic related keywords. In the third step, collected tweets have been pre-processed, and the feature generation model is applied to convert the dataset eligible for a machine learning classifier. Further, a machine learning model is trained and tested to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents.

Examples of street labels include arterials, major roads, minor roads and so forth based on their transportational use. City authorities on the other hand have been shifting to more wholistic planning of streets. The modern approach towards designing and planning streets is more inclusive of the street context, meaning the side use of a street combined with the transportational features of a street. Several city authorities are developing new classification schemes for street context that extends traditional classification methods to include the use of land on the sides of a street. In those classification schemes, streets are labeled for example as commercial throughway, residential neighborhood, park etc. This modern approach to urban planning have been adopted by major cities such as the city of San Francisco, the state of Florida and Pennsylvania among many others. Currently, the process of labeling streets according to their contexts is manual and hence is tedious and time consuming. It will require manual labor to regularly relabel streets as the city develops. In this paper, we propose an approach to deploy advancements in computer vision towards modern urban planning. We propose a framework for automatic classification of street contexts. Using labeled street imagery we train deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform the classification of street context. We show that CNN models can perform well achieving accuracies in the 81% to 87% range. We test various CNN architectures and report on their performances. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Year":2019,"Source title":"Proceedings - 18th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2019","Authors":"Alhasoun F., Gonzalez M.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2019.00198","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.3234844208,"y":4.52450037},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":322,"Cited by":18.0,"Title":"Data-driven model for cross ventilation potential in high-density cities based on coupled CFD simulation and machine learning","Author Keywords":"Coupled CFD simulation; Data-driven model; Early design support; High-density city; Machine learning; Urban ventilation","Abstract":"Effective urban ventilation through decent urban planning and building design can alleviate the deterioration of the urban built environment. However, natural ventilation requirements and guidelines in current building codes and standards are either qualitative or quantitative but subject to an absolute indoor airspeed threshold without considering the outdoor wind environment. To fill this gap, this paper develops an urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and defines a novel ventilation index to assess natural ventilation potential. The index considers wind environments of both indoor and outdoor spaces. First, the coupled CFD model is developed to study wind-driven cross ventilation in high-density cities. A 3D isothermal CFD simulation is solved using the RNG k-\u03b5 turbulent model. The simulation results are compared with wind tunnel experiment data from literature. Second, six key design variables are used to generate 3840 parametric design variations for natural ventilation assessment. Third, a novel integrated index CIOIv (coupled indoor and outdoor interaction) is proposed to evaluate the wind speed ratio between the indoor area and outdoor reference area. For demonstration, CIOIv,F1 is used to represent CIOIv on the ground level. Data-driven CIOIv,F1 models are developed to predict indoor building ventilation potential for quick early design support. Compared with multivariate linear regression model, the Gradient Boosting non-linear model displays much higher prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error = 0.16 with R2 = 0.8). In early design stage, designers and engineers can skip the computational expensive CFD simulations and use this data-drive model to quickly check the building natural ventilation potentials of different design options in an urban environment. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Year":2019,"Source title":"Building and Environment","Authors":"Ding C., Lam K.P.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2019.106394","Document Type":"Article","x":9.7438354492,"y":4.6644148827},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":323,"Cited by":7.0,"Title":"An urban data framework for assessing equity in cities: Comparing accessibility to healthcare facilities in Cascadia","Author Keywords":"Equality; Gini index; Inclusivity; Machine learning; Self-organizing maps","Abstract":"As cities continue to grow worldwide, policymakers and urban planners face the dual task of meeting rising demand for essential services while ensuring that benefits accrue to their citizens equitably. We propose a framework for assessing inclusivity and equity in cities, which leverages open data and machine learning techniques to inform urban infrastructure investment strategies. The framework is applied at a regional scale to compare differential access to healthcare facilities (public hospitals and clinics) via public transit in Vancouver, Seattle and Portland. We find important distributional impacts on vulnerable populations across the three cities. Portland displays the highest inequity in hospital and clinic access, and Vancouver the least, owing to Vancouver's relatively compact geographic area and high population density. For seniors, over 75% are socially excluded from hospitals and over 50% from clinics in Portland, compared to 30% and 3% respectively in Vancouver. In all three cities, significantly more residents of low-income neighborhoods are excluded from healthcare compared to their counterparts in high-income neighborhoods. This translates into proportionally higher transportation costs for low-income area residents compared with high-income area residents, regardless of whether they are socially excluded or not. Transportation costs are notably high for low-income seniors in Seattle and Vancouver. These findings pose a challenge for inclusive planning, since low-income and senior populations may require specialized services and are more reliant on public transportation than the average population. Our evaluation framework provides a systematic approach for municipalities to account for the distributional effects of transportation and service infrastructure planning, to integrate equity into their decision-making, and to learn from the successes and pitfalls of each other's urban policies. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Year":2019,"Source title":"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Authors":"Mayaud J.R., Tran M., Nuttall R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101401","Document Type":"Article","x":9.2380504608,"y":4.5741896629},{"Cluster":2,"DocId":324,"Cited by":7.0,"Title":"Topic modeling to discover the thematic structure and spatial-temporal patterns of building renovation and adaptive reuse in cities","Author Keywords":"Big data; Building alteration; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Topic modeling","Abstract":"Building alteration and redevelopment play a central role in the revitalization of developed cities, where the scarcity of available land limits the construction of new buildings. The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts.

To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement.

Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424).

Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed. The created tool can be applied for the future tender procedures as a pre-test of a collusion appearance. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Year":2019,"Source title":"IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering","Authors":"Anysz H., Foremny A., Kulejewski J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/11\/112064","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.2278232574,"y":4.4751062393},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":379,"Cited by":18.0,"Title":"Identifying urban geometric types as energy performance patterns","Author Keywords":"Cluster analysis; Energy; Typology; Urban block; Urban form; Urban geometry","Abstract":"This paper aims to find the impact of geometric parameters on the energy performance of buildings, to using them to identify types regarding major geometric characteristics of a target area.

To achieve the aims of this study, this paper follows two steps: First, significant indicators for analyzing energy performance are identified in urban geometries; second, the types that capture urban geometry of a real city are categorized. As a result, as a reference for urban planning and design, the paper identifies 13 types that represent the characteristics of urban geometries regarding energy performance. The geometric indicators are carefully measured and their significance to energy performance of buildings is examined through regression analysis. According to these indicators, the 13 types are categorized using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, a machine learning method.

Particularly, predicting pedestrian crossings at crosswalks is of considerable importance for avoiding accidents on the one hand and not unnecessarily slowing down traffic on the other hand. Traditional model-based motion tracking and prediction approaches have difficulties in capturing abrupt changes in motions, as humans can perform them. In this paper, an approach for predicting pedestrian motions that combines established motion tracking algorithms with data-driven methods is presented. The approach is built upon a hierarchical structure, where first, the intent of each pedestrian is classified. Then, the approach computes several qualitative metrics, such as time-to-cross, for the pedestrians classified as crossing. The approach is evaluated on a challenging urban data set collected for different types of crosswalks such as roundabouts and straight roads. The evaluation also provides a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed approach. \u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.","Year":2019,"Source title":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","Authors":"Volz B., Mielenz H., Gilitschenski I., Siegwart R., Nieto J.","DOI":"10.1109\/TITS.2018.2827956","Document Type":"Article","x":9.5070781708,"y":4.5265417099},{"Cluster":1,"DocId":385,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Object Counting on Low Quality Images: A Case Study of Near Real-Time Traffic Monitoring","Author Keywords":"Monitoring; Object detection; Regression; Smart cities; Time series; Traffic; Transport","Abstract":"The installation and management of traffic monitoring devices can be costly from both a financial and human resource point of view.

This paper shows that different artificial intelligence techniques can be combined to provide the commander with various form of intelligence augmentation and to support the decision making process. A warfare model has been developed where an AI system, representing a red unit, learns how to select the position for a target and for several improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in order to prevent the blue unit to locate the target. The blue unit is trained to reach the target by using deep reinforcement learning, while an evolutionary algorithm is used to train the red unit. These techniques do not rely on large amounts of historical data. Different approaches have been used and discussed to optimise the co-learning of the two agents, showing that optimal behaviour can be learned in an urban environment. Information about the most likely positions of the target and the IEDs can be extracted from the policy learned by the system, and used by the commander to provide intelligence augmentation while planning an operation and evaluating different possible courses of action. The reliability of this information depends on the realism of the AI system simulating the red unit, that is strictly dependent on the model used for the blue unit during the training. \u00a9 COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Conventional LOS\/MP\/NLOS classifiers, referred to as national marine electronics association (NMEA)-level and receiver independent exchange format (RINEX)-level classifiers, are usually performed using attributes extracted from basic observables or measurements such as received signal strength, satellite elevation angle, code pseudorange, etc. The NMEA\/RINEX-level classification rate is limited because the complex signal propagation in urban environment is not fully manifested in these end attributes. In this paper, LOS\/MP\/NLOS features were extracted at the baseband signal processing stage. Multicorrelator is implemented in a GPS software-defined receiver (SDR) and exploited to generate features from the autocorrelation function (ACF). A robust LOS\/MP\/NLOS classifier using a supervised machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), is then trained. It is also proposed that the Skymask and code pseudorange double difference observable are used to label the real signal type. Raw GPS intermediate frequency data were collected in urban areas in Hong Kong and were postprocessed using a self-developed SDR, which can easily output correlator-level LOS\/MP\/NLOS features. The SDR measurements were saved in the file with the format of NMEA and RINEX. A fair comparison among NMEA-, RINEX-, and correlator-level classifiers was then carried out on a common ground. Results show that the correlator-level classifier improves the metric of F1 score by about 25% over the conventional NMEA- and RINEX-level classifiers for testing data collected at different places to that of training data. In addition to this finding, correlator-level classifier is found to be more feasible in practical applications due to its less dependency on surrounding scenarios compared with theNMEA\/RINEX-level classifiers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Year":2019,"Source title":"Remote Sensing","Authors":"Xu B., Jia Q., Luo Y., Hsu L.-T.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11161851","Document Type":"Article","x":9.3619689941,"y":4.5521492958},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":409,"Cited by":11.0,"Title":"Generative design and performance modeling for relationships between urban built forms, sky opening, solar radiation and energy","Author Keywords":"Energy performance; Generative design; Parametric modeling; Reinforcement learning; Urban design","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Year":2019,"Source title":"Sustainability (Switzerland)","Authors":"Ye Y., Xie H., Fang J., Jiang H., Wang D.","DOI":"10.3390\/su11061741","Document Type":"Article","x":9.3687677383,"y":4.6056613922},{"Cluster":2,"DocId":412,"Cited by":9.0,"Title":"Analyzing Objective and Subjective Data in Social Sciences: Implications for Smart Cities","Author Keywords":"Data analysis; data science; smart cities; social science; urban analytics; urban planning","Abstract":"The ease of deployment of digital technologies and the Internet of Things gives us the opportunity to carry out large-scale social studies and to collect vast amounts of data from our cities.

Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting.

However, it is difficult for operators to estimate the location of most commercial UEs because they cannot feedback their location information directly to their serving base stations with the exception of UEs with Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) functions specified in LTE Release 10. Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprint method is known as an effective localization method, with which we can estimate the location of UEs with only RF signature and location information beforehand. In LTE, RF fingerprint database can be collected by conducting drive tests or using measurement data from UEs compatible with MDT. Although the estimation accuracy can be better with more RF signatures, the increase in the amount of RF signatures causes the increase in the feedback, which consumes the uplink capacity and UE battery. Furthermore, keeping all RF signatures in database is inefficient because some RF signatures do not have effect on improving estimation accuracy. Hence, it is important to clarify the effect of each RF signature and use only effective ones in the localization. In this paper, we conducted a field experiment to create an RF fingerprint database in dense urban area, and evaluated the effectiveness of each RF signature by making several localization models based on machine learning.

The method is presented together with results from evaluations based on real sensor data that have been recorded in a realistic urban environment. Several scenarios have been recorded such as normal situations, a person loitering, a person shooting and people escaping from sudden smoke development. The method uses sensor data from a static video surveillance system, consisting of two visual and two thermal infrared cameras. The person detection method combines foreground segmentation with a trained machine learning algorithm which is based on boosting. The tracker associates incoming detections to objects (i.e. people), and generates tracks of world coordinates and velocities of objects. The anomaly detection method, which is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), fuses information that is derived from the tracker. The information contains a number of persons, their positions and velocities. The results indicate that the person detection method in combination with the tracker can produce robust and accurate observations to the HMM, which in turn provide good conditions for accurate anomaly detection. \u00a9 2018 SPIE.","Year":2018,"Source title":"Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","Authors":"Andersson M., Hemstr\u00f6m F., Molin S.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2326276","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.5820026398,"y":4.5337572098},{"Cluster":2,"DocId":470,"Cited by":null,"Title":"Investigating Customer Satisfaction Patterns in a Community Livability Context: An Efficiency-Oriented Decision-Making Approach","Author Keywords":null,"Abstract":"A comprehensive understanding of neighborhood facilities distribution and functions along with residential quality of life satisfaction is a key asset for relating livability management to transportation networks. Due to the simultaneous involvement of varied factors with an individual's perception of livability, this concept is difficult to measure. Therefore, a more objective means of quantifying livability is needed. The service industry has demonstrated the intersection of machine learning classifiers and survey domain knowledge for evaluating users' quality of experiences; however, this process of inquiry-based learning has never been considered for solving the communication difficulties between community stakeholders and transportation agencies. Another area of overlap is that of urban computing, which integrates computing technology in the traditional context of urban areas, connecting ubiquitous sensing technologies, computational power, and data about the urban environment to promote quality of life for people living in a particular community. To this aim, the focus of this study is on interpreting a linkage between society stated preferences and quantitative measures of livability by extracting information from survey-based methods and translating it to a quantitative framework using combined service industry and urban computing methodologies.

A ray-tracing software is employed to generate samples for multiple routes in a typical urban environment, and different altitudes of Tx and Rx UAVs are taken into consideration. Two machine-learning algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, are exploited to build prediction models on the basis of the training data. The prediction performance of trained models is assessed on the test set according to the metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, two empirical models are presented for comparison. It is shown that the machine-learning-based models are able to provide high prediction accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency in the AA scenario. Moreover, Random Forest outperforms other models and has the smallest prediction errors. Further investigation is made to evaluate the impacts of five different parameters on the path loss.

We hypothesize that most industries develop new entities based on the number of companies from the same industry that already exist in a region. We also hypothesize that entrepreneurs create new entities based on related industries operating within the same knowledge pool. To test these hypotheses, we used the machine learning decision tree method. The input variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland in 2009. The target values are the number of new companies from these industries created in the years 2009-2015. The principal results show that localization decisions are mostly based on demand and supply industries, in which manufacturing industries play crucial role. Path dependency appears in less than half of the industries' models and thus is not the main factor influencing decisions regarding the creation of new companies. The highest share of path-dependent industries is in manufacturing sector, but the degree of the dependence is lower than in the service sector. The service sector seems to be the least path-dependent, as services usually serve other industries.

While conventional CA and ANN models assign a cell to only one land-use class, in reality, a cell may belong to several land-use classes simultaneously. The recently developed multi-label (ML) concept overcomes this limitation in land change science. Although the ML concept is a new paradigm with nonexclusive classes and has shown considerable merit in several applications, few studies in land change science have applied it. In addition, determining transition rules in conventional CA is difficult when the number of drivers is large. Since CA has been shown as a potential model to consider neighborhood effects and ANN has been shown effective in determining CA transition rules, we integrated both CA with an ANN model to overcome limitations of each tool. In this study, we specifically extended the ANN-based Land Transformation Model (LTM) with both a CA-based model and the ML concept to create an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework. We also compared, using standard evaluation measures, differences between the proposed integrated model with a conventional CA-based LTM model (called the ml-CA-LTM). Parameterization was made using a learning and testing procedure common in machine learning. Results showed that the modified LUC model, ML-CA-LTM, produced consistently better goodness of fit calibration values compared to the ml-CA-LTM. The outcome of this modified model can be used by managers and decision makers for improved urban planning. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Year":2017,"Source title":"GIScience and Remote Sensing","Authors":"Omrani H., Tayyebi A., Pijanowski B.","DOI":"10.1080\/15481603.2016.1265706","Document Type":"Article","x":9.2588891983,"y":4.5338163376},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":498,"Cited by":36.0,"Title":"Forecasting smog-related health hazard based on social media and physical sensor","Author Keywords":"Data mining; Forecasting; Health hazard; Smog disaster; Social media; Urban data","Abstract":"Smog disasters are becoming more and more frequent and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas.

These cause major positioning (also known as \"NLOS multipath\") errors in GNSS positioning. This paper proposes a novel NLOS multipath detection technique that uses a machine-learning technique to improve positioning accuracy in urban environments. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the code-tracking process within GNSS receivers, the code correlation peak is determined and tracked using the outputs of the signal correlators. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to the direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. For realizing machine learning, we extract the features of the NLOS signal from the shape of the NLOS correlation function, using an actual dataset, to construct an NLOS classifier. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conduct NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We propose to construct an NLOS classifier based on a support vector machine. From the experiments, 87% of the LOS signals and 99% of the NLOS signals are correctly discriminated.

However, indoor natural ventilation requirements in current building standards only define absolute indoor air speed without considering outdoor conditions. To fill this gap, this paper developed generic urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor CFD models and proposes a new integrated index (CIOI index) to evaluate indoor natural ventilation potential, which couples both indoor and outdoor wind environments.

In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1\u00a0million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf and for residential buildings is 31.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings \u2013 those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall \u2013 are found to have lower natural gas use intensity.

Both classification and regression schemes are examined using the random forest algorithm. In both approaches, the localization performance depends mostly on arrival time information of received signals. It is shown that the use of a relative arrival time difference rather than the direct time of arrival (TOA) also provide good performance, which is beneficial for practical application. It is found that with enough number of receivers, the signal power parameter can be omitted, which eliminates frequency dependency of developed models. It is also found that at least three receivers should be used to achieve acceptable prediction performance. Additionally, the number of training examples needed depends on the approach used as well as the desired level of accuracy. This factor is more important in the classification approach, as the amount of training data required closely relates to the number of sectors created by the localization problem. A regression scheme is more natural for predicting spatial coordinate values, and achieved higher localization accuracy with fewer training examples as compared to classification. Ultimately, the regression based localization scheme using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) parameter at three receiver locations achieved an average localization accuracy of 2.8m. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Year":2016,"Source title":"Proceedings - IEEE Military Communications Conference MILCOM","Authors":"Bibb D.A., Yun Z., Iskander M.F.","DOI":"10.1109\/MILCOM.2016.7795360","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.386973381,"y":4.5299110413},{"Cluster":2,"DocId":520,"Cited by":8.0,"Title":"Thermal sensation prediction by soft computing methodology","Author Keywords":"Extreme leaning machine; PET; Prediction; Thermal comfort; Urban areas","Abstract":"Thermal comfort in open urban areas is very factor based on environmental point of view.

Therefore the main objective of this study is to present and investigate the SVM technique for modeling urban land use change. The SVM model building procedure is presented together with the detailed evaluation of the output results with respect to the choice of datasets, attributes and the change of SVM parameters. Geospatial datasets containing nine land use classes and spatial attributes for the Municipality of Zemun, Republic of Serbia were used for years 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2011. The Correlation-based Feature Subset method, kappa coefficient, Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and kappa simulation were used to perform the model evaluation and compare the model outputs with the real land use datasets.

While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

Water resources in urban areas are gradually decreasing due to the rapid urbanization, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the precise extraction and automatic identification of water bodies are of great significance and urgently required for urban planning. It should be noted that although some studies have been reported regarding the water-area extraction, to our knowledge, few papers concern the identification of urban water types (e.g., rivers, lakes, canals, and ponds). In this paper, a novel two-level machine-learning framework is proposed for identifying the water types from urban high-resolution remote-sensing images. The framework consists of two interpretation levels: 1) water bodies are extracted at the pixel level, where the water\/shadow\/vegetation indexes are considered and 2) water types are further identified at the object level, where a set of geometrical and textural features are used. Both levels employ machine learning for the image interpretation. The proposed framework is validated using the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 images, over two mega cities in China, i.e., Wuhan and Shenzhen, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved satisfactory accuracies for both water extraction [95.4% (Shenzhen), 96.2% (Wuhan)], and water type classification [94.1% (Shenzhen), 95.9% (Wuhan)] in complex urban areas. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.","Year":2015,"Source title":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","Authors":"Huang X., Xie C., Fang X., Zhang L.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2015.2420713","Document Type":"Article","x":9.2701053619,"y":4.6415657997},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":558,"Cited by":7.0,"Title":"Automatic sound recognition of urban environment events","Author Keywords":"Automatic sound recognition; Dimensionality redundancy; Urban environment","Abstract":"The audio analysis of speaker\u2019s surroundings has been a first step for several processing systems that enable speaker\u2019s mobility though his daily life.

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http:\/\/www.fp7-proactive.eu\/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques. A prototype implementation of layer is presented in a simulated validation scenario. The prototype allows an expert user to monitor threat probabilities for different physical environments, and influence the sensitivity of these environments in real-time as well as and provide feedback for adapting the machine learning models. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Year":2014,"Source title":"Proceedings - International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","Authors":"Archetti F., Djordjevic D., Giordani I., Sormani R., Tisato F.","DOI":"10.1109\/CCST.2014.6987009","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.5395450592,"y":4.5205845833},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":564,"Cited by":26.0,"Title":"A tool for urban soundscape evaluation applying Support Vector Machines for developing a soundscape classification model","Author Keywords":"Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines","Abstract":"To ensure appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Year":2014,"Source title":"Science of the Total Environment","Authors":"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108","Document Type":"Article","x":9.4106588364,"y":4.4868822098},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":566,"Cited by":10.0,"Title":"Using data mining techniques to detect the personality of players in an educational game","Author Keywords":"Classification; Conversation; Educational data; Larry's Rose framework; Natural language processing; Personality","Abstract":"One of the goals of Educational Data Mining is to develop the methods for student modeling based on educational data, such as; chat conversation, class discussion, etc. On the other hand, individual behavior and personality play a major role in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and Educational Data Mining (EDM).

In this work, we combine a dataset sourced from a telecommunication provider in Spain with a database of millions of geo-tagged venues from Foursquare and we formulate the problem of urban activity inference in a supervised learning framework. In particular, we exploit user communication patterns observed at the base station level in order to predict the activity of Foursquare users who checkin-in at nearby venues. First, we mine a set of machine learning features that allow us to encode the input telecommunication signal of a tower. Subsequently, we evaluate a diverse set of supervised learning algorithms using labels extracted from Foursquare place categories and we consider two application scenarios. Initially, we assess how hard it is to predict specific urban activity of an area, showing that Nightlife and Entertainment spots are those easier to infer, whereas College and Shopping areas are those featuring the lowest accuracy rates. Then, considering a candidate set of activity types in a geographic area, we aim to elect the most prominent one. We demonstrate how the difficulty of the problem increases with the number of classes incorporated in the prediction task, yet the classifiers achieve a considerably better performance compared to a random guess even when the set of candidate classes increases. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Year":2013,"Source title":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management","Authors":"Noulas A., Mascolo C., Frias-Martinez E.","DOI":"10.1109\/MDM.2013.27","Document Type":"Conference Paper","x":9.3495368958,"y":4.4639267921},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":577,"Cited by":5.0,"Title":"Classification of urban scenes from georeferenced images in urban street-view context","Author Keywords":"kernel-based machine learning; semantic image classification; spatial pyramid matching; street-level images; visual words","Abstract":"This paper addresses the challenging problem of scene classification in street-view georeferenced images of urban environments.

The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Year":2011,"Source title":"Landscape and Urban Planning","Authors":"Everaars J., Strohbach M.W., Gruber B., Dormann C.F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2011.05.008","Document Type":"Article","x":9.0083560944,"y":4.5113930702},{"Cluster":3,"DocId":589,"Cited by":51.0,"Title":"Land-use-change modeling using unbalanced support-vector machines","Author Keywords":null,"Abstract":"Modeling land-use change is a prerequisite to understanding the complexity of land-use-change patterns.
