[{"DocId":8,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Automatic Target Detection from Satellite Imagery Using Machine Learning","Abstract":"Object detection is a vital step in satellite imagery-based computer vision applications such as precision agriculture, urban planning and defense applications. In satellite imagery, object detection is a very complicated task due to various reasons including low pixel resolution of objects and detection of small objects in the large scale (a single satellite image taken by Digital Globe com-prises over 240 million pixels) satellite images. Object detection in satellite images has many challenges such as class variations, multiple objects pose, high variance in object size, illumination and a dense background. This study aims to compare the performance of existing deep learning algorithms for object detection in satellite imagery. We created the dataset of satellite imagery to perform object detection using convolutional neural network-based frameworks such as faster RCNN (faster region-based convolutional neural network), YOLO (you only look once), SSD (single-shot detector) and SIMRDWN (satellite imagery multiscale rapid detection with windowed networks). In addition to that, we also performed an analysis of these approaches in terms of accuracy and speed using the developed dataset of satellite imagery. The results showed that SIMRDWN has an accuracy of 97% on high-resolution images, while Faster RCNN has an accuracy of 95.31% on the standard resolution (1000 \u00d7 600). YOLOv3 has an accuracy of 94.20% on standard resolution (416 416) while on the other hand SSD has an accuracy of 84.61% on standard resolution (300 \u00d7 300). When it comes to speed and efficiency, YOLO is the obvious leader. In real-time surveillance, SIMRDWN fails. When YOLO takes 170 to 190 milliseconds to perform a task, SIMRDWN takes 5 to 103 milliseconds. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

population distributions","Abstract":"With an increasing global population, accurate and timely population counts are essential for urban planning and disaster management. Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (&lt;2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral sig-natures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R2 values up to 93%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84% of the out-of-sample variation for population density. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

imagery, such as that provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat satellites, has been widely used to study environmental protection, hazard analysis, and urban planning for decades. Clouds are a constant challenge for such imagery and, if not handled correctly, can cause a variety of issues for a wide range of remote sensing analyses. Typically, cloud mask algorithms use the entire image; in this study we present an ensemble of different pixel-based approaches to cloud pixel modeling. Based on four training subsets with a selection of different input features, 12 machine learning models were created. We evaluated these models using the cropped LC8-Biome cloud validation dataset. As a comparison, Fmask was also applied to the cropped scene Biome dataset. One goal of this research is to explore a machine learning modeling approach that uses as small a training data sample as possible but still provides an accurate model. Overall, the model trained on the sample subset (1.3% of the total training samples) that includes unsupervised Self-Organizing Map classification results as an input feature has the best performance. The approach achieves 98.57% overall accuracy, 1.18% cloud omission error, and 0.93% cloud commission error on the 88 cropped test images. By comparison to Fmask 4.0, this model improves the accuracy by 10.12% and reduces the cloud omission error by 6.39%. Furthermore, using an additional eight independent validation images that were not sampled in model training, the model trained on the second largest subset with an additional five features has the highest overall accuracy at 86.35%, with 12.48% cloud omission error and 7.96% cloud commission error. This model\u2019s overall correctness increased by 3.26%, and the cloud omission error decreased by 1.28% compared to Fmask 4.0. The machine learning cloud classification models discussed in this paper could achieve very good performance utilizing only a small portion of the total training pixels available. We showed that a pixel-based cloud classification model, and that as each scene obviously has unique spectral characteristics, and having a small portion of example pixels from each of the sub-regions in a scene can improve the model accuracy significantly. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

America","Abstract":"Urban land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of various land use types are critically important for urban planning, environmental management, disaster control, health protection, and biodiversity conservation. Recent advances in remote sensing and social sensing data and methods have shown great potentials in mapping urban land use categories, but they are still constrained by mixed land uses, limited predictors, non-localized models, and often relatively low accuracies. To inform these issues, we proposed a robust and cost-effective framework for mapping urban land use categories using openly available multi-source geospatial \u201cbig data\u201d. With street blocks generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the minimum classification unit, we integrated an expansive set of multi-scale spatially explicit information on land surface, vertical height, socio-economic attributes, social media, demography, and topography. We further proposed to apply the automatic ensemble learning that leverages a bunch of machine learning algorithms in deriving optimal urban land use classification maps. Results of block-level urban land use classification in five metropolitan areas of the United States found the overall accuracies of major-class (Level-I) and minor-class (Level-II) classification could be high as 91% and 86%, respectively. A multi-model comparison revealed that for urban land use classification with high-dimensional features, the multi-layer stacking ensemble models achieved better performance than base models such as random forest, extremely randomized trees, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks. We found without very-high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery, the classification results derived from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and other open big data based features could achieve plausible overall accuracies of Level-I and Level-II classification at 88% and 81%, respectively. We also found that model transferability depended highly on the heterogeneity in characteristics of different regions. The methods and findings in this study systematically elucidate the role of data sources, classification methods, and feature transferability in block-level land use classifications, which have important implications for mapping multi-scale essential urban land use categories. \u00a9 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

(LiDAR), an active remote sensing technology, is becoming an essential tool for geoinformation extraction and urban planning. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds segmentation and accurate classification are challenging and crucial to produce different geo-information products like three-dimensional (3D) city designs. This paper introduces an effective data-driven approach to build roof superstructures classification for airborne LiDAR point clouds with very low density and imbalanced classes, covering an urban area. Notably, it focuses on building roof superstructures (especially dormers and chimneys) and mitigating nonplanar objects' problems. Also, the imbalanced class problem of LiDAR data, to the best of our knowledge, is not yet addressed in the literature; it is considered in this study. The major advantage of the proposed approach is using only raw data without assumptions on the distribution underlying data. The main methodological novelties of this work are summarized in the following key elements. (i) At first, an adapted connected component analysis for 3D points cloud is proposed. (ii) Twelve geometry-based features are extracted for each component. (iii) A Support Vector Machine (SVM)-driven procedure is applied to classify the 3D components. (iv) Furthermore, a new component size-based sampling (CSBS) method is proposed to treat the imbalanced data problem and has been compared with several existing resampling strategies. In this study, components are classified into five classes: shed and gable dormers, chimneys, ground, and others. The results of this investigation show the satisfying classification performance of the proposed approach. Results also showed that the proposed approach outperformed machine learning methods, including SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Adaboost. \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"3D classification; imbalanced data; light detection and ranging (LiDAR); Low-density point cloud; roof superstructures","Authors":"Aissou B.E., Aissa A.B., Dairi A., Harrou F., Wichmann A., Kada M.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSEN.2021.3073535","Text":"Building Roof Superstructures Classification from Imbalanced and Low Density Airborne LiDAR Point Cloud.

In this purpose, remote sensing based on image classification approaches undergoing a high revolution can be dedicated to land cover mapping tasks. Similarly, deep learning models are considerably applied in remote sensing applications; which can automatically learn features from large amounts of data.

The aim of this study is to apply a new approach to analyse land cover, and extract its features. Experiments carried out on a coastal town located in north-western Algeria (T\u00e9n\u00e8s region). The study area is chosen because of its importance as a part of the national strategy to combat natural hazards, specifically floods. As well as, a simple CNN model with two hidden layers was constructed, combined with an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA). In this regard, a Sentinel-2 image was used, to perform the classification, using spectral index combinations. Furthermore, to compare the performance of the proposed approach, an OBIA based on machines learning algorithms mainly Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), was provided. Results of accuracy assessment of classification showed good values in terms of Overall accuracy and Kappa Index, which reach to 93.1% and 0.91, respectively. As a comparison, CNN-OBIA approach outperformed OBIA based on RF algorithm.

(LC) are two complementary pieces of cartographic information used for urban planning and environmental monitoring. In the context of New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot, the availability of up-to-date LULC maps is essential to monitor the impact of extreme events such as cyclones and human activities on the environment.

This work aims at determining the best current deep learning configuration (pixel-wise vs. semantic labelling architectures, data augmentation, image prepos-sessing, \u2026 ), to perform LULC mapping in a complex, subtropical environment. For this purpose, a specific data set based on SPOT6 satellite data was created and made available for the scientific community as an LULC benchmark in a tropical, complex environment using five representative areas of New Caledonia labelled by a human operator: four used as training sets, and the fifth as a test set. Several architectures were trained and the resulting classification was compared with a state-of-the-art machine learning technique: XGboost. We also assessed the relevance of popular neo-channels derived from the raw observations in the context of deep learning. The deep learning approach showed comparable results to XGboost for LC detection and over-performed it on the LU detection task (61.45% vs. 51.56% of overall accuracy). Finally, adding LC classification output of the dedicated deep learning architecture to the raw channels input significantly improved the overall accuracy of the deep learning LU classification task (63.61% of overall accuracy).

areas","Abstract":"Automatic detection of newly constructed building areas (NCBAs) plays an important role in addressing issues of ecological environment monitoring, urban management, and urban planning. Compared with low-and-middle resolution remote sensing images, high-resolution remote sensing images are superior in spatial resolution and display of refined spatial details. Yet its problems of spectral heterogeneity and complexity have impeded research of change detection for high-resolution remote sensing images. As generalized machine learning (including deep learning) technologies proceed, the efficiency and accuracy of recognition for ground-object in remote sensing have been substantially improved, providing a new solution for change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images. To this end, this study proposes a refined NCBAs detection method consisting of four parts based on generalized machine learning: (1) pre-processing; (2) candidate NCBAs are obtained by means of bi-temporal building masks acquired by deep learning semantic segmentation, and then registered one by one; (3) rules and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly adopted for classification of NCBAs with high, medium and low confidence; and (4) the final vectors of NCBAs are obtained by post-processing. In addition, area-based and pixel-based methods are adopted for accuracy assessment. Firstly, the proposed method is applied to three groups of GF1 images covering the urban fringe areas of Jinan, whose experimental results are divided into three categories: high, high-medium, and high-medium-low confidence. The results show that NCBAs of high confidence share the highest F1 score and the best overall effect. Therefore, only NCBAs of high confidence are considered to be the final detection result by this method. Specifically, in NCBAs detection for three groups GF1 images in Jinan, the mean Recall of area-based and pixel-based assessment methods reach around 77% and 91%, respectively, the mean Pixel Accuracy (PA) 88% and 92%, and the mean F1 82% and 91%, confirming the effectiveness of this method on GF1. Similarly, the proposed method is applied to two groups of ZY302 images in Xi\u2019an and Kunming. The scores of F1 for two groups of ZY302 images are also above 90% respectively, confirming the effectiveness of this method on ZY302. It can be concluded that adoption of area registration improves registration efficiency, and the joint use of prior rules and SVM classifier with probability features could avoid over and missing detection for NCBAs. In practical applications, this method is contributive to automatic NCBAs detection from high-resolution remote sensing images. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan.

Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is \u221215.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models.

The organization of human life activity requires solving the issues of urban planning and the correct distribution of zones for the construction of industrial facilities, recreation, waste disposal zones, communications, routes, etc. Balanced planning is based on monitoring the current state of infrastructure and territory. This article proposes a methodology for integrated monitoring of the development of urban and suburban areas. It is proposed to use Earth remote sensing data as a basis for the study.

a challenging task due to spectral and spatial diversity within an urban environment. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and small-sensor technology are rapidly evolving, presenting the opportunity for a comprehensive multi-sensor remote sensing approach for urban tree classification. The objectives of this paper were to develop a multi-sensor data fusion technique for urban tree species classification with limited training samples. To that end, UAV-based multispectral, hyperspectral, LiDAR, and thermal infrared imagery was collected over an urban study area to test the classification of 96 individual trees from seven species using a data fusion approach. Two supervised machine learning classifiers, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were investigated for their capacity to incorporate highly dimensional and diverse datasets from multiple sensors. When using hyperspectral-derived spectral features with RF, the fusion of all features extracted from all sensor types (spectral, LiDAR, thermal) achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (OA) of 83.3% and kappa of 0.80. Despite multispectral reflectance bands alone producing significantly lower OA of 55.2% compared to 70.2% with minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformed hyperspectral reflectance bands, the full dataset combination (spectral, LiDAR, thermal) with multispectral-derived spectral features achieved an OA of 81.3% and kappa of 0.77 using RF. Comparison of the features extracted from individual sensors for each species highlight the ability for each sensor to identify distinguishable characteristics between species to aid classification. The results demonstrate the potential for a high-resolution multi-sensor data fusion approach for classifying individual trees by species in a complex urban environment under limited sampling requirements. \u00a9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"Random Forest; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Machine; Tree Species Detection","Authors":"Hartling S., Sagan V., Maimaitijiang M.","DOI":"10.1080\/15481603.2021.1974275","Text":"Urban tree species classification using UAV-based multi-sensor data fusion and machine learning.

China in 2018","Abstract":"Mapping socio-economic indicators with a raster format is still a great challenge. The nighttime light (NTL) datasets have been widely utilized to estimate the socio-economic parameters. However, the precision of the published datasets was too coarse to meet related issues such as flood losses assessment, urban planning, and epidemiological studies. The present study calibrated gross domestic product (GDP), population (POP), electric consumption (EC), and urban build-up area (B-A) at 100 m resolution for 45 cities of China in 2018 using Luojia1-01 NTL datasets via random forest (RF) as well as geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The linear regression (LR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) methods were selected for comparison with GWR and RF models. Besides, the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) was chosen for comparison with Luojia1-01. The ten-folded cross-validation (CV) has been used for evaluating accuracy at county and city scales. Finally, the distribution maps of socio-economic parameters were illustrated and some findings were obtained. First, the validation results revealed that the calibration at the city-scale outperformed the county or district scale. Second, the precision of the Luojia1-01 NTL dataset surpassed the NPP-VIIRS NTL dataset on the same administrative scale except for some specific situations. Third, the precision of the simulation for the gross domestic product (GDP) is the highest than the others, followed by electric consumption (EC), build-up area (B-A), and population (POP). Fourth, the optimum model varied according to the socio-economic parameters. Fifth, the distribution of socio-economic parameters exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity.

inform urban planning and environmental research. Street view images (SVIs) have shown great potential for automated land-use classification for land-use mapping. However, previous studies overlooked SVI-derived location contextual information that may help improve land-use classification. This study proposes a novel land-use classification method that synthesizes location semantics from SVIs to account for contextual information from SVIs, land parcels and roads around the SVIs. The proposed method first generates land-use scene images (LUSIs) by using an SVI-derived straightforward algorithm. The LUSIs are then relocated to land parcels by using a displacement strategy and classified into land-use types by using a deep learning network. This study determines the land-use types of land parcels with classified LUSIs. Two case studies, consisting of LUSIs for five land-use types, show that introducing location semantics of SVIs can remarkably improve the classification accuracy of land-use types. \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"land-use classification; Land-use map; location semantics; street view image","Authors":"Fang F., Yu Y., Li S., Zuo Z., Liu Y., Wan B., Luo Z.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2020.1831515","Text":"Synthesizing location semantics from street view images to improve urban land-use classification.

found in many Asian cities. These villages contain many closely packed buildings constructed decades ago without proper urban planning. There is a need for those buildings to be identified and put into statistics. In this paper, we present a segmentation framework that invokes multiple machine learning techniques and point cloud\/image processing algorithms to segment individual closely packed buildings from large urban scenes. The presented framework consists of two major segmentation processes. The framework first filters out the non-ground objects from the point cloud, then it classified them by using the Random Forest classifier to isolate buildings from the entire scene. After that, the building point clouds will be segmented based on several building attribute analysis methods. This is followed by using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) plane filtering method to expand the space between two closely packed buildings, so that the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering technique can be used to more accurately segment each individual building from the closely packed building areas. Two airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets collected in two different cities with some typical closely packed buildings were used to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can effectively identify the closely packed buildings with unified structures from large airborne LiDAR datasets. The overall segmentation accuracy reaches 84% for the two datasets. The proposed framework can serve as a basis for analysis and segmentation of closely packed buildings with a more complicated structure. \u00a9 2020, \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Wang X., Chan T.O., Liu K., Pan J., Luo M., Li W., Wei C.","DOI":"10.1080\/01431161.2020.1727053","Text":"A robust segmentation framework for closely packed buildings from airborne LiDAR point clouds.

simulation","Abstract":"Urbanization processes have accelerated over recent decades, prompting efforts to model land use change (LUC) patterns for decision support and urban planning. Cellular automata (CA) are extensively employed given their simplicity, flexibility, and intuitiveness when simulating dynamic LUC. Previous research, however, has ignored the spatial heterogeneity among sub-regions, instead applying the same transition rules across entire regions; moreover, most existing methods extract neighborhood effects with only one data time slice, which is inconsistent with the nature of neighborhood interactions as a long-term process exhibiting obvious spatiotemporal dependency. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid cellular automata model coupling area partitioning and spatiotemporal neighborhood features learning, named PST-CA. We use a machine-learning-based partitioning strategy, self-organizing map (SOM), to divide entire regions into several homogeneous sub-regions, and further apply a spatiotemporal three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to extract the spatiotemporal neighborhood features. An artificial neural network (ANN) is then built to create a conversion probability map for each sub-region using both spatiotemporal neighborhood features and factors that drive the LUC. Finally, the dynamic simulation results of entire study area are generated by fusing these probability maps, constraints and stochastic factors. Land use data collected from 2000 to 2015 in Shanghai were selected to verify our proposed method. Four traditional models were implemented for comparison, including logistic regression (LR)-CA, support vector machine (SVM)-CA, random forest (RF)-CA and conventional ANN-CA. Results illustrate that the proposed PST-CA outperformed four traditional models, with overall accuracy increased by 4.66%~6.41%. Moreover, three distinctly different \u201ccoverage rate-growth rate\u201d composite patterns of built-up areas are shown in the SOM partitioning results, which verifies SOM's ability to address spatial heterogeneity; while the optimal time steps in 3D CNN generally maintained a positive correlation with the growth rate of built-up areas, which implies longer temporal dependency should be captured for rapidly developing areas. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Cellular automata; Land use; Neighborhood effects; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal features","Authors":"Qian Y., Xing W., Guan X., Yang T., Wu H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.137738","Text":"Coupling cellular automata with area partitioning and spatiotemporal convolution for dynamic land use change simulation.

been widely used in research on population spatialization. Previous studies have generally divided study areas into several sub-areas with similar features by artificial or clustering algorithms and then developed models for these sub-areas separately using statistical methods. These approaches have drawbacks due to their subjectivity and uncertainty. In this paper, we present a study of population spatialization in Beijing City, China based on multisource remote sensing data and town-level population census data. Six predictive algorithms were compared for estimating population using the spatial variables derived from The National Polar-Orbiting Partnership\/ Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP\/VIIRS) night-time light and other remote sensing data. Random forest achieved the highest accuracy and therefore was employed for population spatialization. Feature selection was performed to determine the optimal variable combinations for population modeling by random forest. Cross-validation results indicated that the developed model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2129.52 people\/km2 and a R2 of 0.63. The gridded population density in Beijing at a spatial resolution of 500 m produced by the random forest model was also adjusted to be consistent with the census population at the town scale. By comparison with Google Earth high-resolution images, the remotely-sensed population was qualitatively validated at the intra-town scale. Validation results indicated that remotely sensed results can effectively depict the spatial distribution of population within town-level districts. This study provides a valuable reference for urban planning, public health and disaster prevention in Beijing, and a reference for population mapping in other cities. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Beijing; Population spatialization; Random forest; Remote sensing","Authors":"He M., Xu Y., Li N.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12121910","Text":"Population spatialization in Beijing city based on machine learning and multisource remote sensing data.

land use is of great importance for urban planning, decision support, and resource allocation. The first mapping results of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) in China for 2018 have been recently released.

An object-based segmentation approach was first applied to generate the basic mapping units within urban parcels.

Random forest was adopted as the machine learning algorithm for classifying urban land use into five Level I classes and twelve Level II classes.

multi-spectral images is of great significance in precision agriculture, urban planning, land use and other fields. However, traditional remote sensing image classification methods cannot meet the classification accuracy requirements of UAV multi-spectral images. This paper aims to propose an object-based machine learning classification method to improve the land over classification accuracy of UAV multi-spectral images. The experimental area is a standard test field located in the Jilin Province of China. The experimental data was captured by a UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera which includes four bands from 550 nm to 790 nm. First, the original images were preprocessed and the spectral curves of land cover were analyzed, thus four kinds of land cover with large differences were selected as categories. Then pixel-based, boosting-based and object-based machine learning methods were used for classification. The object-based classification method could make full use of the spatial and spectral information, and eliminate the noise problem caused by the high resolution of the UAV image to a certain extent. Finally, accuracy analysis using the verification image showed that the RF-O method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 92.2419%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.8904. All results indicate that the object-based machine learning classification method proposed in this paper is more suitable for the research of land cover classification, comparing with the traditional remote sensing image classification methods, and performs well on the land cover classification of UAV multi-spectral images. \u00a9 2020 SPIE.","Author Keywords":"Image classification; Machine learning; UAV remote sensing","Authors":"Pan L., Gu L., Ren R., Yang S.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2566128","Text":"Land cover classification based on machine learning using UAV multi-spectral images.

last decade, Dubai emirate witnessed a vast, rapidly growing population, that doubled since 2008. Nowadays, Dubai considers as the most populated emirate within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With such an increasing population and new urban developments, sustainable urban planning procedures play an essential role in Dubai's environmental quality such as air quality, and pollution. Therefore, this study will utilize the Remote Sensing and Geographic Information system (GIS) to investigate Dubai's environmental quality by addressing and locating green areas and pollution percentages within each district. The study methodology is divided into three steps. First, Landsat Satellite medium spatial resolution and multi-spectral imagery will be used as an input for segmentation and object-based analysis. Considering the spectral and spatial signatures for green areas machine learning techniques will be adopted to select the most significant features to classify and extract green areas. Second, using environmental relational indices, green areas percentages will be quantitatively compared to Sentinel air quality data, such as NO2 and SO2, as well as the population density maps. Finally, GIS techniques will be used to create Dubai Environmental Critical Map (DECM), to locate districts with limited green areas and high pollution to improve environmental standards. The study results can be used as a measure for the municipality policymakers to ensure sustainable urban development for a healthy living. \u00a9 2020 SPIE","Author Keywords":"Dubai Environmental Vulnerability Map (DEVM); Geographic Information system (GIS); Remote Sensing","Authors":"Aldogom D., Mansoori S.A., AlMaazmi A., Nazzal T.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2573904","Text":"Remote sensing and GIS approach for environmental green areas planning using Landsat satellite imagery, Dubai-UAE.

This proposed method does not need to manually select training samples and other optimization steps, such as the nonroad area removing.

significant benefits for improving the sustainability and liveability of cities, but its monitoring is a major challenge for urban planners. Remote-sensing based technologies can effectively detect, monitor and quantify urban tree coverage as an alternative to field-based measurements. Automatic extraction of urban land cover features with high accuracy is a challenging task and it demands artificial intelligence workflows for efficiency and thematic quality. In this context, the objective of this research is to map urban tree coverage per cadastral parcel of Sandy Bay, Hobart from very high-resolution aerial orthophoto and LiDAR data using an Object Based Convolution Neural Network (CNN) approach. Instead of manual preparation of a large number of required training samples, automatically classified Object based image analysis (OBIA) output is used as an input samples to train CNN method. Also, CNN output is further refined and segmented using OBIA to assess the accuracy. The result shows 93.2% overall accuracy for refined CNN classification. Similarly, the overlay of improved CNN output with cadastral parcel layer shows that 21.5% of the study area is covered by trees. This research demonstrates that the accuracy of image classification can be improved by using a combination of OBIA and CNN methods. Such a combined method can be used where manual preparation of training samples for CNN is not preferred. Also, our results indicate that the technique can be implemented to calculate parcel level statistics for urban tree coverage that provides meaningful metrics to guide urban planning and land management practices. \u00a9 2019 Authors.","Author Keywords":"Cadastral Parcel; Convolutional Neural Network; GEOBIA; Machine Learning; Urban Trees","Authors":"Timilsina S., Sharma S.K., Aryal J.","DOI":"10.5194\/isprs-annals-IV-5-W2-111-2019","Text":"Mapping Urban Trees Within Cadastral Parcels Using an Object-Based Convolutional Neural Network.

3D point clouds are getting more and more frequently requested and used, not only for visualization needs but also e.g. by public administrations for urban planning and management. 3D point clouds are also a very frequent source for generating 3D city models which became recently more available for many applications, such as urban development plans, energy evaluation, navigation, visibility analysis and numerous other GIS studies. While the main data sources remained the same (namely aerial photogrammetry and LiDAR), the way these city models are generated have been evolving towards automation with different approaches. As most of these approaches are based on point clouds with proper semantic classes, our aim is to classify aerial point clouds into meaningful semantic classes, e.g. ground level objects (GLO, including roads and pavements), vegetation, buildings' facades and buildings' roofs. In this study we tested and evaluated various machine learning algorithms for classification, including three deep learning algorithms and one machine learning algorithm. In the experiments, several hand-crafted geometric features depending on the dataset are used and, unconventionally, these geometric features are used also for deep learning. \u00a9 2019 E. \u00d6zdemir et al.","Author Keywords":"Classification; Deep learning; Geometric features; Machine learning; Point cloud; Urban areas","Authors":"\u00d6zdemir E., Remondino F., Golkar A.","DOI":"10.5194\/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-843-2019","Text":"Aerial point cloud classification with deep learning and machine learning algorithms.

simulations and predictions of urban expansion are critical to manage urbanization and explicitly address the spatiotemporal trends and distributions of urban expansion. Cellular Automata integrated Markov Chain (CA-MC) is one of the most frequently used models for this purpose. However, the urban suitability index (USI) map produced from the conventional CA-MC is either affected by human bias or cannot accurately reflect the possible nonlinear relations between driving factors and urban expansion. To overcome these limitations, a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network, ANN) was integrated with CA-MC instead of the commonly used Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Logistic Regression (LR) CA-MC models. The ANN was optimized to create the USI map and then integrated with CA-MC to spatially allocate urban expansion cells. The validated results of kappa and fuzzy kappa simulation indicate that ANN-CA-MC outperformed other variously coupled CA-MC modelling approaches. Based on the ANN-CA-MC model, the urban area in South Auckland is predicted to expand to 1340.55\u00a0ha in 2026 at the expense of non-urban areas, mostly grassland and open-bare land.

imagery has many applications such as urban planning and vehicle navigation system. The common road extraction methods are based on classification algorithm, which needs to design robust handcrafted features for road. However, designing such features is difficult. For the road centerlines extraction problem, the existing algorithms have some limitations, such as spurs, time consuming. To address the above issues to some extent, we introduce the feature learning based on deep learning to extract robust features automatically, and present a method to extract road centerlines based on multiscale Gabor filters and multiple directional non-maximum suppression. The proposed algorithm consists of the following four steps. Firstly, the aerial imagery is classified by a pixel-wise classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, CNN is used to learn features from raw data automatically, especially the structural features. Then, edge-preserving filtering is conducted on the resulting classification map, with the original imagery serving as the guidance image. It is exploited to preserve the edges and the details of the road. After that, we do some post-processing based on shape features to extract more reliable roads. Finally, multiscale Gabor filters and multiple directional non-maximum suppression are integrated to get a complete and accurate road network. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve comparable or higher quantitative results, as well as more satisfactory visual performance. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Centerlines extraction; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Edge-preserving filtering; Multiscale Gabor filters","Authors":"Liu R., Miao Q., Song J., Quan Y., Li Y., Xu P., Dai J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.neucom.2018.10.036","Text":"Multiscale road centerlines extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery.

optical Sentinel images","Abstract":"Reliable and accurate land use\/land cover (LULC) map is a crucial data source for the understanding of coupled human-environment systems, monitoring changes, timely low-cost planning, and management of natural resources. Improvements in sensor technologies and machine learning capabilities have shifted the attention of remote sensing community to data complementarity through fusion of multi-sensor data for accurate feature extraction and mapping. Amalgamation of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has shown promising advantages in enhancing the accuracy of extracting LULC as such method allows exploitation of information in sensors. This study investigated the potential of using freely available multisource Sentinel images to extract LULC maps in semi-arid environments through multi-scale geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). A multi-scale classification framework that integrates GEOBIA, correlation-based feature selection (CFS), and random forest (RF)-supervised classification was adopted to extract LULC from assimilation of Sentinel multi-sensor products. First, Sentinel-1 and-2 images were pre-processed. Second, optimum multi-scale segmentation levels were selected using F-score segmentation quality measures. Third, 70 features of various spectral indices and derivatives and geometrical features from optical data and multiple ratios and textural features from dual-polarization SAR images were computed, and a CFS based on wrapper approach was used to select the most significant features at multi-scale levels. Finally, a single and multi-scale RF classifier was used to extract LULC classes using the most relevant features extracted from Sentinel SAR and optical images. Results of multi-scale image segmentation optimization showed that scale parameter (SP) values of 40, 60, and 150 were optimal for extraction of LULC classes. Results of feature selection showed that 22, 24, and 27 features were selected at scale SP values of 40, 60, and 150, respectively. Half of the features were common among the three scales. Single RF classification yielded overall accuracy (OA) values of 92.10%, 93%, and 91% and kappa coefficients of 0.901, 0.912, and 0.89 at scale values of 150, 60, and 40, respectively. Multiscale RF classification from scale values of 150 and 60 produced better LULC classification with OA 96.06% and kappa coefficient of 0.95 compared with other scale SP values. The integrated approach demonstrated an effective and promising method for high-quality LULC extraction from coupling optical and SAR images. Overall, multi-sensor Sentinel images along with the adopted approach feature a remarkable potential for improving LULC extraction and can effectively be used to update geographic information system layers for various applications. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.","Author Keywords":"data fusion; image segmentation optimization; LULC; object-based classification; Optical sensors; SAR","Authors":"Al-Ruzouq R., Shanableh A., Gibril M.B., Kalantar B.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2533123","Text":"Multi-scale correlation-based feature selection and random forest classification for LULC mapping from the integration of SAR and optical Sentinel images.

analysis","Abstract":"Hyperspectral image (HSI) has been used for a wide range of applications including forestry, urban planning, and precision agriculture. In recent years, machine learning based algorithms, such as support vector machines, decision trees, ensemble learning, and their variations have shown promising results in HSI analysis. Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to insufficient information abstraction in interpreting hyperspectral pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based classification algorithm, named Progressively Expanded Neural Network (PEN Net), that can effectively interpret hyperspectral pixels in nonlinear feature spaces and then determine their categories. Furthermore, a spectral-spatial HSI classification framework is also introduced to test the generality and robustness of the PEN Net. Experimental results on four standard hyperspectral datasets illustrate that: (1) PEN Net classifier yields better accuracy and competitive processing speed in HSI classification tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods; (2) Multi-hidden layer based PEN Net generally provides better performance than single hidden layer one; (3) Combination of spectral and spatial features in the PEN Net classifier can significantly improve the classification accuracy by 6\u201315% compared to the spectral only based HSI classification. This study implies that the proposed neural network architecture opens a new window for future research and the potential for remote sensing image analysis. \u00a9 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

may consider the application of remote sensing as a trade-off between the imaging platforms, sensors, and data gathering and processing techniques. This study addresses the potential of hyperspectral imaging using ultra-light aircraft for vegetation species mapping in an urban environment, exploring both the engineering and scientific aspects related to imaging platform design and image classification methods. An imaging system based on simultaneous use of Rikola frame format hyperspectral and Nikon D800E adopted colour infrared cameras installed onboard a Bekas X32 manned ultra-light aircraft is introduced. Two test imaging flight missions were conducted in July of 2015 and September of 2016 over a 4000 ha area in Kaunas City, Lithuania. Sixteen and 64 spectral bands in 2015 and 2016, respectively, in a spectral range of 500-900 nm were recorded with colour infrared images. Three research questions were explored assessing the identification of six deciduous tree species: (1) Pre-treatment of spectral features for classification, (2) testing five conventional machine learning classifiers, and (3) fusion of hyperspectral and colour infrared images. Classification performance was assessed by applying leave-one-out cross-validation at the individual crown level and using as a reference at least 100 field inventoried trees for each species. The best-performing classification algorithm-multilayer perceptron, using all spectral properties extracted from the hyperspectral images-resulted in a moderate classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy was 63%, Cohen's Kappa was 0.54, and the species-specific classification accuracies were in the range of 51-72%. Hyperspectral images resulted in significantly better tree species classification ability than the colour infrared images and simultaneous use of spectral properties extracted from hyperspectral and colour infrared images improved slightly the accuracy over the 2015 image. Even though classifications using hyperspectral data cubes of 64 bands resulted in relatively larger accuracies than with 16 bands, classification error matrices were not statistically different. Alternative imaging platforms (like an unmanned aerial vehicle and a Cessna 172 aircraft) and settings of the flights were discussed using simulated imaging projects assuming the same study area and field of application. Ultra-light aircraft-based hyperspectral and colour-infrared imaging was considered to be a technically and economically sound solution for urban green space inventories to facilitate tree mapping, characterization, and monitoring. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Classification; Colour infrared; Hyperspectral; Ultra-light aircraft; Urban trees","Authors":"Mozgeris G., Juodkiene V., Jonikavi\u010dius D., Straigyte L., Gadal S., Ouerghemmi W.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs10101668","Text":"Ultra-Light aircraft-based hyperspectral and colour-infrared imaging to identify deciduous tree species in an urban environment.

provide key information for a broad range of applications such as urban planning, urban management, and navigation. The fast-developing technology of remote sensing that acquires high-resolution observational data of the land surface offers opportunities for automatic extraction of road networks. However, the road networks extracted from remote sensing images are likely affected by shadows and trees, making the road map irregular and inaccurate. This research aims to improve the extraction of road centerlines using both very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by accounting for road connectivity. The proposed method first applies the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to segment remote sensing images into image objects and then classifies image objects using the machine learning classifier, random forest. A post-processing approach based on the minimum area bounding rectangle (MABR) is proposed and a structure feature index is adopted to obtain the complete road networks. Finally, a multistep approach, that is, morphology thinning, Harris corner detection, and least square fitting (MHL) approach, is designed to accurately extract the road centerlines from the complex road networks. The proposed method is applied to three datasets, including the New York dataset obtained from the object identification dataset, the Vaihingen dataset obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2D semantic labelling benchmark and Guangzhou dataset. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can obtain the highest completeness, correctness, and quality for the three datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is an efficient solution for extracting road centerlines in complex scenes from VHR aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"LiDAR data; Object recognition; Road centerline; Road connectivity; Very-high-resolution image","Authors":"Zhang Z., Zhang X., Sun Y., Zhang P.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs10081284","Text":"Road centerline extraction from very-high-resolution aerial image and LiDAR data based on road connectivity.

potential to obtain high-resolution aerial imagery at frequent intervals, making them a valuable tool for urban planners who require up-to-date basemaps. Supervised classification methods can be exploited to translate the UAV data into such basemaps. However, these methods require labeled training samples, the collection of which may be complex and time consuming. Existing spatial datasets can be exploited to provide the training labels, but these often contain errors due to differences in the date or resolution of the dataset from which these outdated labels were obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for updating basemaps using global and local contextual cues to automatically remove unreliable samples from the training set, and thereby, improve the classification accuracy. Using UAV datasets over Kigali, Rwanda, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we demonstrate how the amount of mislabeled training samples can be reduced by 44.1% and 35.5%, respectively, leading to a classification accuracy of 92.1% in Kigali and 91.3% in Dar es Salaam. To achieve the same accuracy in Dar es Salaam, between 50000 and 60000 manually labeled image segments would be needed. This demonstrates that the proposed approach of using outdated spatial data to provide labels and iteratively removing unreliable samples is a viable method for obtaining high classification accuracies while reducing the costly step of acquiring labeled training samples. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Basemap updating; image classification; informal settlements; label noise; random forests; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); urban planning","Authors":"Gevaert C.M., Persello C., Elberink S.O., Vosselman G., Sliuzas R.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2017.2762905","Text":"Context-Based Filtering of Noisy Labels for Automatic Basemap Updating from UAV Data.

city and the greenery coverage information is essential for land resource management, environmental monitoring and urban planning. It is a challenging work to extract the urban greenery information from remote sensing image as the trees and grassland are mixed with city built-ups. In this paper, we propose a new automatic pixel-based greenery extraction method using multispectral remote sensing images. The method includes three main steps. First, a small part of the images is manually interpreted to provide prior knowledge. Secondly, a five-layer neural network is trained and optimised with the manual extraction results, which are divided to serve as training samples, verification samples and testing samples. Lastly, the well-trained neural network will be applied to the unlabelled data to perform the greenery extraction. The GF-2 and GJ-1 high resolution multispectral remote sensing images were used to extract greenery coverage information in the built-up areas of city X. It shows a favourable performance in the 619 square kilometers areas. Also, when comparing with the traditional NDVI method, the proposed method gives a more accurate delineation of the greenery region. Due to the advantage of low computational load and high accuracy, it has a great potential for large area greenery auto extraction, which saves a lot of manpower and resources. \u00a9 Authors 2018.

SAR data from TerraSAR-X and ENVISAT ASAR in both WSM and IMP modes were used to be combined with optical data at pixel level, feature level and decision levels using four typical machine learning methods.

For instance, support vector machine was the most stable at both the feature and decision levels, while random forest was suitable at the pixel level but not suitable at the decision level. 3) By examining the distribution of SAR features, some features (e.g., homogeneity) exhibited a close-to-normal distribution, explaining the improvement from the maximum likelihood method at the feature and decision levels. This indicated the benefits of using texture features from SAR data when being combined with optical data for land cover classification.

areas such as robotics, urban planning and augmented reality. 3D sensors measure a high amount of points in the 3D scene objects' surface at a high collect rate, so robust techniques are needed to process all input data and also deal with some imprecision. A common solution for these tasks is the use of robust features extraction techniques to gather representative scene information at the lowest computational cost possible. This paper presents a new approach for object recognition in 3D scenes, using a novel 3D shape descriptor which is used as input for a supervised machine learning method. Proposed robust 3D feature is invariant to translation and scale and provides a very simplified object representation for pattern recognition input. Experiments were performed using an Artificial Neural Network to recognize six different object shapes, and obtained results showed that the proposed method is a promising approach for object recognition in 3D scenes. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"3D Feature Extraction; Object Classification; Pattern Recognition","Authors":"Sales D.O., Amaro J., Os\u00f3rio F.S.","DOI":"10.1109\/SBR-LARS-R.2017.8215285","Text":"3D shape descriptor for objects recognition. 3D point cloud classification is an important task in applications for many areas such as robotics, urban planning and augmented reality. 3D sensors measure a high amount of points in the 3D scene objects' surface at a high collect rate, so robust techniques are needed to process all input data and also deal with some imprecision.

radar (SAR) is an advanced earth observation system with day and night imaging capability, which can obtain rich information of terrain and has a wide range of applications in environmental

As the first selfdeveloped C-band multi-polarized SAR image, the acquisition of massive data and operational operation of Chinese SAR remote sensing has entered the era of big data.

At present, big data-based intelligent methods such as computer vision technology have achieved great success. Deep learning such as deep highway unit networks has revolutionized the computer vision area. However, due to the characteristics of SAR microwave band imaging and phase coherence processing, SAR images are very different from ordinary optical images in terms of band, projection direction, data composition and so on.

important for a variety of applications, especially city planning and natural disaster prediction and management. In recent years, extraction of urban structures from remotely sensed images has been extensively explored. The key advantages of this imaging modality are reduction of surveying expense and time. It also elevates restrictions on ground surveys. Thus far, much research typically extracts these structures from very high resolution satellite imagery, which are unfortunately of relatively poor spectral resolution, resulting in good precision yet moderate accuracy. Therefore, this paper investigates extraction of buildings from middle and high resolution satellite images by using spectral indices (Normalized Difference Building Index: NDBI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: NDVI, Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index: SAVI, Modified Normalized Difference Index: MNDWI, and Global Environment Monitoring Index: GEMI) by means of various Machine Learning methods (Artificial Neural Network: ANN, K-Nearest Neighbor: KNN, and Support Vector Machine: SVM) and Data Fusion (i.e., Majority Voting). Herein empirical results suggested that suitable learning methods for urban areas extraction are in preferring order Data Fusion, SVM, KNN, and ANN. Their accuracies were 85.46, 84.86, 84.66, and 84.91%, respectively. \u00a9 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Author Keywords":"data fusion; machine learning; spectral indices; urban areas extraction","Authors":"Puttinaovarat S., Horkaew P.","DOI":"10.1134\/S1054661816040131","Text":"Urban areas extraction from multi sensor data based on machine learning and data fusion.

Imagery","Abstract":"Water is one of the vital components for the ecological environment, which plays an important role in human survival and socioeconomic development. Water resources in urban areas are gradually decreasing due to the rapid urbanization, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the precise extraction and automatic identification of water bodies are of great significance and urgently required for urban planning. It should be noted that although some studies have been reported regarding the water-area extraction, to our knowledge, few papers concern the identification of urban water types (e.g., rivers, lakes, canals, and ponds). In this paper, a novel two-level machine-learning framework is proposed for identifying the water types from urban high-resolution remote-sensing images. The framework consists of two interpretation levels: 1) water bodies are extracted at the pixel level, where the water\/shadow\/vegetation indexes are considered and 2) water types are further identified at the object level, where a set of geometrical and textural features are used. Both levels employ machine learning for the image interpretation. The proposed framework is validated using the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 images, over two mega cities in China, i.e., Wuhan and Shenzhen, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved satisfactory accuracies for both water extraction [95.4% (Shenzhen), 96.2% (Wuhan)], and water type classification [94.1% (Shenzhen), 95.9% (Wuhan)] in complex urban areas. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"High resolution; machine learning; object-oriented; water detection; water extraction; water index","Authors":"Huang X., Xie C., Fang X., Zhang L.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2015.2420713","Text":"Combining Pixel-and Object-Based Machine Learning for Identification of Water-Body Types from Urban High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Imagery.

(LULC) mapping in urban areas is one of the core applications in remote sensing, and it plays an important role in modern urban planning and management. Deep learning is springing up in the field of machine learning recently. By mimicking the hierarchical structure of the human brain, deep learning can gradually extract features from lower level to higher level. The Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model is a widely investigated and deployed deep learning architecture. It combines the advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning and can archive good classification performance. This study proposes a classification approach based on the DBN model for detailed urban mapping using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. Through the DBN model, effective contextual mapping features can be automatically extracted from the PolSAR data to improve the classification performance. Two-date high-resolution RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data over the Great Toronto Area were used for evaluation. Comparisons with the support vector machine (SVM), conventional neural networks (NN), and stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) were conducted to assess the potential of the DBN-based classification approach.

adaptive data reduction for the classification of 3D point clouds acquired from a Riegl Terrestrial laser scanner. The training and inference of the acquired large outdoor urban data can be time consuming. We approach the problem by computing an adaptive support region for each data point using 3D scale theory. For training and inference of the discriminative Conditional Random Fields, smaller set of data samples that contains relevant information within the support region is selected instead of using all point cloud data. We tested the algorithm on synthetically generated data and urban point clouds data acquired from the laser scanner. The computed support region is also used in feature extraction for urban point clouds data. The results showed improvement in the training and inference rate while maintaining comparable classification accuracy. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Classifications; Conditional random fields; LIDAR data; Machine learning; Scale theory","Authors":"Lim E.H., Suter D.","DOI":"10.1109\/CW.2007.24","Text":"Conditional random field for 3D point clouds with adaptive data reduction.
