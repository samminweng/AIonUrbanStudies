Generalized adversarial networks (GANs) will be utilized to predict the future urban growth of Doha Metropolitan emerging city. The housing dispersal of expatriates will be visualized on the predicted urban growth map to investigate housing preferences, which will be based on Gordon's theory. This study will prove the feasibility of a process approach when practicing the management of urban growth in emerging cities worldwide. It could be a robust solution for the worsening imbalance in the urban morphology of metropolitan cities.

Algorithms","Abstract":"Green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, is now widely used in sustainable urban development. An accurate mapping of GI is important to provide surface parameterization for model development. However, the accuracy and precision of mapping GI is still a challenge in identifying GI at the small catchment scale. We proposed a framework for blue-green-gray infrastructure classification using machine learning algorithms and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that contained digital surface model (DSM) information. We used the campus of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, as a study case for our classification method. The UAV was a DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral, which measures the blue, green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared bands and DSM information. Six machine learning algorithms, i.e., fuzzy classifier, k-nearest neighbor classifier, Bayes classifier, classification and regression tree, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were used to classify blue (including water), green (including green roofs, grass, trees (shrubs), bare land), and gray (including buildings, roads) infrastructure. The highest kappa coefficient was observed for RF and the lowest was observed for SVM, with coefficients of 0.807 and 0.381, respectively. We optimized the sampling method based on a chessboard grid and got the optimal sampling interval of 11.6\u00a0m to increase the classification efficiency. We also analyzed the effects of weather conditions, seasons, and different image layers, and found that images in overcast days or winter days could improve the classification accuracy. In particular, the DSM layer was crucial for distinguishing green roofs and grass, and buildings and roads. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using UAV images in urban blue-green-gray infrastructure classification, and our infrastructure classification framework based on machine learning algorithms is effective. Our results could provide the basis for the future urban stormwater management model development and aid sustainable urban planning.

China","Abstract":"The significant economic development witnessed in China in recent decades has been accompanied by the increasing expansion of urban areas. Although a growing literature has analyzed the characteristics and driving forces of urban land expansion, less attention has been paid to examining the different expansion determinants driving fine-scale urban land use (residential land, administration and public services land, commercial land, and industrial land) change. This paper aims to identify the differences of multi-mechanisms driving fine-scale urban land use expansion based on big data and machine learning, in the Huizhou downtown area in 2000\u20132015. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to identify the natural, transportation, location, social, and POI factors driving land expansion by considering different urban land-use categories. Our RF estimations showed that enormous differences existed between various urban land-use types in terms of the role they played in this expansion and their relation to potential determinants, during the different urban development stages studied. Transportation, location, and the distribution of actual land use were found to exert a greater influence on urban land expansion than other factors. All the findings above provide detailed spatiotemporal knowledge and targeted information that can aid in understanding fine-scale urban land use dynamics. In this way, sound planning strategies for different fine-scale land uses can be formulated more scientifically. The strength of association between these factors and urban land expansion differed greatly depending on the different land-use types involved as well as the urban development stage that it occurred within. These results cast a new light on the importance of investigating the potential driving forces in the expansion of different urban land-use types. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Big data; Driving forces; Fine-scale; Huizhou; Random Forest; Urban land use","Authors":"Wu R., Wang J., Zhang D., Wang S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2021.103202","Text":"Identifying different types of urban land use dynamics using Point-of-interest (POI) and Random Forest algorithm: The case of Huizhou, China.

fine-scale spatiotemporal distribution of residential land prices (RLPs) is the basis for scientifically allocating land resources, managing the residential market and improving urban planning. The accurate mapping of the RLP dynamics require reliable land price prediction models and data with fine spatial and temporal resolution. With the aid of point of interest (POI) data and nighttime light (NTL) images, this paper attempts to explore the ability of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to model grid-level RLPs using the case of Wuhan in China. Several land price prediction models were built using five MLAs and various geographic variables. The experimental results show that the extra-trees regression algorithm and the radial basis function-based support vector regression algorithm perform best in Period \u2160 (2010\u20132014) and Period \u2161 (2015\u20132019), respectively; therefore, they were selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids without observations in the corresponding period. Based on the estimated results, we found that the spatial pattern of the RLP in Wuhan transitioned from monocentric to polycentric between the two periods, and RLPs grew rapidly near newly formed urban subcenters and waterscapes. The relative importance of the predictor variables shows that commercial and educational facilities are important determinants of the RLP distribution in Wuhan; moreover, the relative importance of natural amenities and education facilities increased over time, while that of commercial facilities and public transportation decreased slightly. The case of Wuhan confirms the feasibility of MLAs and openly accessible urban data in modeling fine-scale RLP distributions. Our proposed framework provides a new approach to monitor the urban land price dynamics accurately and closely, which is beneficial for improving the infrastructure layout and achieve smart city growth. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Determinants; Land price distribution; Machine learning; Open data; Spatiotemporal variation; Wuhan","Authors":"Zhang P., Hu S., Li W., Zhang C., Yang S., Qu S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apgeog.2021.102442","Text":"Modeling fine-scale residential land price distribution: An experimental study using open data and machine learning.

approach","Abstract":"Urban development pattern significantly impacts stream water quality by influencing pollutant generation, build-up, and wash-off processes. It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3\u2212-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3\u2212-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Scenario planning; Urban form; Urban sprawl; Water quality","Authors":"Wang R., Kim J.-H., Li M.-H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.144057","Text":"Predicting stream water quality under different urban development pattern scenarios with an interpretable machine learning approach.

land use change is a current challenge for environmental management world-wide. Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004\u20132019) from fused image-ries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Im-ager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use\/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local au-thorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

analysing urban expansion and population growth and their link to the consumption of construction materials by combining satellite data with material consumption analysis within the Hanoi Province (Vietnam). Urban expansion is investigated with the use of landcover maps for the period 1975\u20132020 derived from satellite. During this period, artificial surfaces and agricultural areas have increased by 11.6% and 15.5%, re-spectively, while forests have decreased by 26.7%. We have used publicly available datasets to calculate and forecast the construction materials consumption and measure its statistical correla-tion with urban expansion between 2007 and 2018. Our results show that official figures for sand consumption are currently underestimated, and that by 2030, steel and sand and gravel consumption will increase even further by three and two times, respectively. Our analysis uses a new method to assess urban development and associated impacts by combining socio-economic and Earth Observation datasets. The analysis can provide evidence, underpin decision-making by au-thorities, policymakers, urban planners and sustainability experts, as well as support the development of informed strategies for resource consumption. It can also provide important information for identifying areas of land conservation and ecological greenways during urban planning. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Spatio-temporal contextual information derived from multitemporal high-resolution imagery is useful for highlighting urban land cover changes. This article proposes a new method for detecting urban built-up area change from multitemporal high spatial resolution imagery by combining spectral and spatio-temporal features. A multiband temporal texture measured using pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV) is adopted to quantify the local spatio-temporal dependence between bitemporal multispectral images. The PCMV textures at multiple scales, bitemporal spectral features, and normalized difference vegetation indices are together input to an improved one-class random forest classifier for urban built-up area change mapping. The proposed method is evaluated in urban built-up area change detection using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images of Tianjin area acquired from 2015 to 2019. It is also compared with three feature combinations and an existing postclassification comparison method based on one-class support vector machine. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed the traditional ones, with increases of 2.15%-7.38%, 2.07%-5.45%, 1.93%-6.76%, and 5.98%-13.11% in overall accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method also achieves the best performance using the bitemporal Sentinel-2 images over the east of Beijing area.

Governorate, Iraq","Abstract":"High rate of urbanization coupled with population growth has led to unexpected land use and land cover changes in Hilla city, which is located in the Babylon governorate of Iraq. Understanding and quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban land use and land cover changes, as well as the driving factors behind them, are therefore vital in order to design appropriate policies and monitoring mechanisms to govern urban growth. This study analyzes land use and land cover changes over Hilla city through remote sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques. IKONOS satellite imagery from years 2000, 2005, and 2011 was collected and pre-processed using ENVI and ArcGIS, which then goes through an object-based supervised image classification stage to generate land use and land cover maps. The classification is performed using the statistical machine learning algorithm, SVM (Support Vector Machine). The confusion matrix and kappa coefficients are used to evaluate the overall accuracy of the results. The statistical results obtained enable assessment of class changes from years 2000 to 2011 and also identify the gain and loss of the built-up areas in relation to other land cover classes. The results also allow assessment of the spatial trend of these built-up areas. Ultimately, forecasts can be made to predict expected future class changes in 2026 and 2036. Generally, the results of this study show increased expansions of built-up areas, i.e., from 8.14% in 2000 to 14.53% in 2005 and up to 18.36% in 2011. All this was at the expense of bare land areas. Simultaneously, there was an increased expansion of vegetation\/agricultural land area, specifically from 36.14% in 2000 to 41.71% in 2005 and 45.13% in 2011. The spatial trend also shows that the growth of built-up areas is focused in the southwestern part of Hilla city. In all, we foresee that the findings of this study can provide a good visual resource for decision-makers to perform more efficient urban planning. \u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Built-up areas; Land use dynamics; Spatial trend; Support vector machine; Urbanization","Authors":"Mahmoud A.S., Kalantar B., Al-Najjar H.A.H., Moayedi H., Halin A.A., Mansor S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-71945-6_3","Text":"Object-Oriented Approach for Urbanization Growth by Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques: A Case Study in Hilla City, Babylon Governorate, Iraq.

A machine learning segmentation procedure was used to obtain the data on the occurrence of built-up areas. Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explain spatially varying impact of factors related to population, spatial and economic development, and living standards on the share of built-up areas in the area of small cities. Significant association was found between the population density and the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities studied. The influence of the other socio-economic factors examined, related to the spatial and economic development of the cities and the quality of life of the inhabitants, showed great regional variation.

information systems, and remote sensing data, urban growth modeling has become a viable tool for predicting urbanization of cities and towns, regions, and nations around the world. This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, urban growth models often discard the spatiotemporal uncertainties in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyzed the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on a widely applied cellular automata model known as the SLEUTH CA and the other one based on a previously published machine learning framework. We selected these two models because they are complementary, the first is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the second is more data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori knowledge or bias. To test our methodology, we chose the cities of Jiaxing and Lishui in China because they are representative of new town planning policies and have different characteristics in terms of land extension, geographical conditions, growth rates, and economic drivers. We focused on the spatiotemporal uncertainty, understood as the inherent doubt in the predictions of where and when will a piece of land become urban, using the concepts of certainty area in space and certainty area in time. The proposed analyses in this paper aim to contribute to better urban planning exercises, and they can be extended to other cities worldwide. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale.

Municipality","Abstract":"Population growth coupled with economic, housing and environmental factors have significantly contributed into accelerated land use change in the New Juaben Municipality of Ghana. These factors have caused destruction of natural habitat and increased natural hazards such as flooding in the Municipality. Monitoring land use\/land cover change is essential in respect to the dynamics of both human and natural factors that affect the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land surface. This research investigates the transitions among the major land use\/land cover categories in the Municipality as a highly populated urban region that is facing some environmental challenges such as deforestation and degradation of the environment. Random Forest was adopted for the classification of 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 land cover maps while the analysis of the dynamics was conducted using intensity analysis. The unique contribution of this article is the combine usage of machine learning algorithm and intensity analysis to assess the changes in land use\/land cover. The results showed that 1985\u20131991 and 2002\u20132015 periods experience fast change and the land use transformation has been accelerating over the whole period. The major changes were caused by the Built-up and Agricultural activities constituting 21.24 % and 13.19 % respectively in the category level. It is recommended that, authorities should consider several structural transformation measures within Ghana, including inter-sectoral land use harmonization policies (e.g. the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act 2016), land use planning and legal reforms to help address the underlying drivers of urban led deforestation. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Ghana; Intensity analysis; Random forest classification; UN sustainable development goals; Urbanization","Authors":"Nyamekye C., Kwofie S., Ghansah B., Agyapong E., Boamah L.A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2020.105057","Text":"Assessing urban growth in Ghana using machine learning and intensity analysis: A case study of the New Juaben Municipality.

countries (LICs) lives in fragile and conflict-affected states. Many cities in these states show high growth dynamics, but little is known about the relation of conflicts and urban growth. In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime, which lasted from 1996 to 2001, caused large scale displacement of the population. People from Afghanistan migrated to neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan, and all developments came to a halt. After the US invasion in October 2001, all the major cities in Afghanistan experienced significant population growth, in particular, driven by the influx of internally displaced persons. Maximum pressure of this influx was felt by the capital city, Kabul. This rapid urbanization, combined with very limited capacity of local authorities to deal with this growth, led to unplanned urbanization and challenges for urban planning and management. This study analyses the patterns of growth between 2001 and 2017, and the factors influencing the growth in the city of Kabul with the help of high-resolution Earth Observation-based data (EO) and spatial logistic regression modelling. We analyze settlement patterns by extracting image features from high-resolution images (aerial photographs of 2017) and terrain features as input to a random forest classifier. The urban growth is analyzed using an available built-up map (extracted from IKONOS images for the year 2001). Results indicate that unplanned settlements have grown 4.5 times during this period, whereas planned settlements have grown only 1.25 times. The unplanned settlements expanded mostly towards the west and north west parts of the city, and the growth of planned settlements happened mainly in the central and eastern parts of the city. Population density and the locations of military bases are the most important factors that influence the growth, of both planned and unplanned settlements. The growth of unplanned settlement occurs predominantly in areas of steeper slopes on the hillside, while planned settlements are on gentle slopes and closer to the institutional areas (central and eastern parts of the city). We conclude that security and availability of infrastructure were the main drivers of growth for planned settlements, whereas unplanned growth, mainly on hillsides, was driven by the availability of land with poor infrastructure. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

are a few of many puzzling factors affecting our future cities. Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions. This will play a vital role in sustaining Jordan's food security. \u00a9 2020Environmental science, Computer science, Geography, Land use planning, Land use change, Urban growth, Machine learning, Urban planning, Modeling; Artificial intelligence, Cellular Automata, Markov Chain. \u00a9 2020","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Cellular Automata; Computer science; Environmental science; Geography; Land use change; Land use planning; Machine learning; Markov Chain; Modeling; Urban growth; Urban planning","Authors":"Gharaibeh A., Shaamala A., Obeidat R., Al-Kofahi S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.heliyon.2020.e05092","Text":"Improving land-use change modeling by integrating ANN with Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model.

systems, as they prevent soil erosion, retain water by increased infiltration, and act as a buffer zone between rivers and their surroundings. Within urban spaces, these areas have also an important role in preventing illegal occupation in areas of hydrologic risk, such as in floodplains. The goal of this research is to propose a framework for identifying areas of permanent protection associated with perennial drainage, utilizing satellite imagery and digital elevation models (DEM) in association with machine learning techniques. The specific objectives include the development of a decision tree to retrieve perennial drainage over high resolution, 1-meter DEM's, and the development of digital image processing workflow to retrieve surface water bodies from Sentinel-2 imagery. In-situ information on perennial and ephemeral conditions of streams and rivers were obtained to validate our results, that happened in the first trimester of 2020. We propose a minimum of 7 days without precipitation prior to in-situ validation, for more accurate assessment of streamflow conditions, in order to minimize impacts of surface water runoff in flow regime. The proposed method will benefit decision makers by providing them with reliable information on drainage network and their buffer zones, as well as yield detailed mapping of the areas of permanent protection that are key to urban planning and management. \u00a9 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","Author Keywords":"Digital Elevation Models; Machine Learning; Perennial Drainage; Riparian Vegetation; Sentinel-2","Authors":"Montibeller A., Vilela M., Hino F., Mallmann P., Nadas M., Caruso F., Delabary H.","DOI":"10.5194\/isprs-archives-XLIII-B3-2020-161-2020","Text":"On the development of a novel approach for identifying perennial drainage in Southern Brazil: A study case integrating sentinel-2 and high-resolution digital elevation models with machine learning techniques.

green vegetation in urban areas using remote sensing techniques can be used as a tool for integrated spatial planning to deal with urban challenges. In this context, multitemporal (MT) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have not been equally investigated, as compared to optical satellite data. This research compared various machine learning methods using single-date and MT Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery. The research was focused on vegetation mapping in urban areas across Europe. Urban vegetation was classified using six classifiers-random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost. M1 (AB), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Whereas, SVM showed the best performance in the single-date image analysis, the MLP classifier yielded the highest overall accuracy in the MT classification scenario. Mean overall accuracy (OA) values for all machine learning methods increased from 57% to 77% with speckle filtering. Using MT SAR data, i.e., three and five S1 imagery, an additional increase in the OA of 8.59% and 13.66% occurred, respectively. Additionally, using three and five S1 imagery for classification, the F1 measure for forest and low vegetation land-cover class exceeded 90%. This research allowed us to confirm the possibility of MT C-band SAR imagery for urban vegetation mapping. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Land-cover classification; Multitemporal; Sentinel-1; Speckle filtering; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Urban vegetation","Authors":"Ga\u0161parovi\u0107 M., Dobrini\u0107 D.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12121952","Text":"Comparative assessment of machine learning methods for urban vegetation mapping using multitemporal Sentinel-1 imagery.

Shenzhen, China","Abstract":"A forward-looking urban land use plan is crucial to a city's sustainability, which requires a deep understanding of human-environment interactions between different domains, and modelling them soundly. One of the key challenges of modelling these interactions is to understand and model how human individuals make and develop their location decisions by learning that then shape urban land-use patterns. To investigate this issue, we have constructed an extended experience-weighted attraction learning model to represent the human agents\u2019 learning when they make location decisions. Consequently, we propose and have developed an agent-based learning-embedded model (ABM-learning) for residential land growth simulation that incorporates a learning model, a decision-making model, a land use conversion model and the constraint of urban land use master plan. The proposed model was used for a simulation of the residential land growth in Shenzhen city, China. By validating the model against empirical data, the results showed that the site-specific accuracy of the model has been improved when embedding learning model. The analysis on the simulation accuracies has proved the argument that modelling individual-level learning matters in the agent's decision model and the agent-based models. We also applied the model to predict residential land growth in Shenzhen from 2015 to 2035, and the result can be a reference for land-use allocation in detailed planning of Shenzhen. The ABM-learning is applicable to studying the past urban growth trajectory, aiding in the formulation of detailed residential land and public service facility planning and assessing the land use planning effectiveness. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"ABM-learning; Agent-Based modelling; Experience-Weighted attraction learning model; Residential land growth; Shenzhen city","Authors":"Li F., Li Z., Chen H., Chen Z., Li M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2020.104620","Text":"An agent-based learning-embedded model (ABM-learning) for urban land use planning: A case study of residential land growth simulation in Shenzhen, China.

management.

temporal lengths of newly emerged data sets (e.g., data sets of social media, mobile phones, and smart cards) obstruct the effective analysis of long-term dynamics of landuse patterns, particularly in small and developing cities. This study proposed a framework to delineate and analyze mixed land-use patterns and their evolution using municipal water consumption data. A two-step classification strategy was designed based on the rotation forest scheme to differentiate the socioeconomic types of customers (e.g., residence, commerce, public facility, manufacturing, and recreation) using multiple features extracted from the various forms of water consumption time series. The spatial distributions of the socioeconomic functions were then derived, and the mixed land use was measured using a diversity index based on information entropy. Such an approach was applied to Changshu, a typical developing county-level city in China, for the period 2004 to 2013. The results showed that the urbanization of Changshu experienced both spatial expansion and intensification, with a slightly declining rate of growth in recent years. Apart from the city center, two subcenters have emerged for industrial development. The degree of land-use mixture has increased with urban growth, indicating a maturing of urbanization. This study explored the approach of identifying individual socioeconomic functions by the consumption patterns of municipal services and demonstrated that municipal service data sets can reveal land-use patterns and dynamics at a fine spatial resolution to evaluate urban planning and management, with the advantages of large population coverage and long-term temporal lengths. \u00a9 2020, \u00a9 2020 by American Association of Geographers.","Author Keywords":"land-use patterns; mixed land use; municipal water consumption; rotation forest; social sensing","Authors":"Guan Q., Cheng S., Pan Y., Yao Y., Zeng W.","DOI":"10.1080\/24694452.2020.1769463","Text":"Sensing Mixed Urban Land-Use Patterns Using Municipal Water Consumption Time Series.

urban planning and management. This article proposes a machine learning, hierarchical object-based method to map slum settlements using very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and land boundary data to support slum upgrading. The proposed method is tested in Kingston Metropolitan Area, Jamaica. First, the VHR imagery is classified into major land cover classes (i.e., the initial land cover map). Second, the VHR imagery and land boundary layer are used to obtain homogenous neighborhoods (HNs). Third, the initial land cover map is used to derive multiple context, spectral, and texture image features according to the local physical characteristics of slum settlements. Fourth, a machine-learning classifier, classification and regression trees, is used to classify HNs into slum and nonslum settlements using only the effective image features. Finally, reference data collected manually are used to assess the accuracy of the classification. In the training site, an overall accuracy of 0.935 is achieved. The effective image indicators for slum mapping include the building layout, building density, building roof characteristics, and distance from buildings to gullies. The classifier and those features selected from the training site are further used to map slums in two validating sites to assess the transferability of our approach. Overall accuracy of the two validating sites reached 0.928 and 0.929, respectively, suggesting that the features and classification model obtained from one site has the potential to be transferred to other areas in Jamaica and possibly other developing Caribbean countries with similar situation and data availability. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Classification and regression trees (CART); Jamaica; object-oriented classification; slum settlements; very high-resolution (VHR) image","Authors":"Williams T.K.-A., Wei T., Zhu X.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2019.2954407","Text":"Mapping Urban Slum Settlements Using Very High-Resolution Imagery and Land Boundary Data.

This has led to accelerating urbanization which requires proper planning and monitoring. As the urban areas are expanding, urban slum areas are also increasing along with it. These growing urban slum areas require proper observation so that existing resources can be employed to provide these regions with the best possible livelihood conditions. For this purpose, urban slum areas as well as surrounding land resources should be well identified and classified so that the existing land resources can be appropriately utilized for future implementation of development activities. Machine learning classification algorithms are found to be very suitable for the identification and classification of remotely sensed images.

In this study, our major objective is to identify and classify different land cover zones in the urban slums areas of Chingrajpara area of Chhattisgarh using remotely-sensed images. For this purpose, high-resolution images, collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are used and these images are classified into different land cover features using two different machine learning algorithms Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF).

Therefore, this study developed a machine learning-based method to compare the distributions of building heights in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two cities with different development patterns. First, we collected detailed information on the buildings, such as the location and land values. Second, the height of each building was simulated based on the above information using the well-known random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and artificial neural network. The random forests algorithm outperformed the other two in both cities. We also found that the commercial land value is the most important factor associated with building heights. Moreover, the building heights in Guangzhou are more sensitive to the distances to administrative centers, while the distances to transportation networks exert stronger influences on the building heights in Shenzhen.

structure is a key component to understand the complexity of urban systems because it provides a snapshot of urban dynamics and how people use space. This paper integrates socially sensed activity data with a remotely sensed land cover product in order to infer urban land use and its changes over time. We conducted a case study in theWashington D.C.-Baltimore metropolitan area to identify the pattern of land use change from undeveloped to developed land, including residential and non-residential uses for a period covering 1986-2008. The proposed approach modeled physical and behavioral features of land parcels from a satellite-based impervious surface cover change product and georeferenced Tweets, respectively. A model assessment with random forests classifiers showed that the proposed classification workflow could classify residential and non-residential land uses at an accuracy of 81%, 4% better than modeling the same land uses from physical features alone. Using the timestamps of the impervious surface cover change product, the study also reconstructed the timeline of the identified land uses. The results indicated that the proposed approach was capable of mapping detailed land use and change in an urban region, and represents a new and viable way forward for urban land use surveying that could be especially useful for surveying and tracking changes in cities where traditional approaches and mapping products (i.e., from remote sensing products) may have a limited capacity to capture change. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Activity patterns; Land use; Machine learning; Social sensing; Twitter","Authors":"Fu C., Song X.-P., Stewart K.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11242965","Text":"Integrating activity-based geographic information and long-term remote sensing to characterize urban land use change.

sustainable development","Abstract":"The Nile Delta of Egypt is increasingly facing sustainability threats, due to a combination of nature- and human-induced changes in land cover and land use. In this paper, an analysis of big time series data from remotely sensed satellite images and the random forests classifier was undertaken to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of urbanization and cropland in the Nile Delta between 2007 and 2017. Out of thirteen variables, five spectral indices were chosen to build 500 decision trees, with a resulting overall accuracy average of 91.9 \u00b1 1.5%. The results revealed that the urban extent in the Nile Delta has increased, between 2007 and 2017, by 592.4 km2 (1.92%). Particularly, the results indicated that the years 2011 and 2012, which coincided the 2011 political uprising in Egypt, so-called the Arab Spring, were associated with significant land-use changes in the Nile Delta, both in rate and scale. As a result, the cropland area in the region decreased between 2010 and 2011 by 1.63% (502.21 km2). Moreover, the results showed that during the period 2012\u20132017, the mean annual urbanization rate in the region stood at 60 km2\/year. In contrast, croplands decreased during the same period at an average annual rate of 2 km2\/year. At the governorates\u2019 level, the results suggested that top agricultural producing governorates in the Nile Delta, such as Elmonoufia, Elkalubia, Elbouhyra, and Elghrbia, witnessed the highest rates of decrease in cropland areas during the period 2012\u20132017. Over the same period, urban areas increased the most in Elkalubia, Domiate, and Elmonoufia by 1.98%, 1.72%, and 1.34%, respectively.

vitally important for sustainable urban development and the well-being of urban residents. However, there is, as yet, no country-level urban forest spatial dataset of sufficient quality for the scientific management of, and correlative studies on, urban forests in China. At present, China attaches great importance to the construction of urban forests, and it is necessary to map a high-resolution and high-accuracy dataset of urban forests in China. The open-access Sentinel images and the Google Earth Engine platform provide a significant opportunity for the realization of this work. This study used eight bands (B2-B8, B11) and three indices of Sentinel-2 in 2016 to map the urban forests of China using the Random Forest machine learning algorithms at the pixel scale with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The 7317 sample points for training and testing were collected from field visits and very high resolution images from Google Earth. The overall accuracy, producer's accuracy of urban forest, and user's accuracy of urban forest assessed by independent validation samples in this study were 92.30%, 92.27%, and 92.18%, respectively. In 2016, the percentage of urban forest cover was 19.2%. Nearly half of the cities had an urban forest cover between 10% and 20%, and the average percentage of large cities whose urban populations were over 5 million was 24.8%. Cities with less than half of the average were mainly distributed in northern and western parts of China, which should be focused on in urban greening planning. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"China; Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2; Urban area; Urban greening","Authors":"Duan Q., Tan M., Guo Y., Wang X., Xin L.","DOI":"10.3390\/f10090729","Text":"Understanding the spatial distribution of urban forests in China using Sentinel-2 images with Google Earth Engine.

of annual land use change is crucial to timely assessment of the impacts of land use policies, especially in rapidly urbanizing areas such as the Liangjiang New District of Chongqing, China. This research aims to assess the impacts of multi-level land use policies and plans and their effectiveness in protecting farmland, and to recommend policies to remedy defective ones. Markov Chain\u2013Cellular Automata modelling was integrated with machine learning to predict future urbanization. The results show that prior to the establishment of the District in late 2010, the urban area grew at 13% annually because local policies promoted profit-motivated development. This rate declined drastically to 4% during 2011\u20132012 in direct response to the changed local land use policies and strict enforcement of national policies. These policies stabilized the urbanization rate at 7% over the subsequent years. The safeguard of previous farmland was possible only when the national policies were aligned closely with the local policies in their aim, provided both were rigorously enforced through a land management agency. Urban land in 2020 is predicted to growth by at least 464 km2 with some differences between two scenarios. In the baseline scenario (no change in policies), almost 70% of new growth will take place inside three industry zones and the duty-free ports. However, in the national overall plan scenario, a significant amount of marginal farmland will be changed into greenfields within the planned urban zones. It is recommended that a hierarchical farmland protection policy be implemented. It should incorporate the national policies that must be adapted to the local settings to achieve sustainable urbanization and to minimize farmland loss. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural network; Land use change; Land use policies and plans; Markov Chain \u2013 Cellular Automata (MC-CA); Rapid urbanization; Spatiotemporal analysis","Authors":"Xu T., Gao J., Li Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2019.104030","Text":"Machine learning-assisted evaluation of land use policies and plans in a rapidly urbanizing district in Chongqing, China.

This study evaluated both artificial neural network (ANN)and adaptive, network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)algorithms in conjunction with statistical modelling to predict green or grey transformation likelihoods for derelict sites (DS)and vacant sites along waterway corridors (WWC)in Manchester based on ecological, environmental, and social criteria.

City initiative will involve widespread installation of new stormwater infrastructure including green roofs, permeable pavements and rain gardens in at least 30 cities.

The main objective of this paper is to analyze the historical and future modeled LULC changes using multi-temporal Landsat images in the Upper Awash basin, Ethiopia. The supervised image classification method was used to determine the historical LULC changes based on Landsat 1 MSS 1972, Landsat 5 TM 1984, Landsat 7 ETM + 2000, and Landsat 8 OLI TIRS 2014. The future LULC change was predicted using the machine-learning approaches of Land Change Modeler (LCM). The LULC change detection analysis exhibited significant increment in the areal extent of the cropland and urban areas, and decreasing trends in the pasture, forests and shrubland coverage. Mainly, the LULC change matrices indicated that larger conversion rate was observed from shrubland to cropland area. The urban area found to increase by 606.2% from the year 1972 to 2014 and cropland has also increased by 47.3%. Whereas, a decreasing trend was obtained in the forest by \u2212\u00a025.1%, pasture \u2212 87.4%, shrubland \u2212 28.8% and water \u2212 21.0% in the same period. The modeled future LULC change scenarios of the year 2025 and 2035 have exhibited significant expansion of cropland and urban areas at the expense of forest, pasture and shrubland areas.

classification and change detection analysis based on remote sensing images using machine learning algorithm has become one of the important factors for environmental management and urban planning. We select Yangon as the study area because the government faces many problems in urban planning sectors due to the population growth and urban sprawl. Therefore, the proposed method aims to perform the land cover classification in Yangon using Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and post-classification change detection between 1987 and 2017 with 5 years interval periods are evaluated. Despite land cover classifications using satellite imagery have been executed in the past decades, the classification of remotely sensed data integrating with multiple spectral, temporal and textural features and processing time for classification using time series data still have limitations. To overcome these limitations, features extracted from Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Landsat-7, Landsat-5 and Open Street Map (OSM) are executed for classification and cloud-based GEE platform is used to reduce the processing time. Some spectral indexes such as NDVI, NDBI and slope from SRTM are calculated to achieve better classification. Land cover classification is performed by using the RF classifier with the different bands' combination. Land cover classification map with 7 classes (Shrub Land, Bare Land, Forest, Vegetation, Urban Area, Lake and River) is obtained with the overall accuracy of 96.73% and kappa statistic of 0.95 for 2017. Finally, change detection analysis over 30 years is performed and the significant changes in build-up, bare land, and agriculture have been resulted. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.","Author Keywords":"Change detection; Classification; Google Earth Engine; Land cover; Machine learning; Random forest","Authors":"Soe Thwal N., Ishikawa T., Watanabe H.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2532988","Text":"Land cover classification and change detection analysis of multispectral satellite images using machine learning.

method (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) was integrated with an explorative model, to study the feasibility of using machine learning to reduce the exploration time but providing the same support in long-term water system adaptation planning. The specific network structure and training pattern were determined through a comprehensive statistical trial-and-error (considering the distribution of errors). The network was applied to the case study in Scotchman's Creek, Melbourne. The network was trained with the first 10% of the exploration data, validated with the following 5% and tested on the rest. The overall root-mean-square-error between the entire observed data and the predicted data is 10.5722, slightly higher than the validation result (9.7961), suggesting that the proposed trial-and-error method is reliable. The designed MLP showed good performance dealing with spatial randomness from decentralized strategies. The adoption of MLP-supported planning may overestimate the performance of candidate urban water systems. By adopting the safety coefficient, a multiplicator or exponent calculated by observed data and predicted data in the validation process, the overestimation problem can be controlled in an acceptable range and have few impacts on final decision making. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Adaptation planning; Artificial neural network; Multi-layer perception; Urban planning; Water infrastructure","Authors":"Zhang J., Fu D., Urich C., Singh R.P.","DOI":"10.3390\/su10124600","Text":"Accelerated exploration for long-term urban water infrastructure planning through machine learning.

District in central China","Abstract":"Numerous machine learning-based land change models have been presented by researchers over the last two decades. To date, however, far less have simulated multiple land use classes and specific land use subclasses at the same time. In some areas of the world, it is important to simulate both of these dynamics to understand fully the drivers and consequences of land change. One important example is the process of urbanization in China, as urban policies have been developed that guide urban expansion, rural protections, and urban subclass development. This paper presents a new model integrating geographic information systems (GIS) with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict multiple transitions among land use types and urban subclasses in the Zhanggong District of Ganzhou city in China. We show that the model produces satisfactory goodness of fit values-based on location, quantity and spatial configuration-between simulated and observed land use maps for 2015. Our simulated future maps produced by the model for 2020 and 2025 demonstrate that transitions from farmland and forest to urban will remain the main pathway of urbanization although we predict that the rate will slow after 2025. The goals of urban planning should be aligned with land use planning according to \u201cCombining multiple laws and regulations\u201d in China. Taking into account the current and future land use transitions will enhance the accuracy and timeliness of land use policy making and urban land planning. For the sustainable land use in Zhanggong District, we argue for a strengthened regulation of the land market by government and believe that planning officials should guide the spatial distribution of land supply actively. Furthermore, improving the production, living and ecological functions of land resources are the key points to optimize urban land use functions and the allocation of land resources. We discuss how our model can be adapted to other areas to benefit land use management and urban planning in China. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural networks; China; Land use management; Multiple land use transitions; Urban planning; Urbanization","Authors":"Wang L., Pijanowski B., Yang W., Zhai R., Omrani H., Li K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2018.08.007","Text":"Predicting multiple land use transitions under rapid urbanization and implications for land management and urban planning: The case of Zhanggong District in central China.

gradually accelerated urbanization process, simulating and predicting the future pattern of the city is of great importance to the prediction and prevention of some environmental, economic and urban issues. Previous studies have generally integrated traditional machine learning with cellular automaton (CA) models to simulate urban development. Nevertheless, difficulties still exist in the process of obtaining more accurate results with CA models; such difficulties are mainly due to the insufficient consideration of neighborhood effects during urban transition rule mining. In this paper, we used an effective deep learning method, named convolution neural network for united mining (UMCNN), to solve the problem. UMCNN has substantial potential to get neighborhood information from its receptive field. Thus, a novel CA model coupled with UMCNN and Markov chain was designed to improve the performance of simulating urban expansion processes. Choosing the Pearl River Delta of China as the study area, we excavate the driving factors and the transformational relations revealed by the urban land-use patterns in 2000, 2005 and 2010 and further simulate the urban expansion status in 2020 and 2030. Additionally, three traditional machine-learning-based CA models (LR, ANN and RFA) are built to attest the practicality of the proposed model. In the comparison, the proposed method reaches the highest simulation accuracy and landscape index similarity. The predicted urban expansion results reveal that the economy will continue to be the primary factor in the study area from 2010 to 2030. The proposed model can serve as guidance in urban planning and government decision-making. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"cellular automata; deep learning; large scale; Markov chain; Urban expansion","Authors":"He J., Li X., Yao Y., Hong Y., Jinbao Z.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2018.1480783","Text":"Mining transition rules of cellular automata for simulating urban expansion by using the deep learning techniques.

classifier","Abstract":"Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Forest-a non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km2 in 1972 to 378 km2 in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Ensemble classifier; Greater Dhaka; Land cover change; Random forest; Remote sensing; Urban growth","Authors":"Hassan M.M., Southworth J.","DOI":"10.3390\/su10010010","Text":"Analyzing land cover change and urban growth trajectories of the mega-urban region of Dhaka using remotely sensed data and an ensemble classifier.

integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework","Abstract":"Cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used by researchers over the last three decades to simulate land-use change (LUC). While conventional CA and ANN models assign a cell to only one land-use class, in reality, a cell may belong to several land-use classes simultaneously. The recently developed multi-label (ML) concept overcomes this limitation in land change science. Although the ML concept is a new paradigm with nonexclusive classes and has shown considerable merit in several applications, few studies in land change science have applied it. In addition, determining transition rules in conventional CA is difficult when the number of drivers is large. Since CA has been shown as a potential model to consider neighborhood effects and ANN has been shown effective in determining CA transition rules, we integrated both CA with an ANN model to overcome limitations of each tool. In this study, we specifically extended the ANN-based Land Transformation Model (LTM) with both a CA-based model and the ML concept to create an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework. We also compared, using standard evaluation measures, differences between the proposed integrated model with a conventional CA-based LTM model (called the ml-CA-LTM). Parameterization was made using a learning and testing procedure common in machine learning. Results showed that the modified LUC model, ML-CA-LTM, produced consistently better goodness of fit calibration values compared to the ml-CA-LTM. The outcome of this modified model can be used by managers and decision makers for improved urban planning. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"arti\ufb01cial neural networks; cellular automata; land-use change; mono-label class; multi-label classes","Authors":"Omrani H., Tayyebi A., Pijanowski B.","DOI":"10.1080\/15481603.2016.1265706","Text":"Integrating the multi-label land-use concept and cellular automata with the artificial neural network-based Land Transformation Model: an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework.

imagery","Abstract":"Frequent human activity and rapid urbanization have led to an assortment of environmental issues. Monitoring land-cover change is critical to efficient environmental management and urban planning. The current study had two objectives. The first was to compare pixel-based random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifier methods and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm both in pixel-based and object-based approaches for classification of land-cover in a heterogeneous landscape for 2010. The second was to examine spatio-temporal land-cover change over the last two decades (1990\u20132010) using Landsat data. This study found that the object-based SVM classifier is the most accurate with an overall classification accuracy of 93.54% and a kappa value of 0.88. A post-classification change detection algorithm was used to determine the trend of change between land-cover classes. The most significant change from 1990 to 2010 was caused by the expansion of built-up areas. In addition to the net changes, the rate of annual change for each phenomenon was calculated to obtain a better understanding of the process of change. Between 1990 and 2010, an average of 4.53% of lands turned to the built-up annually and there was an annual decrease of about 0.81% in natural land. If the current trend of change continues, regardless of the actions of sustainable development, drastic declines in natural areas will ensue. The results of this study can be a valuable baseline for land-cover managers in the region to better understand the current situation and adopt appropriate strategies for management of land-cover. \u00a9 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Author Keywords":"Decision tree; Land-cover; Object-based; Random forest; Support vector machines","Authors":"Keshtkar H., Voigt W., Alizadeh E.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12517-017-2899-y","Text":"Land-cover classification and analysis of change using machine-learning classifiers and multi-temporal remote sensing imagery.

urban hydrologic modeling and urban land use mapping. In this study, an urban land cover dataset received from the database of UCI (University of California at Irvine) machine learning was used as the urban land cover data. This dataset is the urban area located in Deerfield Beach, FL, USA. Separately, this dataset is a high definition atmospheric image consisting of 9 different urban land covers. The characteristics of a multi-scale spectral, magnitude and formal tectology were used to sort out and classify these different images. The dataset comprises a total of 147 features and land covers of 9 different areas involving trees, grass, soil, concrete, asphalt, buildings, cars, pools and shadows. A new data weighting method was recommended to classify these 9 different patterns automatically. This recommended data weighting method is based on the combination of the measures of central tendency composed of mean value, harmonic value, mode and median along with the k-means clustering method. In the data weighting method, the data sets belonging to each class within the dataset are first calculated by using k-means clustering method, after which the measures of central tendency belonging to each class are calculated, as well. The measure of central tendency belonging to each class is divided by the set central value belonging to the class in question, as the result of which the data weight coefficient of that class has already been calculated. This calculation process is performed separately for 9 different land covers, and afterwards, these data weighting coefficients found are multiplied by the dataset, and thus, the dataset has been weighted. In the second stage, on the other hand, 3 different classification algorithms containing k-NN (k-nearest neighbor), extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to classify 9 different urban land covers after the data weighting method. In determining the educational and test data sets, the 10-fold cross validation was used. When classification through raw data was performed along with k-NN (for k = 1), ELM and SVM classification algorithms, the overall classification accuracy obtained was 77.15%, 84.70% and 84.79%, respectively. When classification through data weighting method (the combination of k-means clustering and mode measure) along with k-NN (for k = 1), ELM and SVM classification algorithms was made, the overall classification accuracy obtained proved to be 98.58%, 98.62% and 98.77%, respectively. The obtained results suggest that the urban land cover in an atmospheric image via the recommended data weighting method was classified as 9 different areas with a high classification success rate. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

study","Abstract":"The majority of cities are rapidly growing. This makes the monitoring and modeling of urban change\u2019s spatial patterns critical to urban planners, decision makers, and environment protection activists. Although a wide range of methods exists for modeling and simulating urban growth, machine learning (ML) techniques have received less attention despite their potential for producing highly accurate predictions of future urban extents. The aim of this study is to investigate two ML techniques, namely radial basis function network (RBFN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, for modeling urban change. By predicting urban change for 2010, the models\u2019 performance is evaluated by comparing results with a reference map and by using a set of pertinent statistical measures, such as average spatial distance deviation and figure of merit. The application of these techniques employs the case study area of Mumbai, India. The results show that both models, which were tested using the same explanatory variables, produced promising results in terms of predicting the size and extent of future urban areas. Although a close match between RBFN and MLP is observed, RBFN demonstrates higher spatial accuracy of prediction. Accordingly, RBFN was utilized to simulate urban change for 2020 and 2030. Overall, the study provides evidence that RBFN is a robust and efficient ML technique and can therefore be recommended for land use change modeling. \u00a9 2015, \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"GIS; multi-layer perceptron network; radial basis function network; spatial accuracy assessment; urban change","Authors":"Shafizadeh-Moghadam H., Hagenauer J., Farajzadeh M., Helbich M.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2014.993989","Text":"Performance analysis of radial basis function networks and multi-layer perceptron networks in modeling urban change: a case study.

areas offer great recreational and economic opportunities, but require intensive resource management and environmental protection. Land use and land cover information provides a rapid and cost-effective means for monitoring and planning coastal area development. This study quantitatively describes spatiotemporal changes of land use and land cover over the last four decades in a coastal area of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Historical aerial photographs from 1976 and satellite images from 1990 and 2012 were classified and analyzed. We used supervised classification and machine learning techniques to classify the images. An accuracy assessment of results was performed. Land use change statistics for the period indicate that urban areas have increased to the detriment of dense vegetation, salines, and bare soil.

Many researches focused on this issue in recent years. Driving forces are the core topic in urban expansion,as well as the basic component of modeling and predicting. It is very useful and meaningful to analyze the driving force of urban expansion, which may provide us with a scientific basis to rationally utilize land resources, determining the law of urban development, researching the evolution process, predicting the urban expansion trends, and also providing guidance for the development of rational control policies. The Shenyang city was chosen as study area. Eight categories of land use types were extracted from remote sensing images (1997 and 2010) with ArcGIS software. Ten driving forces were chosen, including three natural factors, three distance factors, four social and economic factors. which were calculated based on the land use maps, DEM, topographic maps, zoning maps and the statistical yearbooks. The dependent variable was the change of built-up area of Shenyang from 1997 to 2010. Boosted regression trees (BRT) is an ensemble method and is a combination of techniques between statistical and machine learning traditions that has shown to be effective to identify relationships between results and influencing factors. Logistic regression is a method to discover the empirical relationships between a binary dependent and several independent categorical and continuous variables. Boosted Regression Trees and Logistic regression were used to analyze the main driving force of urban expansion synthetically. The result illustrated the relative influence of driving factors was followed by distance from urban area of 1997, distance from river, DEM, distance from highway and railway, land use types, development plan, GDP, population density, aspect, and slope based on BRT analysis. According to Logistic regression analysis, the relative influence of important factors was followed by development zone, distance from urban land of 1997, DEM, distance from highway and railway, population density, distance from river, rural residential areas and slope. The most important driving forces affecting the expansion of Shenyang are distance from urban area of 1997, DEM, distance from highway and railway. Meanwhile, they were all located in the top four of the main factors. The results revealed that the distance factors were the most important factors, and the total contribution rate of relative influence was up to 61.4%. It is demonstrated distance factors are the main driving forces of urban expansion. Natural factorswere less important, but the relative influence of DEM was important, and the contribution rate was 12.5%. Development zones and rural settlements are the only two factors have much influence in the socio-economic factors. On the whole, location factors, which refer to the distance from urban land in this study, were the leading factors of urban expansion. Natural factors, such as DEM, rivers and so on, are the basis of urban development, determining the overall urban spatial form.

Although the urban growth in Athens can be mostly attributed to the expansion of the residential areas, the total coverage by impervious surfaces in the city has been significantly increased during the last decade due to construction and new development projects that took place during the preparation period of the 2004 Olympic Games. In this study, a 20-year Landsat imagery archive (1988-2007) was used to map the dynamics of urban growth in greater Athens area, based on the urbanization rates. The characterization and quantification of urban land-cover changes was performed by applying urban feature extraction techniques based on machine learning classifiers. Such classifiers use inductive learning algorithms to generate production rules from training data. For results validation, remote sensing data of higher spatial resolution than Landsat were used, i.e. Ikonosand ASTER (Advanced Specaborn Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images of the greater Athens agglomeration acquired between 2001 and 2007. The validation procedure involved a set of randomly selected points and overall accuracy of 94.8, 93.3 and 95.9 % for the years 2007, 2004 and 2001, respectively, was observed. Analysis of the results revealed continuing growth of urban features in the study area, particularly in the Messogia plain, where the new international airport of El. Venizelos is located, as well as in the western parts of greater Athens, across the Thriassion industrial area. Growth rate of urban areas was found to be variable in time, obtaining its maximum between 2000 and 2004, as expected.

In remote sensing research, the process of creating an accurate land cover map is an important subject. Recently, there has been growing research interest in the object-oriented image classification techniques. The object-oriented image classification consists of multidimensional features including object features and thus requires multi-dimensional image classification approaches. For example, a linear model such as the maximum likelihood method of pixel-based classification cannot characterize the patterns or relations of multi-dimensional data. In multi-dimensional image classification, data mining and ensemble learning have been shown to increase accuracy and flexibility. This study examined the use of the object-oriented image classification by the multiple machine learning algorithms for land cover mapping. We applied four classifiers: Classification and regression tree (CART), Decision tree with Boosting, Decision tree with Bagging, and Random Forest. The study area was Sado Island in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Pan-sharpened SPOT\/HRG imagery (June 2007) was used and classified into the following eight classes: broad-leaved deciduous forest, Japanese cedar, Japanese red pine, bamboo forest, paddy field, urban area, road, and bare land. We prepared four data sets with the object based features including textural information. The number of features is increased from data set I through IV. As the result, CART was unsuitable for multi-dimensional classification. Random Forest and Decision tree with Boosting showed high classification accuracies. Furthermore, in the data set with the limited features, Decision tree with Boosting was the accurate classifier. Finally, we propose two machine learning algorithms to every datasets.

approach","Abstract":"Given the pace and scale of urban expansion in many parts of the globe, urban environments are playing an increasingly important role in daily quality-of-life issues, ecological processes, climate, material flows, and land transformations. Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor rates and patterns of urban expansion, but many early challenges - such as distinguishing new urban land from bare ground - remain unsolved. To deal with the high temporal and spatial variability as well as complex, multi-signature classes within settlements, this paper presents a new approach that exploits multi-seasonal information in dense time stacks of Landsat imagery using a multi-date composite change detection technique. The central premise of the approach is that lands within\/near urban areas have distinct temporal trajectories both before and after change occurs, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in several spectral regions. The method relies on a supervised classification that exploits training data of stable\/changed areas interpreted from Google Earth images, and a 'brute force' approach of providing all available Landsat data as input, including scenes with data gaps due to the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) problem. Three classification algorithms (maximum likelihood, boosted decision trees, and support vector machines) were tested for their ability to monitor expansion across five time periods (1988-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009) in three study areas that differ in size, eco-climatic conditions, and rates\/patterns of development. Both the decision trees and support vector machines outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier (overall accuracy of 90-93%, compared to 65%), but the decision trees were superior at handling missing data. Adding transformed features such as band metrics to the Landsat data stack increased accuracy 1-4%, while experiments with a reduced number of features (designed to mimic noisy or missing data) led to a drop in accuracy of 1-9%. The methodology also proved particularly effective for monitoring peri-urbanization outside the urban core, capturing > 98% of village settlements. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Author Keywords":"Change detection; Cities; Classification; Decision trees; Environment; Land cover; Machine learning; Peri-urban; Random forests; Support vector machines; Urban areas; Urbanization","Authors":"Schneider A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.rse.2012.06.006","Text":"Monitoring land cover change in urban and peri-urban areas using dense time stacks of Landsat satellite data and a data mining approach.

This paper presents a novel method to model urban land-use change using support-vector machines (SVMs), a new generation of machine learning algorithms used in classification and regression domains. An SVM modeling framework has been developed to analyze land-use change in relation to various factors such as population, distance to roads and facilities, and surrounding land use. As land-use data are generally unbalanced, in the sense that the unchanged data overwhelm the changed data, traditional methods are incapable of classifying relatively minor land-use changes with high accuracy.
