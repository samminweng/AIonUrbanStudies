Prior studies mainly present the street quality using objective indicators like tree counts and distance to parks with land use data, or most recently using the greenery view index extracted from street view imagery (SVI). We argue objective indicators cannot completely describe people's sense of a place, as perception is a highly subjective process. We hypothesize that subjective measures using visual surveys could capture more subtle human perceptions, thus providing stronger predictive power to housing prices. However, the role of subjectively measured street design qualities is less known due to the lack of large-scale perception data. To test our hypothesis, we first collected designers\u2019 perceptions on five urban design qualities from pairwise SVIs rankings in Shanghai with an online visual survey. Unlike the mainstream of using generic image features, we followed urban design theory and used rule-based features, i.e., about thirty streetscape elements extracted from SVIs to train machine learning (ML) models to predict subjective perceptions. The predictive power of five qualities versus ten selected individual streetscapes on housing price were compared using the hedonic price model. Besides the standard ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were also developed to account for the spatial dependence and heterogeneity effects. We found both subjectively measured design qualities and objective indicators outperformed housing structural attributes in explaining housing price. While the objective view indexes collectively explained more price variances, the five perceptions individually exhibited stronger strength. Third, less-studied perceptions like \u201chuman scale\u201d showed stronger strength than commonly studied \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cenclosure\u201d. Fourth, less-studied view indexes like \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cfence\u201d outperformed ubiquitous features like trees and buildings. Lastly, prior studies might have resulted in biased estimations due to ignoring the multicollinear issues between the sky, tree and building views. Our study addressed the effectiveness of incorporating subjective perceptions at a micro level to infer housing prices. correlations between subjective perceptions were strong while that of objective indicators were negligible, therefore subjective perceptions can complement the objective indicators. The findings provide important reference to decision makers when selecting street quality indicators to infer urban design, city planning and community and housing development plans. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Human Perception; Property value; Street design qualities; Street view imagery; Subjective measures","Authors":"Qiu W., Zhang Z., Liu X., Li W., Li X., Xu X., Huang X.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2022.104358","x":12.3400001526,"y":1.3999999762},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":31,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Quantifying physical and psychological perceptions of urban scenes using deep learning","Abstract":"The complicated relationship between urban scenes and public perceptions has long been a concern in many disciplines. Previous studies have lacked human-oriented technical paths and high-throughput datasets to quantify physical and psychological perceptions in different land-use scenarios. This paper adopts a novel transfer learning approach to quantify the six types of landsense indices (LSIs) as psychological perception metrics and employs panoptic segmentation to parameterize the view index (VI) and the number of foreground instances (NFIs) as physical perception measures. Then, a quantitative analysis is conducted in Beijing's six Ring Road areas, and the connections between people's physical and psychological perceptions of heterogeneous land use are explored. The landsense maps can depict the distribution of LSIs and facilitate the understanding of complex perceptions distributed at a large scale. The regression model shows that natural landscapes (trees, grasses, and mountains) in the Beijing built-up area exhibit an overall positive performance. Moreover, for several block-level land uses, industrial scenery is related to overall negative psychological feelings. Parks and green spaces are positively related to psychological perceptions, because of the greater exposure opportunities to natural landscapes for residents. The framework in this research has potential in assisting urban planning and land-use management, and it enriches the datasets with extensive information, thereby improving the psychological perceptions of urban scenes from residents\u2019 perspectives. The novel approaches in this paper take a step forward in quantifying and understanding the public perceptions of urban landscapes. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Cityscapes; Complex perceptions; Deep learning; Human-oriented; Image big data; Massive street-view datasets","Authors":"Zhang Y., Li S., Dong R., Deng H., Fu X., Wang C., Yu T., Jia T., Zhao J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2021.105762","x":12.1300001144,"y":0.75},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":35,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Mapping fine-scale visual quality distribution inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR data","Abstract":"The visual quality of urban streets is of vital importance for establishing a satisfying and comfortable experience for the residents in an urban community. It also has positive effects on urban vibrancy, public health, and social connections in that community. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the visual quality at the urban street level using street view images. However, the spatial distribution of fine-grained visual quality inside an urban street is rarely investigated. This study presents a new approach for the evaluation of visual quality inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR point clouds. The semantic information of urban streets was first extracted from mobile LiDAR point clouds with a Gradient Boosting classifier. After that, seven well-known key design elements, including the green space factor, sky view factor, enclosure rate, volume index, vehicle occurrence rate, motorization rate, and diversity, were calculated from the classified point clouds using a three-dimensional (3D) visibility model. Finally, the visual quality at 1 m grid resolution inside urban street was achieved automatically by using a random forest model which was trained based on perception samples. This approach has been validated on two study areas and the results indicated that the proposed approach is able to quantitatively examine the visual quality difference inside urban streets. The results generated by the proposed method also match well with the common sense of urban design experts, which are useful for architects and designers to develop best practices in the urban micro-renewal project and to refine the urban planning processes. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Fine-scale; Machine learning; Mobile LiDAR; Urban street; Visual quality","Authors":"Wu B., Yu B., Shu S., Liang H., Zhao Y., Wu J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.108323","x":10.6000003815,"y":1.9500000477},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":48,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Assessing bikeability with street view imagery and computer vision","Abstract":"Studies evaluating bikeability usually compute spatial indicators shaping cycling conditions and conflate them in a quantitative index. Much research involves site visits or conventional geospatial approaches, and few studies have leveraged street view imagery (SVI) for conducting virtual audits. These have assessed a limited range of aspects, and not all have been automated using computer vision (CV). Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability and potentially can be used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining both SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a contribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to assess cycling appeal widely. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Bicycles; Deep learning; GIS; Google Street View; OpenStreetMap; Urban planning","Authors":"Ito K., Biljecki F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.trc.2021.103371","x":11.4499998093,"y":2.1700000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":49,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Modeling pedestrian emotion in high-density cities using visual exposure and machine learning: Tracking real-time physiology and psychology in Hong Kong","Abstract":"People's mental health has been deteriorating as a result of urban living, which also causes disability, pain, or even death among metropolitan residents. Understanding the interaction between human emotions and the built environment is therefore essential for developing strategies towards a psychologically friendly and socially resilient environment. This study aims to model the pedestrian emotion in high-density urban areas of Hong Kong using machine learning based on environmental visual exposure, which is one of the most significant factors affecting emotions. Using ambulatory sensing and portable technologies, two-dimensional emotional data from 99 pedestrians are retrieved from coupled data with respect to wearable arousal, subjective report preference, and the location at a high spatiotemporal resolution (4 m). The visual environment is quantified by isovist and street view factors. This study examines the impact of visual exposures using two multiple linear regression (MLR) models and establishes a predictive model using random forest (RF) (N = 548). The MLR models have R2 values around 0.5 and suggest that in the high-density environment, exposure to more trees, visual volume, and drift magnitude can cause positive emotions. Conversely, areas with a view of sign symbols, object proportion, min-radial, and occlusivity can cause negative emotions. The resultant predictive model with nine visual exposure variables can explain 79% of the spatial variance of pedestrian emotion. Furthermore, the methodological framework provides opportunities for spatial, data-driven approaches to portable sensing and urban planning research. The findings are also applicable to optimize the infrastructure design of outdoor environments for more psychologically friendly experiences. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Ambulatory pedestrian emotion track; Deep learning; Environment perception; Isovist; Random forest; Street view","Authors":"Xiang L., Cai M., Ren C., Ng E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.108273","x":12.6199998856,"y":-0.8600000143},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":51,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review","Abstract":"Street view imagery has rapidly ascended as an important data source for geospatial data collection and urban analytics, deriving insights and supporting informed decisions.

Though previous studies have examined the effects of various urban features on how much children play and where they play, such studies rely on quantitative measurements of play such as the precise location of play and the duration of play time, while people's subjective feelings regarding the playability of their environment are overlooked. In this study, we capture people's perception of place playability by employing Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to classify street view images. A deep learning model trained on the labelled data is then used to evaluate neighborhood playability for three U.S. cities: Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco. Finally, multivariate and geographically weighted regression models are used to explore how various urban features are associated with playability. We find that higher traffic speeds and crime rates are negatively associated with playability, while higher scores for perception of beauty are positively associated with playability. Interestingly, a place that is perceived as lively may not be playable. Our research provides helpful insights for urban planning focused on sustainable city growth and development, as well as for research focused on creating nourishing environments for child development. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Deep learning; Human perception of place; Playability; Street view images","Authors":"Kruse J., Kang Y., Liu Y.-N., Zhang F., Gao S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101693","x":11.1000003815,"y":0.1000000015},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":77,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Subjectively measured streetscape perceptions to inform urban design strategies for Shanghai","Abstract":"Recently, many new studies applying computer vision (CV) to street view imagery (SVI) datasets to objectively extract the view indices of various streetscape features such as trees to proxy urban scene qualities have emerged. However, human perception (e.g., imageability) have a subtle relationship to visual elements that cannot be fully captured using view indices. Conversely, subjective measures using survey and interview data explain human behaviors more. However, the effectiveness of integrating subjective measures with SVI datasets has been less discussed. To address this, we integrated crowdsourcing, CV, and machine learning (ML) to subjectively measure four important perceptions suggested by classical urban design theory. We first collected ratings from experts on sample SVIs regarding these four qualities, which became the training labels. CV segmentation was applied to SVI samples extracting streetscape view indices as the explanatory variables. We then trained ML models and achieved high accuracy in predicting scores. We found a strong correlation between the predicted complexity score and the density of urban amenities and services points of interest (POI), which validates the effectiveness of subjective measures. In addition, to test the generalizability of the proposed framework as well as to inform urban renewal strategies, we compared the measured qualities in Pudong to other five urban cores that are renowned worldwide. Rather than predicting perceptual scores directly from generic image features using a convolution neural network, our approach follows what urban design theory has suggested and confirmed as various streetscape features affecting multi-dimensional human perceptions. Therefore, the results provide more interpretable and actionable implications for policymakers and city planners. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Fast-growing cities have catalyzed the importance of designing urban spaces that citizens find pleasant and homely and that support a communal style of living. Unfortunately, there are no standardized methods or techniques to translate sonic experiences into measurable and reliable data, which urban planning professionals or the building industry could turn into innovations and solutions. Most of the data pertaining to noise pollution and city soundscapes is still based on predictive acoustic models and rarely takes any real-life experiences or physical measurements into consideration. This paper presents the concept of a smart and participatory approach for gathering sonic experiences that could be translated into measurable values. The aim is to search for data collection methods to provide data to train deep learning. With machine learning methods, it is possible to find patterns in both desirable and undesirable urban soundscapes.

In this study, we objectively measured the seemingly subjective qualities of the eye-level urban landscape perceptions with computer vision and machine learning technologies. We then explored correlations between the measured perceptual qualities and characteristics from the historical context. We chose Berlin as a research object because it is a capital city that owns a rich history of division and reunification, as well as a variety of residential zones built at different periods. We extracted 30 street features from the 150,000 Google Street View Imagery (SVI) dataset with a computer vision algorithm and evaluated eight perceptual qualities including typology, order, ecology, enclosure, aesthetics, richness, accessibility and scale with a machine learning method. Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning policies in streetscape improvement. \u00a9 Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH \u00b7.","Author Keywords":"Computer vision; Google street view image; Machine learning; Perceptual qualities","Authors":"Tian H., Han Z., Xu W., Liu X., Qiu W., Li W.","DOI":"10.14627\/537705039","x":12.5,"y":0.8799999952},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":177,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Towards Participatory Design of City Soundscapes","Abstract":"Sonic environments of fast-growing urban areas are an integral part of the quality of our everyday living in cities.

The generative model can produce heat maps that can be used to predict quantitatively the cycling and running activity in a given area, and then use urban design to enhance urban vitality in that area. In the machine learning model, the input image is a plan view of the built environment, and the output image is a heat map showing certain activities in the corresponding area.

The heat map shows the levels and conditions of the subject activity in different sections of the built environment.

The extent to which factors might influence behaviors is also studied by generating a heat map of the modified plan.

The study utilized a modern machine learning computer vision algorithm in the urban build environment to simulate the process, which starts with the visual perception of the urban street landscape and ends with the human reaction to street vitality. By analyzing the optimized trained model, we tried to identify urban street vitality\u2019s visual features and evaluate their importance. A region around the Mochou Lake in Nanjing, China, was set as our study area. Seven investigators surveyed the area, recorded their evaluation score on each site\u2019s vitality level with a corresponding picture taken on site. A total of 370 pictures and recorded score pairs from 231 valid survey sites were used to train a convolutional neural network. After optimization, a deep neural network model with 43 layers, including 11 convolutional ones, was created. Heat maps were then used to identify the features which lead to high vitality score outputs. The spatial distributions of different types of feature entities were also analyzed to help identify the spatial effects. The study found that visual features, including human, construction site, shop front, and roadside\/walking pavement, are vital ones that correspond to the vitality of the urban street. The consistency of these critical features with traditional urban vitality features indicates the model had learned useful knowledge from the training process. Applying the trained model in urban planning practices can help to improve the city environment for better attraction of residents\u2019 activities and communications. \u00a9 2020 Wuhan University.

This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks.

Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Accessible greenery; Google Street View; Human-scale; Machine learning; Space syntax; Visible greenery","Authors":"Ye Y., Richards D., Lu Y., Song X., Zhuang Y., Zeng W., Zhong T.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.028","x":11.8699998856,"y":2.0599999428},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":340,"Cited by":34.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The visual quality of streets: A human-centred continuous measurement based on machine learning algorithms and street view images","Abstract":"This study proposes a workable approach for quantitatively measuring the perceptual-based visual quality of streets, which has often relied on subjective impressions or feelings. With the help of recently emerged street view images and machine learning algorithms, an evaluation model has been trained to assess the perceived visual quality with accuracy similar to that of experienced urban designers, to provide full coverage and detailed results for a citywide area. The town centre of Shanghai was selected for the site. Around 140,000 screenshots from Baidu Street View were processed and a machine learning algorithm, SegNet, was applied to intelligently extract the pixels representing key elements affecting the visual quality of streets, including the building frontage, greenery, sky view, pedestrian space, motorisation, and diversity. A Java-based program was then produced to automatically collect the preferences of experienced urban designers on representative sample images. Another machine learning algorithm, i.e. an artificial neural network, was used to train an evaluation model to achieve a citywide, high-resolution evaluation of the visual quality of the streets. Further validation through different approaches shows this evaluation model obtains a satisfactory accuracy. The results from the artificial neural network also help to explore the high or low effects of various key elements on visual quality.

The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method. The classification was tested with experts.

Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Daily accessed street greenery; Housing price; Human scale; New urban data; Shanghai; Street view images","Authors":"Ye Y., Xie H., Fang J., Jiang H., Wang D.","DOI":"10.3390\/su11061741","x":12.3599996567,"y":1.7799999714},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":416,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Explaining subjective perceptions of public spaces as a function of the built environment: A massive data approach","Abstract":"People's perceptions of the built environment influence the way they use and navigate it.

Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Deep learning; Place semantics; Street-level imagery; Urban perception","Authors":"Zhang F., Zhou B., Liu L., Liu Y., Fung H.H., Lin H., Ratti C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.020","x":11.2299995422,"y":0.5299999714},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":472,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Holistic visual data representation for built environment assessment","Abstract":"With an increasing interest of big data and its analysis, urban planners and architects use manifold data from different sources as an indicator of urban phenomena. To analyse them, machine learning models have been gotten fame to evaluate complex urban features with correlation matrix and cross validation. There are two major types of data such as top-down and bottom-up data. Interestingly, there is a third category of data that has not been widely deployed yet which we define as the 'Holistic visual data'. It is the general impression to your visual perception of urban environment when you at a specific spot that we believe can be captured by Google Street Views. This paper aims to ask how do top-down, bottomup, and holistic visual data work individually or together to predict the built environment value in urban areas. Admittedly, housing price is a highly spatial metric that involves multifarious interests including macroeconomic policies, the development of the area, the local people, and specific houses' features. To investigate the quality of built environment, machine learning techniques are adopted for different groups of datasets. By comparing several regression and classification models for each groups of data such as top-down, bottom-up and holistic visual data with housing price, the Random Forest model could be proposed as a best model. The intricate urban matrix needs to be organized such an order, but there are multiple factors affecting urban issues including land values and housing prices.

To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents. \u00a9 2017 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Architecture; Machine learning; Physical quality; Street view image; Urban design","Authors":"Liu L., Silva E.A., Wu C., Wang H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2017.06.003","x":11.6400003433,"y":0.7200000286},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":492,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Multiple images of the city: Unveiling group-specific urban perceptions through a crowdsourcing game","Abstract":"Our perceptions of public spaces are central for our experience in the city. Understanding which factors shape this perception informs both urban planners, that aim at improving city life, as well as computational models that help us navigate in urban spaces. To understand cities at scale, crowdsourcing games have been employed successfully to evaluate citizens' opinions about cities and urban scenes. By analyzing human perceptions from residents of a mid-sized Brazilian city, this work brings three novel contributions. First, we consider theories from urban design to explore through crowdsourcing which high and low level features in an urban space are linked to perceptions of safety and pleasantness. Secondly, this paper leverages theory from urban sociology and anthropology to show how the sociodemographic pro.le of the citizens signi.cantly mediate their perception of safeness and pleasantness of places. Finally, we show that features of the urban form proposed by urbanists can be combined with sociodemographics to improve the accuracy of machine learning models that predict which scene a person will .nd more safe or pleasant. .is last result paves the road for more personalized recommendations in cold-start scenarios. \u00a9 2017 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Crowdsourcing; Urban Informatics; Urban Perception","Authors":"Candeia D., Figueiredo F., Andrade N., Quercia D.","DOI":"10.1145\/3078714.3078728","x":11.9099998474,"y":-0.3100000024},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":505,"Cited by":13.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Feature extraction and k-means clustering approach to explore important features of urban identity","Abstract":"Public spaces play an important role in the processes of formation, generation and change of urban identity. Under present day conditions, the identities of cities are rapidly deteriorating and vanishing. Therefore, the importance of urban design, which is a means of designing urban spaces and their physical and social aspects, is ever growing. This paper proposes a novel methodology by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering approach to find important features of the urban identity from public space. K. Lynch's work and Space Syntax theory are reconstructed and integrated with POI (Points of Interest) to quantify the quality of the public space. A case study of Z\u00fcrich city is used to test of these redefinitions and features of urban identity. The results show that PCA and K-means clustering approach can identify the urban identity and explore important features. This strategy could help to improve planning and design processes and generation of new urban patterns with more appropriate features and qualities. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Feature extraction; K-means clustering; Space syntax; Urban identity","Authors":"Chang M.-C., Bus P., Schmitt G.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2017.00015","x":12.6199998856,"y":0.3799999952},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":523,"Cited by":97.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Measuring visual enclosure for street walkability: Using machine learning algorithms and Google Street View imagery","Abstract":"One major limitation currently with studying street level urban design qualities for walkability is the often inconsistent and unreliable measures of streetscape features across different field surveyors even with costly training due to lack of more objective processes, which also make large scale study difficult. The recent advances in sensor technologies and digitization have produced a wealth of data to help research activities by facilitating improved measurements and conducting large scale analysis. This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Enclosure; Machine learning; Street design features; Walkability","Authors":"Yin L., Wang Z.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apgeog.2016.09.024","x":11.5600004196,"y":1.6299999952},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":529,"Cited by":11.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"On urban soundscape mapping: A computer can predict the outcome of soundscape assessments","Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a computer may predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, based on acoustic data only. It may be argued that this is impossible, because a computer lack life experience. Moreover, if the computer was able to make an accurate prediction, we also wanted to know what information it needed to make this prediction. We recruited 33 students (18 female; Mage = 25.4 yrs., SDage = 3.6) out of which 30 assessed how pleasant and eventful 102 unique soundscape excerpts (30 s) from Stockholm were. Based on the Bag of Frames approach, a Support Vector Regression learning algorithm was used to identify relationships between various acoustic features of the acoustics signals and perceived affective quality. We found that the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients provided strong predictions for both Pleasantness (R2 = 0.74) and Eventfulness (R2 = 0.83). This model performed better than the average individual in the experiment in terms of internal consistency of individual assessments. Taken together, the results show that a computer can predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, which is promising for future soundscape mapping. \u00a9 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA).

An urban design problem is viewed as a multiple-criteria optimization problem. The outlined feature of an urban design problem is the dependence of a design goal on a context of the problem. We model the design goal as a randomized fitness measure that depends on the context. In terms of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), the defined measure corresponds to a subjective expected utility of a user. In the first stage of the proposed approach we let the algorithm explore a design space using clustering techniques. The second stage is an interactive design loop; the user makes a proposal, then the program optimizes it, gets the user's feedback and returns back the control over the application interface.","Author Keywords":"Interactive machine learning; MCDM; Multiplecriteria optimization; Urban design","Authors":"Chirkin A.M., K\u00f6nig R.","DOI":"10.1145\/2898365.2899795","x":11.3800001144,"y":-0.4199999869},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":534,"Cited by":null,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Procedural urban environments for FPS games","Abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to procedural generation of urban maps for First Person Shooter (FPS) games.

In this multi-disciplinary experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA) bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical activity levels with the associated health benefits. A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area. A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of individual or group of these variables to better understand how the built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes. This collaboration was our first phase in developing intelligent tools for designers that provided site-specific user-specific data to the planner or designer of pedestrian space.","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Multi-disciplinary design analysis, Walking for health; Pedestrian landscapes; User evaluation","Authors":"Naderi J.R., Raman B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2004.11.012","x":12.8599996567,"y":-0.6200000048}]
