-1,0.9110942155,3,,2022,Article,Spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms of street vending from the social sensing perspective: A comparison between law-enforcement reported and residents complain events,"Street vending is an important part of the urban informal economy, especially in developing countries. How to control its negative externalities while augmenting its positive roles in the urban socio-economic system poses challenges to urban planning and governance. Existing studies have insufficiently addressed the issue largely due to the lack of high-frequent observation data for street vending events. By introducing socially sensed big data from the smart urban governance platform, as well as records from the “12345” urban problem complaint hotline of Jiangbei District, Ningbo, China, this paper examines and compares the spatiotemporal patterns and occurrence mechanisms of street vending events from both the urban managers' “top-down” and the urban residents' “bottom-up” points of view. Statistical and machine learning models show that the distribution of street vending activities as sensed by the two subjects does not overlap. The former concentrates in central urban areas and work times, while the latter is scattered distributed in everyday life-related places and times. The findings reaffirm the existence of perception bias in social sensing data and show the potential for utilizing such bias to nudge better urban governance practices. Theoretically and empirically, this research has contributed to promoting the people-oriented transformation of urban governance. © 2022",High-frequency; Perception bias; Smart urban governance; Social sensing; Spatiotemporal big data; Street vending,"Li C., Huang Y., Shen Y., Xu L.",10.1016/j.cities.2022.103597,1.0399999619,-0.2199999988,"['smart urban governance', 'Street vending', 'social sensing data', 'urban problem complaint', 'urban informal economy']"
-1,0.9110942155,4,,2022,Article,Detecting individuals' spatial familiarity with urban environments using eye movement data,"The spatial familiarity of environments is an important high-level user context for location-based services (LBS). Knowing users' familiarity level of environments is helpful for enabling context-aware LBS that can automatically adapt information services according to users' familiarity with the environment. Unlike state-of-the-art studies that used questionnaires, sketch maps, mobile phone positioning (GPS) data, and social media data to measure spatial familiarity, this study explored the potential of a new type of sensory data - eye movement data - to infer users' spatial familiarity of environments using a machine learning approach. We collected 38 participants' eye movement data when they were performing map-based navigation tasks in familiar and unfamiliar urban environments. We trained and cross-validated a random forest classifier to infer whether the users were familiar or unfamiliar with the environments (i.e., binary classification). By combining basic statistical features and fixation semantic features, we achieved a best accuracy of 81% in a 10-fold classification and 70% in the leave-one-task-out (LOTO) classification. We found that the pupil diameter, fixation dispersion, saccade duration, fixation count and duration on the map were the most important features for detecting users' spatial familiarity. Our results indicate that detecting users' spatial familiarity from eye tracking data is feasible in map-based navigation and only a few seconds (e.g., 5 s) of eye movement data is sufficient for such detection. These results could be used to develop context-aware LBS that adapt their services to users' familiarity with the environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Eye tracking; Machine learning; Pedestrian navigation; Random forest; Spatial familiarity; Wayfinding,"Liao H., Zhao W., Zhang C., Dong W., Huang H.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101758,1.0700000525,-1.2999999522999999,"['spatial familiarity', 'eye movement data', 'random forest classifier', 'urban environment', 'mobile phone positioning']"
-1,0.9110942155,13,,2022,Article,Designing Data Validation Framework for Crowd-Sourced Road Monitoring Applications,"With the wide availability of smartphone sensing and the Internet connections, mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) has become a promising paradigm for collecting opinions and providing services to the citizens. In the smart city context, crowd data, both in the form of their opinions and in the form of sensing data from their smartphones are very useful for scalable monitoring of resource demand and planning. Since these devices are portable, it is carried by almost every citizen, thus making them ubiquitous. However, the main bottleneck of such crowd intelligence-based services is data validation as opinions can be biased, influenced by some factors not relevant to the problem in focus. So, in this paper, a data validation framework utilizing machine learning techniques for mobile crowdsourcing applications is proposed. It is focused on MCS-based road monitoring applications. The idea of crowdsourced urban area road monitoring application(CURMA) presented in the paper is implemented and results show the crucial need for such data validation frameworks. © 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).",Crowd sourcing; Data validation; Machine learning; Naive Bayes,"Saha J., Roy S., Das T.K., Purkait K., Chowdhury C.",10.1007/s40031-022-00713-x,1.3700000048,1.2300000191,"['crowd data', 'road monitoring application', 'validation framework', 'smart city', 'machine learning technique']"

With the rapid development of urban data and machine learning, we can discover the patterns of human mobility with these data and technology to guide commercial district discovery. In this article, we propose an unsupervised commercial district discovery framework via embedding space clustering on graph convolution networks to solve the problem of commercial district discovery. Specifically, the proposed framework aggregates human mobility features according to geographic similarity by graph convolution networks. Based on the graph convolution network embedding space, we apply hierarchical clustering to mine the latent functional regions hidden in different human patterns. Then, with the kernel density estimation, we can obtain the semantic labels for the clustering results to discover commercial districts. Finally, we analyze the multisource data of the Xiaoshan District and Chengdu City, and experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Commercial district discovery; embedding space; graph convolution networks (GCNs); human mobility,"Shen G., Zhao Z., Kong X.",10.1109/TII.2021.3051934,2.0199999809,-2.0099999905,"['commercial district discovery', 'graph convolution network', 'human mobility', 'kernel density', 'hierarchical clustering']"

While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models: (1) most existing approaches solely capture spatial correlations among neighbors on predefined graph structure, and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete graph connections; and (2) existing methods are defective to capture the temporal trends because the recurrent and stacking structure employed in these methods suffers from the long-range temporal dependency vanquish problem. To overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the dynamic spatialoral dependencies of traffic flows, we propose a new traffic speed prediction framework for multiscale graph attention networks (MS-GATNs). In particular, MS-GATNs is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture that learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multiheads attention mechanism is introduced to empower our model with the capability of capturing complex nonstationary temporal dynamics. Experiments on real-world traffic data sets demonstrate that MS-GATNs outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in long-term forecasting. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Graph convolution; Traffic speed prediction,"Wu X., Fang J., Liu Z., Wu X.",10.1061/JTEPBS.0000600,3.0999999046,-1.6599999666,"['traffic speed prediction', 'graph attention network', 'crucial urban data', 'capture spatial correlation', 'temporal trend']"
-1,0.9110942155,32,,2021,Article,A machine learning-based approach for classifying tourists and locals using geotagged photos: the case of Tokyo,"In tourism-dependent cities, investigating the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of tourist flows is crucial for better urban planning in both steady and perturbed states. In recent years, researchers have started relying more on photo-based, geotagged social data, which offer insights about tourists, popular hotspots, and mobility patterns. However, distinguishing between tourists and locals from this data is problematic since residence information is often not provided. While previous studies rely on heuristic (e.g., period of stay) and probabilistic (Shannon entropy) approaches, this paper proposes a method for classifying tourists and residents based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and considering parameters that could explain the variability between the two (e.g., weather, mobility, and photo content). This approach was applied to Flickr users’ geotagged photos taken in Tokyo’s 23 special wards from July 2008 to December 2019. The results show that stacked ensemble (SE) models are superior to models based on five supervised-learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), distributed random forest (DRF), deep learning (DL), and extremely randomized trees (XRT). Temporal entropy (TEN), mobility on workdays, and frequent visits to amusement venues and crowded places influenced how users were classified. While temporal distribution showed similar monthly/hourly patterns, spatial distribution varied. The proposed approach might pave the way for scholars to carry out future tourism research on different topics and subsequently support policymakers in the decision-making process, specifically in urban settings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Big data; Classification; Flickr; Geotagged photos; Locals; Machine learning; Tokyo; Tourists,"Derdouri A., Osaragi T.",10.1007/s40558-021-00208-3,1.3700000048,-1.0399999619,"['tourist flow', 'gradient boosting', 'geotagged photo', 'social data', 'city']"

Local governments use data collected from these platforms to solve reported issues. Data can also be used by governments for data-driven decision-making and to improve the operation of the platforms themselves. In particular, as citizen reports become increasingly popular, there is a need to handle them more efficiently. In this paper, we present an analysis of ZüriWieNeu, a map-based website helping people in Zurich, Switzerland to report urban issues related to waste, broken streetlamps, or graffiti, among others. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we analyze what machine-extracted textual, visual, spatial and temporal features reveal about the dynamics of reporting and the content of each report category. This analysis provides a snapshot of the common patterns of urban issues in the Zurich area.

Due to the development of deep learning, traffic accident prediction can evolve from traditional machine learning algorithms to neural networks to predict the risk of accidents in a short period of time (hour level) in the future. However, the large urban area and sparse traffic accident samples will bring difficulties to deep learning prediction. If it is not solved, it will easily lead to zero-expansion problems, leading to inaccurate prediction results. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a space-gated memory network (SGMN) based on deep learning. The model combines real-time accident risk, real-time traffic flow, and real-time weather with multiple inputs to predict sub-regions with high accident risk. In order to verify the performance of the model, two real data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show that the performance of SGMN is better than that of commonly used memory neural networks such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, Convulsion and Hereto-ConvLSTM, which validates the model. © 2021 IEEE.",deep learning; risk prediction; traffic accident prediction; zero expansion problem,"Lai S., Zhou C., Song X., Zhang X.",10.1109/EIECS53707.2021.9588055,3.9000000954000003,-0.8500000238000001,"['traffic accident prediction', 'memory neural network', 'large urban area', 'high accident risk', 'deep learning']"
5,0.9110942155,69,,2021,Article,Unveiling transit mobility structure towards sustainable cities: An integrated graph embedding approach,"Detecting urban mobility structure, i.e., segmenting urban areas into disjoint clusters with similar mobility patterns, can facilitate our understanding of how a city is organized and how different parts of a city interact with each other, which underpin informed decision-making in achieving sustainable urban transportation development and resilient society. In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Auto-encoder; Clustering; Graph embedding; Public transit; Smart card data,"Zhang T., Duan X., Li Y.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103027,1.9299999475,-1.7799999714,"['urban mobility structure', 'big transit data', 'mobility structure detection', 'urban data', 'sustainable urban transportation']"

One of the most prolific application domains is sports analytics due to the availability of real-world multi-agent datasets, where such techniques are used to recognize and predict offensive and defensive strategies in a range of team sports. However, the use of advanced machine learning techniques requires the large datasets to be annotated by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Active learning is a methodology that significantly cuts down the data-annotation time on large datasets. In this paper, we investigate active learning strategies to annotate spatio-temporal datasets for the purpose of classification model building. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on a dataset obtained from professional basketball games to classify an offensive strategy known as 'Pick-and-Roll'. Several neural network architectures are investigated for the classification of more than 900 segments of basketball plays. The results obtained suggest that the proposed, preferred, methodology is well suited for annotating large spatio-temporal datasets and has the potential to be applicable across a range of team sports and non-sports usage scenarios. © 2021 IEEE.",Active Learning; Basketball; Machine Learning; Spatio-temporal Data,"Ai S., Na J., Silva V.D., Caine M.",10.1109/PRML52754.2021.9520715,2.1300001144,0.1599999964,"['sport analytics', 'Active learning', 'vehicular traffic modelling', 'offensive strategy', 'classification model']"

The quality of the first phase, i.e. trip generation, determines the performance of the global course. The majority of trip generation forecasting models highly rely on mathematical derivation and have many predictor variables during the prediction, which leads to low accuracy of results and requires laboriously hand-crafted design of input vectors. This paper is the first to introduce the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm for trip generation prediction, and harmonizes such a powerful machine learning method with traditional urban planning requirements to achieve better prediction performance. Unlike the commonly used linear regression method, GBDT can automatically perform feature selection and model the non-linear relationships between input and output variables.

In recent years, the expansion of chain enterprises in new cities brings some challenges because of two aspects: (1) data scarcity in new cities, so most existing models tend to not work (i.e., overfitting), because the superior performance of these works is conditioned on large-scale training samples; (2) data distribution discrepancy among different cities, so knowledge learned from other cities cannot be utilized directly in new cities. In this article, we propose a task-adaptative model-agnostic meta-learning framework, namely, MetaStore, to tackle these two challenges and improve the prediction performance in new cities with insufficient data for optimal store placement, by transferring prior knowledge learned from multiple data-rich cities. Specifically, we develop a task-adaptative meta-learning algorithm to learn city-specific prior initializations from multiple cities, which is capable of handling the multimodal data distribution and accelerating the adaptation in new cities compared to other methods. In addition, we design an effective learning strategy for MetaStore to promote faster convergence and optimization by sampling high-quality data for each training batch in view of noisy data in practical applications.

Within the field of urban studies, an old question worth revisiting with these new technologies is how to best trace the spatial boundaries that circumscribe a place or location to explore non-work activity. In this study, we explore a data-driven definition of places as units of analysis that can be used to explore non-work activity in Singapore. Such a definition of place characterizes an urban space in terms of its concentration of activity and the topology of the built environment–features that are especially important to urban planners. We utilize available smartphone data to develop a systematic framework to identify locations with a concentrated human presence. Using a cylinder moving over a grid representing Singapore, we scan aggregated smartphones locational requests (by time and cell), identifying areas with atypical high concentrations at a given time. Our tool identified 93 places with a concentrated human presence. Direct observation of six of these places at the selected times in conjunction with additional transportation and population data indicated that the topology of commercial establishments provided a strong approximation of non-work activity at a given time and place. Having established the relevance of commercial establishments in approximating non-work activity, then points-of-interest data within the 93 derived places are used to propose a typology of commercial patches, based on their spatial configuration. Nine metrics of the geometry and topology of patches of establishments, such as compacity and their dependence on proximity to shopping malls, were developed. These combined variables revealed more temporal and spatial variety within locations than had previously been recognized. The most popular places for non-work activity were densely configured with various commercial sub-spaces or patches appealing to different lifestyles and income groups. This study suggests that a location/place can be best defined as a highly detailed, multi-faceted, and always evolving area of activity rather than as a fixed location with temporal and unmovable boundaries. Suggesting a dynamic redefinition of location/place that builds on other recent work, this work offers potential contributions to locational models for non-work activity. © The Author(s) 2020.",cell phone data; clustering; Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise; machine learning; Non-work travel; pattern detection; transportation,"Lopez R.P., Ferreira J.",10.1177/2399808320970209,1.1499999762,-0.8100000024,"['urban space', 'smartphones locational request', 'population data', 'activity', 'popular place']"

In the field of urban planning, it is pertinent to understand both how such techniques can advance our understanding of cities, and how they can be embedded within transparent and effective digital planning tools, known as planning support systems. This research specifically focuses on two related contributions. First, it investigates the role of planning support systems in supporting a participatory data analytics approach through an iterative process of developing and evaluating a planning support system environment. Second, it investigates how specifically machine learning planning support systems can be co-designed by built environment practitioners and stakeholders in this environment to solve a real planning issue in Sydney, Australia. This paper presents the results of applied research undertaken through the design and implementation of four workshops, involving 57 participants who were involved in a co-design process. The research follows a mixed-methods approach, studying a wide array of measures related to participatory analytics, task load, perceived added value, recordings and observations. The results highlight recommendations regarding the design and evaluation of planning support system environments for co-design and their coupling with machine learning techniques. It was found that consistency and transparency are highly valued and central to the design of a planning support system in this context. General attitudes towards machine learning and artificial intelligence as techniques for planners and developers were positive, as they were seen as both potentially transformative but also as simply another technique to assist with workflows. Some conceptual challenges were encountered driven by practitioners' simultaneous need for concrete scenarios for accurate predictions, paired with a desire for predictions to drive the development of these scenarios. Insights from this work can inform future planning support system evaluation and co-design studies, in particular those aiming to support democracy enhancement, greater inclusion and more efficient resource allocation through a participatory analytics approach. © The Author(s) 2020.",co-design; Machine learning; mixed methods; planning support systems; urban development,"Lock O., Bain M., Pettit C.",10.1177/2399808320939974,1.0499999523,0.75,"['urban planning', 'participatory analytics approach', 'machine learning', 'effective digital planning', 'built environment practitioner']"

Currently, various methods such as the machine learning algorithms, statistical methods, and semantic analysis are widely applied to identify and extract human mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a simple and generic paradigm for mining human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data using complex network analysis. The essential ideas behind the proposed paradigm mainly include (1) creating weighted complex networks of GPS trajectories and (2) extracting the human mobility patterns by analyzing the structures and metrics of the created complex networks of GPS trajectories. To evaluate the performance of the proposed paradigm, we design five groups of experiments and identify the mobility patterns of the selected five persons based on the selected five network analysis metrics.

-1,0.9110942155,133,,2021,Article,Applying machine learning and geolocation techniques to social media data (Twitter) to develop a resource for urban planning,"With all the recent attention focused on big data, it is easy to overlook that basic vital statistics remain difficult to obtain in most of the world. What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012–2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments. © 2021 Milusheva et al.

From the perspectives of peoples (e.g., passenger, driver, and policymaker), vehicle, road, and environment, this paper describes the current research status of TTOC's big data in six hot topics, including the ridership factor, spatio-temporal distribution and travel behavior, cruising strategy and passenger service market partition, route planning, transportation emission and new-energy, and TTOC's data extensional application. These topics were included in five mainstreams as follows: (1) abundant studies often focus only on determinant analysis on given transportation (taxi, transit, online car-hailing); the exploration of ridership patterns for a multi-modal transportation mode is rare; furthermore, multiple aspects of factors were not considered synchronously in a wide time span; (2) travel behavior research mainly concentrates on the commuting trips and distribution patterns of various travel indices (e.g., distance, displacement, time); (3) the taxi driver-searching strategy can be divided into autopsychic cruising and system dispatching; (4) the spatio-temporal distribution character of TTOC's fuel consumption (FC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a hotspot recently, and there has been a recommendation for electric taxi (ET) in urban cities to decrease transportation congestion is proposed; and (5) based on TTOC and point of interest (POI) multi-source data, many machine learning algorithms were used to predict travel condition indices, land use, and travel behavior. Then, the main bottlenecks and research directions that can be explored in the future are discussed.

An intelligent transportation system can analyze the traffic data with time and space characteristics in the city and acquire rich and valuable knowledge, and it is of great significance to realize intelligent traffic scheduling and urban planning. This article specifically introduces the extensive application of urban transportation infrastructure data in the construction and development of smart cities. This article first explains the related concepts of big data and intelligent transportation systems and uses big data to illustrate the operation of intelligent transportation systems in the construction of smart cities. Based on the machine learning and deep learning method, this paper is aimed at the passenger flow and traffic flow in the smart city transportation system. This paper deeply excavates the time, space, and other hidden features. In this paper, the traffic volume of the random sections in the city is predicted by using the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model, and the data are compared with the other five models (VAR, FNN, GCGRU, STGCN, and DGCNN). The experimental results show that compared with the other 4 models, the GCNN model has an increase of 8% to 10% accuracy and 15% fault tolerance. In forecasting morning and evening peak traffic flow, the accuracy of the GCNN model is higher than that of other models, and its trend is basically consistent with the actual traffic volume, the predicted results can reflect the actual traffic flow data well. Aimed at the application of intelligent transportation in an intelligent city, this paper proposes a machine learning prediction model based on big data, and this is of great significance for studying the mechanical learning of such problems.

Most of the existing methods generally divide the urban area into grids and use vehicle GPS trajectories and metrocard check-in data, combined with machine learning or deep learning models to predict human OD flow. However, these kinds of methods are challenging to capture fine-grained human mobility patterns. Moreover, these methods usually deviate from the actual human OD transfer patterns on a citywide scale due to the particularity of different datasets. To this end, in this paper, we use large-scale mobile phone signal data to achieve human OD flow prediction between the coverage of varying signal base stations. Many signal base stations are distributed in urban geographical space, collecting all the mobile phone user's location information to obtain large-scale fine-grained unbiased human OD flow data. Due to the lack of natural topology structure between base stations, this paper adopts a TGCN model combined with a graph fusion module to pretrain the dynamic population distribution prediction task. The parameters of the graph fusion module are employed to capture the different semantic information in the proposed hybrid machine learning method and finally achieve citywide human OD flow prediction.

In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes.

The significance of smart cities lies in not having technology itself but using technology with a novel approach to solve urban problems, enhance the quality of life for urban residents, and optimize government performance.

Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the ‘forest’ of data, and to miss the ‘trees’ of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole ‘forest’ of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, cities need a more intelligent ""brain"" to form more intelligent and efficient transportation systems. At present, as a type of machine learning, the traditional clustering algorithm still has limitations. K-means algorithm is widely used to solve traffic clustering problems, but it has limitations, such as sensitivity to initial points and poor robustness. Therefore, based on the hybrid architecture of Quantum Annealing (QA) and brain-inspired cognitive computing, this study proposes QA and Brain-Inspired Clustering Algorithm (QABICA) to solve the problem of urban taxi-stand locations. Based on the traffic trajectory data of Xi'an and Chengdu provided by Didi Chuxing, the clustering results of our algorithm and K-means algorithm are compared. We find that the average taxi-stand location bias of the final result based on QABICA is smaller than that based on K-means, and the bias of our algorithm can effectively reduce the tradition K-means bias by approximately 42%, up to approximately 83%, with higher robustness. QA algorithm is able to jump out of the local suboptimal solutions and approach the global optimum, and brain-inspired cognitive computing provides search feedback and direction. Thus, we will further consider applying our algorithm to analyze urban traffic flow, and solve traffic congestion and other key problems in intelligent transportation. © 2020 Tsinghua University Press.

Many downstream applications require comprehensive analysis like geographic information retrieval, recommender systems, geographic knowledge graphs, and in general, understanding urban spaces [28]. Points of Interests (POI), as one of the most researched aspects of urban data, has been successfully modeled using concepts borrowed from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the work of Place2Vec [28], a Word2Vec-like statistical model is proposed to represent spatial adjacency with a continuous embedding space. This method successfully models the functional semantics of POIs with regard to several human-assessment based evaluations. However, though the Place2Vec model addresses the distributional heterogeneity within a given spatial context with ITDL augmentation, it does not address the spatial heterogeneity among different regions. To solve this problem, we propose to introduce a hierarchical, density-based, self-adjusting clustering mechanism. The boundary of relatedness and unrelatedness is learned from the given context, where denser areas have tighter bounds while sparser areas have looser ones. We train our model on both the baseline Yelp hierarchical dataset [28] and our OpenStreetMap dataset. We demonstrate that 1) our model significantly improves the performance on 2 of the 3 baseline tasks and the stability of training, and 2) our model generalizes excellently across 112 cities of radically different scales (minimum 1725 POIs, maximum 2694070 POIs), regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa) and types (commercial, touristy, industrial, etc.) without the need of adjusting or tuning any hyperparameters.

However, due to the lack of complete directly measured data on urban traffic flow, existing studies cannot adequately mine the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations characterizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Electronic registration identification (ERI), which is an emerging technology for uniquely identifying a vehicle, can help collect the travel records of all vehicles. This inspires us to employ ERI big data for traffic flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spatial-temporal feature optimization method with ERI big data for short-term traffic flow prediction based on a gradient–boosted regression tree, called DSTO-GBRT. Firstly, the framework of DSTO-GBRT is built. Secondly, we analyze the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations among the current prediction point and upstream correlative points using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Thirdly, to eliminate the linear correlations among features, we exploit principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the original training data and obtain optimized training data. In the experiment, real-world ERI big data from Chongqing are employed for the proposed DSTO-GBRT method. Compared with ST-GBRT, ARIMA, DSTO-BPNN and DSTO-SVM, the results demonstrate that DSTO-GBRT can provide timely and adaptive prediction even in rush hour, when traffic conditions change rapidly. Furthermore, compared with DSO-GBRT and DTO-GBRT, the results show that the proposed DSTO-GBRT method is more accurate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Dynamic spatial-temporal feature; ERI big data; Gradient-boosted regression tree; Principal component analysis; Traffic flow prediction,"Zheng L., Yang J., Chen L., Sun D., Liu W.",10.1016/j.neucom.2020.05.038,16.73,-1.83,"['traffic flow prediction', 'ERI big data', 'principal component analysis', 'intelligent transportation system', 'regression tree']"

In contrast, emerging data collection methods have enabled researchers to leverage machine learning techniques with a tremendous amount of mobility data for analyzing and forecasting people's behaviors. In this study, we developed a reinforcement learning-based approach for modeling and simulation of people mass movement using the global positioning system (GPS) data. Unlike traditional travel demand modeling approaches, our method focuses on the problem of inferring the spatio-temporal preferences of individuals from the observed trajectories, and is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques. We applied the model to the data collected from a smartphone application and attempted to replicate a large amount of the population's daily movement by incorporating with agent-based multi-modal traffic simulation technologies.

Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation's companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",ISO 37120; Machine learning; Smart City services; Text Classification; Topic Classification,"Bencke L., Cechinel C., Munoz R.",10.1016/j.future.2020.03.057,16.73,1.54,"['classifier', 'city service dimension', 'social network message', 'text datasets', 'sustainable city']"

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). © 2020 IEEE.",Deep Learning; LSTM; Machine Learning; POI; Urban Mobility Prediction,"Askari B., Le Quy T., Ntoutsi E.",10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7,16.85,-1.26,"['LSTM model', 'taxis', 'IoT sensor', 'sequence', 'machine learning']"

The primary focus of this research is to leverage the abundance of trajectory data to automatically and accurately learn latent semantic relationships between different geographical areas (e.g., semantically correlated neighborhoods of a city) as revealed by patterns of moving objects over time. While previous studies have utilized trajectories for this type of analysis at the level of a single geographical area, the results cannot be easily generalized to inform comparative analysis of different geographical areas. In this paper, we study this problem systematically. First, we present a method that utilizes trajectories to learn low-dimensional representations of geographical areas in an embedded space. Then, we develop a statistical method that allows to quantify the degree to which real trajectories deviate from a theoretical null model. The method allows to (a) distinguish geographical proximity to semantic proximity, and (b) inform a comparative analysis of two (or more) models obtained by trajectories defined on different geographical areas. This deep analysis can improve our understanding of how space is perceived by individuals and inform better decisions of urban planning. Our experimental evaluation aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed statistical method in two large-scale real-world data sets coming from the New York City and the city of Porto, Portugal, respectively. The methods we present are generic and can be utilized to inform a number of useful applications, ranging from location-based services, such as point-of-interest recommendations, to finding semantic relationships between different cities. © 2020 IEEE.",Machine learning; Network representation learning; Spatial databases; Statistical inference; Trajectory data mining,"Mehmood S., Papagelis M.",10.1109/MDM48529.2020.00032,10.0500001907,-0.1400000006,"['distinguish geographical proximity', 'latent semantic relationship', 'trajectory data', 'urban planning', 'deep analysis']"

This study presents a reliable method that reveals the structure of cities mainly based on clustering analysis using a new similarity measure. Several previous studies have used well-known clustering algorithms in machine learning fields, such as k-means clustering based on temporal mobility patterns of regions, whereas other studies have applied community detection algorithms on networks that depict traffic flows. However, the former does not reflect spatial interactions among places or areas, and the latter groups' places or areas with different land uses into the same cluster. To address these issues in existing approaches, this study proposes a new similarity method that considers not only temporal mobility patterns of areas but also spatial interactions with other areas. Moreover, the study combines spectral clustering repeated several times with hierarchical clustering to obtain a reliable structure that keeps the contiguity of clusters and determine the hierarchy of different areal units. The application of the proposed method to the data for Seoul, South Korea, reveals that the proposed clustering process divides a city into relatively homogeneous areas in terms of land uses. The flow maps based on the clustering results also revealed the spatial interactions between different areas and identify the polycentric structure of Seoul. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",city structure; clustering analysis; data mining; public transportation; Smart cards,Kim K.,10.1109/TITS.2019.2910548,1.6699999571,-1.7000000477000001,"['clustering', 'urban planning', 'temporal mobility pattern', 'depict traffic', 'new similarity measure']"

Numerous methods have been proposed to identify urban land use, in which points of interest (POI) data is widely used, and sometimes other data source like GPS trajectories is incorporated. However, previous works have hardly fully utilized the global spatial information contained in the POI data, or ignored correlations between features when integrating multiple data source, so resulting in information loss. In this study, we propose an integrated framework titled Region2vec to detect urban land use type by combining POI and mobile phone data. First, POI-based region embeddings are generated by applying Glove model and LDA model to mine the global spatial information and land use topic distributions respectively. The mobile phone data is utilized to generate human activity pattern-based embeddings. Then a similarity matrix is constructed according to POI-based and activity pattern-based embeddings. Finally, the similarity measures are regarded as clustering features to extract the urban land use results. Experiments are implemented and compared with other urban land use algorithms based on data in Sanya, China. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The lack of reliable models for understanding and predicting mobility needs during urban events causes issues for mobility service users, providers as well as urban planners. In this article, we tackle the problem of building reliable supervised models for predicting the spatial and temporal impact of planned special events with respect to road traffic. We adopt a supervised machine learning approach to predict event impact from historical data and analyse effectiveness of a variety of features, covering, for instance, features of the events as well as mobility- and infrastructure-related features. Our evaluation results on real-world event data containing events from several venues in the Hannover region in Germany demonstrate that the proposed combinations of event-, mobility- and infrastructure-related features show the best performance and are able to accurately predict spatial and temporal impact on road traffic in the event context in this region. In particular, a comparison with both event-based and event-agnostic baselines shows superior capacity of our models to predict impact of planned special events on urban traffic. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Event impact; Planned special events; Road traffic; Urban mobility,"Tempelmeier N., Dietze S., Demidova E.",10.1007/s10707-019-00366-x,8.8900003433,0.0900000036,"['urban event causes', 'supervised machine', 'historical data', 'planner', 'Crosstown traffic']"

The toolkit for urban scientists is expanding with computational methods from AI to machine learning, data mining and advanced spatial analyses. Together with vast amount of data of urban phenomena and new lifestyles emerging from virtuality and cybernetic systems, this ‘smartification’ makes the planning and analyses more challenging while providing new tools to respond to them. In this article I propose a project for better understanding and guiding the future smart city based on dynamic urban theories such as those studying complex adaptive systems, urban morphology, urban economy and mobility systems. I argue that we need to carry out empirical research on ongoing change to learn about novel, becoming spatial and functional patterns in the city, and apply both theories and imaginary visions to be able to grasp the likely qualitative transition in humans’ life following the ubiquitous use of technology. The project is built around three coupled modules, urban space, mobility and urban economics, and it will be carried out in the city of Tallinn, Estonia.

However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geocontextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. To enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation, a multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions, forcing the embeddings to encapsulate effective representation for flow prediction. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model using real-world dataset from New York City and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against the state of the art.

This research has benefited urban planning, logistics, animal migration understanding, and much more. Typically, the movement is captured as precise geographic coordinates and time stamps with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Although some research uses computational techniques to take advantage of implicit movement in descriptions of route directions, hiking paths, and historical exploration routes, innovation would accelerate with a large and diverse corpus. We created a corpus of sentences labeled as describing geographic movement or not and including the type of entity moving. Creating this corpus proved difficult without any comparable corpora to start with, high human labeling costs, and since movement can at times be interpreted differently. To overcome these challenges, we developed an iterative process employing hand labeling, crowd voting for confirmation, and machine learning to predict more labels. By merging advances in word embeddings with traditional machine learning models and model ensembling, prediction accuracy is at an acceptable level to produce a large silver-standard corpus despite the small gold-standard corpus training set.

Solving the issue of congestion by increasing the number of roads is not always the most cost-effective solution as it represents massive changes in city infrastructures that have been present for decades. Urban planning shapes the environment around us but fails to address specifically the future traffic clogging. Our research tackles the problem of traffic congestion by proposing a system for vehicle detection, identification, and count, allied with reinforcement learning for traffic congestion anticipation and prediction.

Most existing studies on urban functional zoning and land use classification either largely rely on low-frequency remote sensing images, which are constrained to the block level due to their spatial scale limitation, or suffer from low accuracy and high uncertainty when using dynamic data, such as social media and traffic data. This paper proposes an hour-day-spectrum (HDS) approach for generating six types of distribution waveforms of taxi pick-up and drop-off points which serve as interpretation indicators of the social functions of AOIs. To achieve this goal, we first performed fine-grained cleaning of the drop-off points to eliminate the spatial errors caused by taxi drivers. Next, buffer and spatial clustering were integrated to explore the associations between travel behavior and AOIs. Third, the identification of AOI types was made by using the standard HDS method combined with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Finally, some matching tests were carried out by similarity indexes of a standard HDS and sample HDS, i.e., the Gaussian kernel function and Pearson coefficient, to ensure matching accuracy. The experiment was conducted in the Chongchuan and Gangzha Districts, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. By training 50 AOI samples, six types of standard HDS of residential districts, schools, hospitals, and shopping malls were obtained. Then, 108 AOI samples were tested, and the overall accuracy was found to be 90.74%. This approach generates value-added services of the taxi trajectory and provides a continuous update and fine-grained supplementary method for the identification of land use types. In addition, the approach is object-oriented and based on AOIs, and can be combined with image interpretation and other methods to improve the identification effect. © 2019 by the authors.",AOI; Land use type; Machine learning; Social function; Urban functional zoning,"Zhou T., Liu X., Qian Z., Chen H., Tao F.",10.3390/ijgi9010007,1.7400000095,-1.3799999952,"['urban functional zoning', 'similarity index', 'taxi', 'traffic data', 'land use classification']"

The quality of prediction is limited by the information accessible to individual logistics business entities, and further complicated by the complex urban road system. Data collection under the auspices of smart city initiatives worldwide provides exciting new opportunities to overcome these limitations. In this study, the authors identify two areas of improvement through data-driven approaches, including a next destination predictor, based on the delivery fleet's historical global positioning system trajectory data using a non-linear autoregressive neural network, and a road incident detector for real-time ETA improvement. By comparing a range of machine learning classification algorithms for incident detection, XGBoost has been found to be the most practical choice, due to its performance and efficiency.

The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Building alteration; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Topic modeling,"Lai Y., Kontokosta C.E.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101383,0.050000000700000005,-0.6100000143000001,"['urban redevelopment', 'topic modeling', 'unstructured text data', 'building permit data', 'knowledge discovery']"

We propose to examine complex public transit travel patterns over a large-scale transit network, which is challenging since it involves thousands of transit passengers and massive data from heterogeneous sources. Additionally, efficient representation and visualization of discovered travel patterns is difficult given a large number of transit trips. To address these challenges, this study leverages advanced machine learning methods to identify time-varying mobility patterns based on smart card data and other urban data. The proposed approach delivers a comprehensive solution to pre-process, analyze, and visualize complex public transit travel patterns. This approach first fuses smart card data with other urban data to reconstruct original transit trips.We use two machine learning methods, including a clustering algorithm to extract transit corridors to represent primarymobility connections between different regions and a graph-embedding algorithmto discover hierarchical mobility community structures.We also devise compact and effective multi-scale visualization forms to represent the discovered travel behavior dynamics. An interactive web-based mapping prototype is developed to integrate advanced machine learning methods with specific visualizations to characterize transit travel behavior patterns and to enable visual exploration of transit mobility patterns at different scales and resolutions over space and time. The proposed approach is evaluated using multi-source big transit data (e.g., smart card data, transit network data, and bus trajectory data) collected in Shenzhen City, China. Evaluation of our prototype demonstrates that the proposed visual analytics approach offers a scalable and effective solution for discovering meaningful travel patterns across large metropolitan areas. © 2019 by the authors.",Geovisual analytics; Machine learning; Mobility community; Smart card data; Transit corridor; Trip,"Zhang T., Wang J., Cui C., Li Y., He W., Lu Y., Qiao Q.",10.3390/ijgi8110489,8.970000267,-0.9200000167,"['mobility pattern discovery', 'geovisual analytics', 'public transit travel', 'big transit data', 'urban data']"

Although public policy promotes transport alternatives and new infrastructure, traffic congestion is highly prevalent and continues to be the lead cause for numerous social, economic and environmental issues. Although a significant volume of research has been reported on road traffic prediction, profiling of traffic has received much less attention. In this paper we address two key problems in traffic profiling by proposing a novel unsupervised incremental learning approach for road traffic congestion detection and profiling, dynamically over time. This approach uses (a) hyperdimensional computing to enable capture variable-length trajectories of commuter trips represented as vehicular movement across intersections, and (b) transforms these into feature vectors that can be incrementally learned over time by the Incremental Knowledge Acquiring Self-Learning (IKASL) algorithm.

Hundreds of thousands of datasets have been catalogued and can be accessed at data portals at different administrative levels. However, usually, users do not think in terms of datasets when they search for information. Instead, they are interested in information that is most likely scattered across several datasets. In the world of proprietary incompany data, organizations invest heavily in connecting data in knowledge graphs and/or store data in data lakes with the intention of having an integrated view of the data for analysis. With the rise of machine learning, it is a common belief that governments can improve their services, for example, by allowing citizens to get answers related to government information from virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri. To provide high-quality answers, these systems need to be fed with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we share our experience of constructing and using the first open government knowledge graph in the Netherlands.

For centuries, understanding these places has been limited to sporadic observations and laborious data collection. This study proposes a novel methodology to analyze citywide, discrete urban spaces using highly accurate anonymized telecom data and machine learning algorithms. Through superposition of human dynamics and urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users. Geolocated telecom data, obtained for the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify “stay-points”—events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence, and diversity. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify associations between the formation of these clusters and various urban features such as urban morphology or land-use within a 25–50 meters resolution. Some of the urban features that were found to be highly related to the creation of large, diverse and long-lasting clusters were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features, and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have a negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a “reversed urbanism” methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning, and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled as a foundational design tool for inferring the success rates of highly performative urban places. © The Author(s) 2019.",human dynamics; machine learning; spatial analysis; telecom data; Urban design,"Noyman A., Doorley R., Xiong Z., Alonso L., Grignard A., Larson K.",10.1177/2399808319840668,9.9200000763,-1.0399999619,"['Inferring urban performance', 'discrete urban space', 'telecom data', 'human behavioral pattern', 'centrality']"

Thus, it is important to take note of the time where investments in new technologies directed at the safety of the railway enable safety and protection in this area. Novel technological techniques such as big data analysis (BDA), data mining or machine learning (ML) have been developed and applied in many areas such as sales, banking and healthcare. The development of such methods has important benefits within the context of railway safety, however, these new methods need to be implemented and developed with consideration of whether these operational models can help to solve the various difficulties that currently exist in the risk analysis of railway stations. Moreover, as the adoption of the Internet of thing (IoT) grows, it is expected that analytical needs for handling data will also increase. It has been shown that the progression towards automation and applying such innovative new technologies such as BDA may be a powerful tool for integration in the future of transportation in general and the railway industry in particular, whereby analytical predictions can aid in the development of safer railway stations which have greater potential for ensuring the safety of passengers. In this paper a Bow Tie (BT) framework model has been created to combine BDA into the risk assessment process. The BDA can be beneficial to the risk assessment, support the decision makers in real time, and reduce human errors. This method can be fully integrated into passenger data and the business model for the railway station. Employing the existing safety records utilizing BDA is expected to mitigate risks, predict hazards, raise safety and security efficiency and reduce the cost. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Alawad H., Kaewunruen S., Min A.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/5/052031,2.4000000954000003,0.5799999833,"['railway safety', 'big data', 'risk analysis', 'passenger data', 'predict hazard']"

Both methodologies face limitations, with knowledge-based approaches being criticized for scalability and transferability issues and data-driven approaches for lacking interpretability and depending heavily on data quality. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework that fuses a knowledge-based approach using design patterns and a data-driven approach using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in three different ways: Functional regions discovered using either approach are evaluated against each other to identify cases of significant agreement or disagreement; knowledge from patterns is used to adjust topic probabilities in the learning model; and topic probabilities are used to adjust pattern-based results. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated through the use case of identifying shopping-related regions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results show that the combination of pattern-based discovery and topic modeling extraction helps uncover discrepancies between the two approaches and smooth inaccuracies caused by the limitations of each approach. © 2019 by the authors.",Functional region; Patterns; Place; Topic modeling; Urban planning; Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI),"Papadakis E., Gao S., Baryannis G.",10.3390/ijgi8090385,0.1800000072,-0.5799999833,"['latent Dirichlet allocation', 'urban planning', 'design pattern', 'similar region', 'learning model']"

However, most of the available clustering protocols were designed for highways, and thus become unstable in realistic urban environments with many intersections. In this paper, a Clustering Adaptation Near Intersection (CANI) approach is proposed to ensure clustering stability at intersections. This approach exploits Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) to predict the behavior of the vehicles near an intersection and adapt the clusters accordingly. The main advantage of the developed OS-ELM prediction model is its ability to continuously learn and update in real time. After being validated, the proposed adaptation approach is included in a highway clustering scheme. The resultant clustering protocol is compared to other schemes in a realistic urban environment, and shows significant stability and efficiency performance improvement. © 2019 IEEE.",Clustering algorithm; Machine learning; Urban environment; VANET,"Alsuhli G.H., Khattab A., Fahmy Y.A., Massoud Y.",10.1109/ICVES.2019.8906296,16.09,-1.9100000000000001,"['Enhanced urban clustering', 'prediction', 'highway', 'available clustering protocol', 'online machine learning']"

However in many developing countries or cities reliable local-scale socioeconomic data remain scarce. Here we show an easily accessible and timely updated location attribute-restaurant-can be used to accurately predict a range of socioeconomic attributes of urban neighborhoods. We merge restaurant data from an online platform with 3 microdatasets for 9 Chinese cities. Using features extracted from restaurants we train machine-learning models to estimate daytime and nighttime population number of firms and consumption level at various spatial resolutions. The trained model can explain 90 to 95% of the variation of those attributes across neighborhoods in the test dataset. We analyze the tradeoff between accuracy spatial resolution and number of training samples as well as the heterogeneity of the predicted results across different spatial locations demographics and firm industries. Finally we demonstrate the cross-city generality of this method by training the model in one city and then applying it directly to other cities. The transferability of this restaurant model can help bridge data gaps between cities allowing all cities to enjoy big data and algorithm dividends. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Then, a rapid and efficient automation population mapping method was proposed with the support of reconstructed high spatiotemporal resolution of human movements.

Based on the available massive geo-located human data, existing studies focused almost exclusively on the position attributes (i.e. coordinates) of the locations visited by people to explore the relationship, however, they ignored the category attributes (e.g. restaurant or supermarket) of these locations which imply the purposes (e.g. eating or shopping) behind human movements. A location with coordinates and category information is usually referred to as a point-of-interest (POI). In this paper, we study the relationship between POIs-related human mobility and socioeconomic status at city level. Starting from the location-based social network (i.e. Foursquare) dataset, we find that the check-in numbers of location categories are correlated with socioeconomic indicators, either positively or negatively. To further validate these correlations, we develop and test a multi-task prediction framework based on POIs-related human mobility for forecasting socioeconomic indicators. Extensive experiments on the Foursquare dataset show that the socioeconomic indicators can be well predicted by our proposed framework.

Investment on planning and processing of traffic information should help to minimize congestion and pollution. So here we propose a way to design our own road networks as required to reduce traffic using a tool called Sumo. Inorder to find the efficiency of that network, a WSN based framework is designed for the same and various routing schemes are applied on it. A fuzzy logic-based traffic light control system and QOS parameters handling system is designed by extracting data available by routing schemes applied. Inorder to make the roads safer artificial intelligence-based security cameras hoping to achieve automated recognition of people and events is planned. Digital brains map the eyes to analyze live video and helping responders to more easily find crimes and accidents on roads. Machine learning is employed to get considerable gains in its ability to identify objects, the skill of analyzing scenes, activities, and movements. Simulations have shown good performance for the proposed routing schemes and fuzzy controller designed shows good results to the urban traffic network. © 2019 IEEE.",Multiattribute decision-making (MADM); Open street map (OSM); Simple additive weighting product (SAW); Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO); Weighting product (WP),"Vachan B.R., Mishra S.",10.1109/ICCCBDA.2019.8725761,3.5199999808999998,0.3600000143,"['monitoring road traffic', 'deep mind analytics', 'light control system', 'road network', 'security camera']"

In recent years, the prevalence of positioning methods and technologies, such as the global positioning system, cellular radio tower geo-positioning, and WiFi positioning systems, has driven efforts to collect human mobility data and to mine patterns of interest within these data in order to promote the development of location-based services and applications. The efforts to mine significant patterns within large-scale, high-dimensional mobility data have solicited use of advanced analysis techniques, usually based on machine learning methods, and therefore, in this paper, we survey and assess different approaches and models that analyze and learn human mobility patterns using mainly machine learning methods. We categorize these approaches and models in a taxonomy based on their positioning characteristics, the scale of analysis, the properties of the modeling approach, and the class of applications they can serve. We find that these applications can be categorized into three classes: user modeling, place modeling, and trajectory modeling, each class with its characteristics. Finally, we analyze the short-term trends and future challenges of human mobility analysis. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Data mining; Human mobility patterns; Machine learning; Mobile phones,"Toch E., Lerner B., Ben-Zion E., Ben-Gal I.",10.1007/s10115-018-1186-x,9.2600002289,-0.5899999738,"['human mobility data', 'machine learning method', 'WiFi positioning', 'place modeling', 'daily commute pattern']"

To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter, tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424).

Particularly, predicting pedestrian crossings at crosswalks is of considerable importance for avoiding accidents on the one hand and not unnecessarily slowing down traffic on the other hand. Traditional model-based motion tracking and prediction approaches have difficulties in capturing abrupt changes in motions, as humans can perform them. In this paper, an approach for predicting pedestrian motions that combines established motion tracking algorithms with data-driven methods is presented. The approach is built upon a hierarchical structure, where first, the intent of each pedestrian is classified. Then, the approach computes several qualitative metrics, such as time-to-cross, for the pedestrians classified as crossing. The approach is evaluated on a challenging urban data set collected for different types of crosswalks such as roundabouts and straight roads. The evaluation also provides a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed approach. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",Autonomous vehicles; decision making; machine learning; prediction methods,"Volz B., Mielenz H., Gilitschenski I., Siegwart R., Nieto J.",10.1109/TITS.2018.2827956,3.1199998856,-0.0299999993,"['pedestrian motion', 'Robust prediction', 'urban data set', 'autonomous driving', 'roundabout']"

2,0.781378981,387,,2019,Book Chapter,Internet of things and statistical analysis,"Internet of Things (IoT) creates a world where physical objects are integrated into information networks. IoT refers to the connection of devices that transforms a wide range of fields. In medicine, for instance, connected devices can assist medical professionals in monitoring patients inside and outside of hospitals. Practitioners adjust treatments and improve patient outcomes using the produced data. Another field in which a transformation occurs is urban planning. Sensors with an IP address are placed under a busy street, so drivers can be alerted about upcoming delays or accidents. The explosive growth in the number of devices connected to the IoT and the exponential increase in data consumption only reflect how the growth of large data sets is perfectly overlapping with that of IoT. In addition to increased volume, the IoT-generated large data sets exhibit a mixture of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of these data sets is the key to developing smart IoT applications. Since IoT will be among the greatest sources of new data, data science is used to make IoT applications more intelligent. Analysis of these data sets, in practice, is done using various data science techniques. Data science is the compounding of different disciplines of sciences that uses data mining, machine learning, and other techniques to get forms and fresh insights from data. The different algorithms are applied to the information in order to draw out higher-level information from IoT data sets. These techniques include a wide scope of algorithms applied in different domains and comprise both unsupervised and supervised methods. The procedure of applying data analytic methods to particular areas involves data models such as neural networks, classification, clustering methods, and applying efficient algorithms that fit with the data characteristics. In this article, we focus on statistical analysis of the collected data sets and look at the similarities and differences of data mining and statistical methods for IoT systems. By explaining the need for both descriptive and inferential statistical methods, we show the inadequacy of using only unsupervised data mining techniques for IoT data sets. We then concentrate on statistical inference approaches, such as the design-based and model-based inferences, and discuss the role of explanatory versus forecasting statistical models in an IoT environment. Lastly, we demonstrate the danger of making forecasts using only unsupervised techniques by revealing open challenges as future research directions. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Data mining; Descriptive-, explanatory statistical analysis; Design-based-, model-based-inferences; Explanatory-, forecasting models; Unsupervised-, supervised learning",Taşıran A.C.,10.1007/978-3-319-93557-7_8,7.8400001526,-2.4700000286,"['IoT data', 'data mining technique', 'unsupervised data', 'machine learning', 'various data science']"

Recent applications range from humanitarian response and poverty estimation to urban planning and epidemic containment. Yet the vast majority of computational tools and algorithms used in these applications do not account for the multi-view nature of social networks: people are related in myriad ways, but most graph learning models treat relations as binary.

The transportation mode information can help to improve urban planning, traffic management and journey planning. Though much work has been done on the transportation mode recognition using classic machine learning algorithms, the performance of these methods is not reasonable and heavily relies on the effectiveness of handcrafted features. In this paper, we leverage the strong representation ability of deep learning method and present a deep-learning-based algorithm for transportation mode recognition, namely CL-TRANSMODE, which is capable of accurately detecting multiple transportation modes. The algorithm first uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn appropriate and robust feature representations for transportation modes recognition. Then, an LSTM network performs a further learning of the temporal dependencies characteristics on the feature vectors of CNN output. To further enhance the accuracy of transportation mode recognition, several artificial segments and peak features are extracted from the raw sensor measurements. These features characterize the transportation modes over a much long period of time (minutes or hours). By combining the CNN-extracted features and handcrafted features, our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm can accurately differentiate eight transportation modes, i.e., walking, running, bicycling, driving a car, riding a bus, taking a metro, taking a train, or being stationary. Extensive experiments on both the SHL and HTC datasets demonstrate that use our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative algorithms. On the SHL dataset, which contain barometric data, the accuracy using the CL-TRANSMODE algorithm can reaches 98.1%. © 2013 IEEE.",CNN; context-aware; LSTM; Mobile sensing; transportation mode recognition,"Qin Y., Luo H., Zhao F., Wang C., Wang J., Zhang Y.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944686,16.51,-1.05,"['transportation mode recognition', 'LSTM network', 'barometric data', 'deep learning', 'train']"

To monitor the urban environment and facilitate the municipal administration, more and more applications adopt vehicles as participants to carry out MCS tasks. The performance of the applications highly depends on the sensing data which is influenced by the recruiting strategy on vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle selection algorithm to maximize the sensing range with limited cost while the vehicle selection problem was proved to be NP-complete. Specifically, we modeled the interaction between MCS server and candidate vehicles as a Markov decision process and formulated the maximum spatial temporal coverage (STC) optimization as a deep reinforcement learning process.

Analysing and then disseminating the behaviours and other factors underpinning positive deviance are demonstrably effective in delivering development results. However, positive deviance faces a number of challenges that are restricting its diffusion. In this paper, using a systematic literature review, we analyse the current state of positive deviance and the potential for big data to address the challenges facing positive deviance. From this, we evaluate the promise of “big data-based positive deviance”: This would analyse typical sources of big data in developing countries—mobile phone records, social media, remote sensing data, etc—to identify both positive deviants and the factors underpinning their superior performance. While big data cannot solve all the challenges facing positive deviance as a development tool, they could reduce time, cost, and effort; identify positive deviants in new or better ways; and enable positive deviance to break out of its current preoccupation with public health into domains such as agriculture, education, and urban planning.

Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level.

Based on the revised models, model stacking is used which can boost predictive accuracy by combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models. The experiments show that, when the metrics are specified, the revised models outperform the traditional ones.

In this article, we proposed transportation modes classification method based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to discover seven kinds of transportation modes from GPS trajectory data, including walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a taxi, driving a car, taking the subway and taking a train. First, the original trajectories must be divided into some sub trajectories. There is only one transportation mode label in each sub trajectory. Second, the feature vector of sub trajectory is computed including eight basic and three advanced features. These basic features are distance feature, five velocity-related features and two acceleration-related features. Three advanced features are heading change rate (hcr), stop rate (sr) and velocity change rate (vcr), Final, the LightGBM classifier is used to detect the transportation modes automatically.

Finding repeating dynamical patterns is important in understanding freight behaviors, and aids freight-friendly planning. In the digital age, data on truck drivers is becoming more available with heterogeneous demographic and work profiles. By synthesizing such pervasive data and applying machine learning concepts, this paper proposes to identify signature travel activity patterns via dimensionality reduction. Based on driver survey data, truck drivers’ behaviors are represented as longitudinal activity sequences. Dimensionality reduction and activity reconstruction via principal components analysis (PCA), logistic PCA, and autoencoder were conducted to reveal fundamental activity features and approximate the underlying data-generating function. In the driver survey dataset, 243 truck drivers in Singapore reported their daily activities for 1,099 weekdays. This study found that PCA produced the most faithful reconstruction of drivers’ activities. When projecting the input data down from 2,592 to 82 dimensions, PCA explained 77% of variances with a reconstruction error of 0.99%. Logistic PCA is a useful extension of PCA to study the pattern of a single activity. It captures the variation of infrequent activities such as truck queuing, which PCA fails to reconstruct. Autoencoder was found to be more powerful than PCA in reconstructing activities – with 1% of original dimensions, it reconstructed the activities with an error rate of 1.24%. Moreover, when implemented as a variational autoencoder, autoencoder generated realistic-looking samples of driver activities.

This study bridges in-situ observations of pedestrian activity and urban computing by integrating high-resolution, large-scale, and heterogeneous urban datasets and analyzing both fixed attributes of the urban landscape (e.g. physical and transit infrastructure) with dynamic environmental and socio-psychological factors, such as weather, air quality, and perceived crime risk. We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial–temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year. The results provide insights into the key drivers of local pedestrian activity and highlight the importance accounting for the immediate urban environment and socio-spatial dynamics in pedestrian behavior modeling. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Pedestrian mobility; Urban computing; Urban data; Urban planning; Walkability,"Lai Y., Kontokosta C.E.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.08.018,9.8500003815,-0.8600000143000001,"['impact pedestrian activity', 'heterogeneous urban datasets', 'analyze place', 'urban walkability', 'pedestrian count data']"

With the rise of ubiquitous computing, there is the opportunity to improve such models with data that make for better proxies of human presence in cities. In this paper, we leverage large human mobility data to craft an extensive set of features for crime prediction, as informed by theories in criminology and urban studies. We employ averaging and boosting ensemble techniques from machine learning, to investigate their power in predicting yearly counts for different types of crimes occurring in New York City at census tract level. Our study shows that spatial and spatio-temporal features derived from Foursquare venues and checkins, subway rides, and taxi rides, improve the baseline models relying on census and POI data. The proposed models achieve absolute R2 metrics of up to 65% (on a geographical out-of-sample test set) and up to 89% (on a temporal out-of-sample test set). This proves that, next to the residential population of an area, the ambient population there is strongly predictive of the area’s crime levels. We deep-dive into the main crime categories, and find that the predictive gain of the human dynamics features varies across crime types: such features bring the biggest boost in case of grand larcenies, whereas assaults are already well predicted by the census features. Furthermore, we identify and discuss top predictive features for the main crime categories. These results offer valuable insights for those responsible for urban policy or law enforcement. © 2018, The Author(s).",Applied machine learning; Crime prediction; Human mobility; Location-based social networks; Spatio-temporal data; Urban computing,"Kadar C., Pletikosa I.",10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0150-z,1.7200000286,-0.6100000143000001,"['crime prediction', 'human mobility data', 'top predictive feature', 'urban study', 'machine learning']"

Current approaches are mostly data-driven, based on machine learning approaches. However, machine learning models require substantial training data and cannot explain the reasoning procedure. Data-driven approaches also fall short while interpreting trajectories where ground truth information is limited. Therefore, this paper develops a novel knowledge-based approach for interpreting smartphone global positioning system trajectories by detecting various transport modes used during travel. The proposed model is based on an expert system that can work without any training, based solely on expert knowledge. Core is a fuzzy multiple-input multiple-output expert system using kinematic and spatial information with a well explained fuzzy reasoning scheme through a fuzzy rule base. The model can provide alternate predictions with varied certainty factors. Different membership function combinations have been evaluated in terms of accuracy and ambiguity, and the result demonstrates that the model performs best using a Gaussian–Gaussian combination, comparable to the existing machine learning approaches. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",Activity; expert system; fuzzy logic; GPS; mobility; smartphone; trajectory; transport mode; travel; uncertainty,"Das R.D., Winter S.",10.1080/15472450.2018.1436968,2.6700000763,-0.6299999952,"['intelligent transportation system', 'fuzzy reasoning', 'smartphone global positioning', 'mode detection', 'spatial information']"
2,0.781378981,434,40.0,2018,Article,Citizen-centered big data analysis-driven governance intelligence framework for smart cities,"Sensors and systems within rapidly expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China.

Further, we developed a knowledge-based algorithm for a knowledge learning system. The algorithm learns to classify coordinates (unlabeled) into regions. Consequently, dividing routing calculations into regions (clusters) provides many benefits over traditional methods, and can result in an improvement in routing cost over the traditional company method by up to 25.68% and over the classical GA by up to 8.10%. It is also shown that our proposed method can reduce traveling distance compared to previous methods.

4,0.9110942155,438,5.0,2018,Article,Game-based crowdsourcing to support collaborative customization of the definition of sustainability,"Successful adoption and management of sustainable urban systems hinges on the community embracing these systems. Capturing citizens’ ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens’ inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Computational linguistic; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Social media; Sustainability; Urban infrastructure,"Nik Bakht M., El-Diraby T.E., Hossaini M.",10.1016/j.aei.2018.08.019,0.4199999869,0.1599999964,"['unstructured community input', 'sustainable urban system', 'sentiment analysis result', 'topic hierarchy', 'social network analytics']"

Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems are conventional methods for vehicle detection and travel times estimation. However, such systems are specifically focused on car plates, providing a limited extent of road users. The advance of open-source deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) in combination with freely-available closed-circuit television (CCTV) datasets have offered the opportunities for detection and classification of various road users. The research, presented here, aims to analyse traffic flow patterns through fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models on domain-specific low quality imagery, as captured in various weather conditions and seasons of the year 2018. Such imagery is collected from the North East Combined Authority (NECA) Travel and Transport Data, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Results show that the fine-tuned MobileNet model with 98.2% precision, 58.5% recall and 73.4% harmonic mean could potentially be used for a real time traffic monitoring application with big data, due to its fast performance. Compared to MobileNet, the fine-tuned Faster region proposal R-CNN model, providing a better harmonic mean (80.4%), recall (68.8%) and more accurate estimations of car units, could be used for traffic analysis applications that demand higher accuracy than speed.

However, with the increased number of vehicles in urban areas these algorithms may have reached their limitation due to the huge increase in the state space in a limited computing power and memory environment. In this research we will introduce a dynamic routing system for traffic in intersections based on real-time traffic conditions such as individual vehicle speed, destination and traffic light status to provide the fasted path between a source and a target point.

Traffic control has been shown to be a means of maintaining road serviceability with a key input being traffic inference. The harvesting of sufficiently large data sets for traffic inference has thus far been a challenge examined by the scientific community. A modelling, interactive design approach to the harvesting and preprocessing of vehicular data can be used to bridge the gap for traffic control to be autonomously implementable in an urban context. With this consideration, this paper explores the implementation of an internet of things multiagent system, in a network and equipped with sensors, distributed along the roadway to collect and share this vehicular data among its nodes and then process the data using a machine learning algorithm for learning and subsequent inference of vehicular types. An interactive design approach is used in the creation of a reduced model of knowledge from each node’s bulk harvested data, which is then easily stored or deployed and which also facilitates post-processing of data. Considering the smart city as a product, the interactive approach to product engineering permits the implementation of these mathematical models as part of an interactive traffic control system, to ensure the city’s adaptability to the ever-changing needs of its inhabitants. In this paper, we present the analysis of the trivial case of the detection of presence and absence of a class A type vehicle. In the introductory section, we examine the problem of transportation in urban expansion. In section two, we examine the solution provided by the Smart Cities with respect to transport services. Further problems which appear within these transport services and their respective solutions in machine learning and the internet of things are discussed in this section on these disruptive technologies. Section three examines the bibliography for successes achieved with similar research and also demonstrates the basis for classification by support vector machines.

Enhancing human mobility prediction using local functions based on public records and SNS data,"The quality of life for people in urban regions can be improved by predicting urban human mobility and adjusting urban planning accordingly. In this study, we compared several possible variables to verify whether a gravity model (a human mobility prediction model borrowed from Newtonian mechanics) worked as well in inner-city regions as it did in intra-city regions. We reviewed the resident population, the number of employees, and the number of SNS posts as variables for generating mass values for an urban traffic gravity model. We also compared the straight-line distance, travel distance, and the impact of time as possible distance values. We defined the functions of urban regions on the basis of public records and SNS data to reflect the diverse social factors in urban regions. In this process, we conducted a dimension reduction method for the public record data and used a machine learning-based clustering algorithm for the SNS data. In doing so, we found that functional distance could be defined as the Euclidean distance between social function vectors in urban regions. Finally, we examined whether the functional distance was a variable that had a significant impact on urban human mobility. © 2018 Kim et al.

5,0.9110942155,461,32.0,2018,Article,Hierarchical multi-agent control of traffic lights based on collective learning,"Increasing traffic congestion poses significant challenges for urban planning and management in metropolitan areas around the world. One way to tackle the problem is to resort to the emerging technologies in artificial intelligence. Traffic light control is one of the most traditional and important instruments for urban traffic management. The present study proposes a traffic light control system enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework in a decentralized manner. In the framework, a traffic network is decomposed into regions represented by region agents. Each region consists of intersections, modeled by intersection agents who coordinate with neighboring intersection agents through communication. For each intersection, a collection of turning movement agents operate individually and implement optimal actions according to local control policies. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm for each turning movement agent, the intersection controllers are enabled with the capability to make their timing decisions in a complex and dynamic environment. In addition, the traffic light control operates with an advanced phase composition process dynamically combining compatible turning movements. Moreover, the collective operations performed by the agents in a road network are further coordinated by varying priority settings for relevant turning movements. A case study was carried out by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed control system while comparing it with an optimized vehicle-actuated control system. The results show that the proposed traffic light system, after a collective machine learning process, not only improves the local signal operations at individual intersections but also enhances the traffic performance at the regional level through coordination of specific turning movements. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Collective machine learning; Decentralized system; Hierarchical model of traffic system; Learning-based control; Multi-agent traffic light control,"Jin J., Ma X.",10.1016/j.engappai.2017.10.013,3.5499999523,-0.050000000700000005,"['urban traffic management', 'collective learning', 'light control system', 'intersection agent', 'traffic light']"

We have further developed a person detection method and introduced a person tracker as an intermediate stage between person detection and anomaly detection. The method is presented together with results from evaluations based on real sensor data that have been recorded in a realistic urban environment. Several scenarios have been recorded such as normal situations, a person loitering, a person shooting and people escaping from sudden smoke development. The method uses sensor data from a static video surveillance system, consisting of two visual and two thermal infrared cameras. The person detection method combines foreground segmentation with a trained machine learning algorithm which is based on boosting. The tracker associates incoming detections to objects (i.e. people), and generates tracks of world coordinates and velocities of objects. The anomaly detection method, which is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), fuses information that is derived from the tracker. The information contains a number of persons, their positions and velocities. The results indicate that the person detection method in combination with the tracker can produce robust and accurate observations to the HMM, which in turn provide good conditions for accurate anomaly detection. © 2018 SPIE.",Anomaly detection; Camera network; Hidden Markov model; Information fusion,"Andersson M., Hemström F., Molin S.",10.1117/12.2326276,2.6800000668,0.2099999934,"['video surveillance', 'anomaly detection method', 'hidden Markov model', 'real sensor data', 'person detection method']"

Recently, researchers try to discover the region functions with the human mobility data based on machine learning and statistical models.

In this paper, we will address the problem by integrating multi-domain data, like human trajectories, base station information and Points-of-Interest attributes.

This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates both state-of-art machine learning techniques and well-established traffic flow theory to estimate citywide traffic volume. In addition to typical urban context features extracted from multiple sources, we extract a special set of features from GPS trajectories based on the implications of traffic flow theory, which provide extra information on the speed-flow relationship. Using the network-wide speed information estimated from a travel speed estimation model, a volume related high level feature is first learned using an unsupervised graphical model.

Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment. For decades they have learned how to use census data, which is comprehensive on several basic variables, but is only conducted once per decade so is almost always out of date. More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009). Planners are still being trained in methods that are suitable for a data poor environment (J Plan Educ Res 6:10–21, 1986; Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data: the big data revolution!, 101–104, 2011; J Plan Educ Res 15:17–33, 1995). In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape. We will discuss how these methods can be integrated into the planning curriculum as well as planning practice. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Analytics; Big data; Education; Urban planning; Visualization,"French S.P., Barchers C., Zhang W.",10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_12,16.12,1.4100000000000001,"['Urban planning', 'big data revolution', 'data rich landscape', 'census data', 'data mining']"

A lot of rich information comes in textual forms, which traditionally have to be read manually. With advancements in machine learning capabilities, there is potential to tap on it to aid planners in synthesizing insights from large amount of textual feedback data more efficiently. In this paper, we developed a more general urban-centric feedback analysis framework, which encompasses the spatio-temporal thematic of ground sensing. Three essential methods: geotagging, topic modeling, and trend analysis are proposed and a prototype has been implemented. The results of experiments indicate that the proposed framework could not only accurately extract precise geospatial information, but also efficiently analyze the semantic themes based on a probabilistic topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Importantly, the spatial and temporal trends of detected topics indicate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and then benefit domain experts in their routine work and reveal many interesting insights on ground sensing matters. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Geotagging; Spatio-temporal analysis; Topic modeling; Urban planning,"Chen G., Yu L., Ng W.S., Wu H., Kunasegaran U.N.",10.1007/978-3-319-69179-4_56,0.4399999976,-0.4399999976,"['topic modeling', 'urban ground sensing', 'thematic analytics framework', 'geotagging', 'textual feedback data']"

But these two systems dedicated to end user and road traffic management authorities could also benefits from other information, and particularly from parking availability prediction since cruising for parking spot represents a significant part of urban traffic: When looking for a parking, drivers must guess where to go, and if they are wrong, may face long distances to find the next location, resulting in considerable time loss and a worsening of traffic congestion. We focus on the simultaneous prediction of traffic and parking availability. Our approach relay on machine learning techniques and more precisely on representation learning methods: Each road and car-park is represented by a vector in a common large dimensional space which captures both structural and dynamical information about the observed phenomenon. Such a model is thus able to jointly capture the spatio-Temporal correlations between parking and traffic resulting in a high performance prediction system.

Both applications rely on the sensor traces generated by travellers’ smartphones. These traces can be used to interpret travel modes, both for generating automated travel diaries as well as for real-time travel mode detection. Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also, segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the location traces. In order to address all these challenges a novel, state based bottom-up approach is proposed. This approach assumes a fixed atomic segment of a homogeneous state, instead of an event-based segment, and a progressive iteration until a new state is found. The research investigates how an atomic state-based approach can be developed in such a way that can work in real time, near-real time and offline mode and in different environmental conditions with their varying quality of sensor traces. The results show the proposed bottom-up model outperforms the existing event-based segmentation models in terms of adaptivity, flexibility, accuracy and richness in information delivery pertinent to automated travel behavior interpretation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Activity; Context; GPS; IMU; MaaS; Machine learning; Temporal calculi; Trajectory; Trip,"Das R.D., Winter S.",10.3390/s16111962,2.3800001144,-0.9399999976000001,"['travel behavior interpretation', 'trajectory segmentation', 'Automated urban travel', 'activity transition', 'location trace']"

Getting accurate routing instructions, finding parking spots, receiving customized information that helps individual drivers reach their destination will significantly reduce the stress of driving, save fuel and reduce unnecessary delays and pollution levels. In this paper we present a system that combines smart navigation with intelligent parking assist and driver diagnostics to considerably improve driving comfort, safety and mobility in an urban environment. The smart navigation employs an on line traffic simulator which provides traffic predictions and improves the accuracy of existing navigation systems which rely on limited traffic data. The intelligent parking assist system predicts the availability of parking at the start of the journey and these predictions get updated as the destination is approached. The system uses machine learning to understand the habits and preferences of the individual driver so that the preferred parking availability information is presented to the driver. The driver diagnostics part learns the driving characteristics of the driver i.e. whether aggressive, semi aggressive or passive, reaction times, following distances etc. and provides this information to the smart navigation and parking assist system for better estimation of travel times. In addition, it can be used to support collision warnings and other driver assist devices.

Thus, the development and deployment of various aspects of IoT-based applications are necessary to mine the potential value of data to the benefit of people and their lives. However, the variety, volume, heterogeneity, and real-time nature of data obtained from smart cities pose considerable challenges.

The effective travel speed is typically assumed to be an empirical constant. We test whether this simplifying assumption is justified empirically.

While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

Early recognition and prediction of behavioral patterns are of great importance in many societal applications like urban planning, transportation optimization, and health-care. Understanding the relationships between human behaviors and location’s context is an emerging interest for understanding human-environmental dynamics. Growing availability of Web 2.0, i.e. the increasing amount of websites with mainly user created content and social platforms opens up an opportunity to study such location’s contexts. This paper investigates relationships existing between human behavior and location context, by analyzing log mobile phone data records. First an advanced approach to categorize areas in a city based on the presence and distribution of categories of human activity (e.g., eating, working, and shopping) found across the areas, is proposed. The proposed classification is then evaluated through its comparison with the patterns of temporal variation of mobile phone activity and applying machine learning techniques to predict a timeline type of communication activity in a given location based on the knowledge of the obtained category vs. land-use type of the locations areas. The proposed classification turns out to be more consistent with the temporal variation of human communication activity, being a better predictor for those compared to the official land use classification. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2016.",Big data; Cell phone data records; Clustering algorithms; Geospatial data; Human activity recognition; Human behavior; Knowledge management; Land-use; Supervised learning algorithms,"Dashdorj Z., Sobolevsky S.",10.1007/978-3-662-53416-8_10,17.72,0.44,"['mobile phone activity', 'land use classification', 'location context', 'machine learning technique', 'data']"

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques. A prototype implementation of layer is presented in a simulated validation scenario. The prototype allows an expert user to monitor threat probabilities for different physical environments, and influence the sensitivity of these environments in real-time as well as and provide feedback for adapting the machine learning models. © 2014 IEEE.",predictive reasoning; stream processing; urban terrorist indicators,"Archetti F., Djordjevic D., Giordani I., Sormani R., Tisato F.",10.1109/CCST.2014.6987009,2.2400000095,0.1000000015,"['terrorist attack prediction', 'reasoning layer', 'event processing system', 'intelligence analyst work', 'sensitive threat event']"

In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using techniques from machine learning and data mining to determine the future vacancy risks for individual properties and for neighborhoods using a variety of structural, demographic, socioeconomic, and city activity features with high accuracy. Within a larger systems-of-systems framework that we develop, these predictive analytics will allow a city to move from decision-making based on 'educated anecdotes' and reactive strategies aimed at the most urgent need, to policy development based on informed, holistic insight and proactive interventions that prevent and reverse decline. A demonstration of the use of predictive analytics within the sociotechnical system is provided using data from Syracuse, New York. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Predictive analytics; Property vacancy; Systems of systems; Urban planning,"Appel S.U., Botti D., Jamison J., Plant L., Shyr J.Y., Varshney L.R.",10.1016/j.techfore.2013.08.028,16.57,1.3599999999999999,"['Predictive analytics', 'property vacancy', 'sociotechnical system', 'city activity', 'data']"

Novel analytical approaches for understanding and structuring mobility data are now required to support the backend of a new generation of space-time GIS systems. It is increasingly important as GIS is becoming a decision support platform for operations in fleet management, urban data analysis and related applications. This paper applies the machine learning method of probabilistic topic modelling for semantic enrichment of mobility data recorded in terms of trip counts by using geo-referenced social media data. It further explores the questions of causality and correlation, as well as predictability of the obtained semantic decompositions of mobility flows on a real dataset from a bike sharing network. © 2013 ACM.",semantic decomposition; smart cities; topic modelling; urban mobility,"Coffey C., Pozdnoukhov A.",10.1145/2536689.2536806,17.4,0.19,"['Mobility data', 'probabilistic topic', 'semantic decomposition', 'bike', 'urban data analysis']"

During the past few years, the analysis of mobile phone usage patterns, or of social media with longitudinal attributes, have aided the automatic characterization of the dynamics of the urban environment. In this work, we combine a dataset sourced from a telecommunication provider in Spain with a database of millions of geo-tagged venues from Foursquare and we formulate the problem of urban activity inference in a supervised learning framework. In particular, we exploit user communication patterns observed at the base station level in order to predict the activity of Foursquare users who checkin-in at nearby venues. First, we mine a set of machine learning features that allow us to encode the input telecommunication signal of a tower. Subsequently, we evaluate a diverse set of supervised learning algorithms using labels extracted from Foursquare place categories and we consider two application scenarios. Initially, we assess how hard it is to predict specific urban activity of an area, showing that Nightlife and Entertainment spots are those easier to infer, whereas College and Shopping areas are those featuring the lowest accuracy rates. Then, considering a candidate set of activity types in a geographic area, we aim to elect the most prominent one. We demonstrate how the difficulty of the problem increases with the number of classes incorporated in the prediction task, yet the classifiers achieve a considerably better performance compared to a random guess even when the set of candidate classes increases. © 2013 IEEE.",cellular data; location-based services; urban mining,"Noulas A., Mascolo C., Frias-Martinez E.",10.1109/MDM.2013.27,17.42,0.64,"['urban activity inference', 'Foursquare user', 'phone usage pattern', 'classifier', 'activity recommendation']"

Being widespread, less cost of energy and almost free for collecting data make mobile phone a perfect location sensor probe. Meaningful location name rather than digital coordinates could provide much more valuable information. In this paper, we develop a location semantic predicting method referred to Location Annotation(LA) which can automatically annotate meaningful base stations of phone users with semantic tags such as 'home', 'work place' and 'club'. We extract several explicit features from phone records and spatial-temporal patterns of mobile phone users to build an annotation model based on Maximum Entropy Model. Then a machine learning method is presented to estimate the best configuration of parameters in the model. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate good performance of our method. Overall accuracy is about 90% which outperforms simple and traditional classification methods by 10+%. Semantic location names are valuable to urban planning and optimization, transportation management and land use planning. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Huang W., Li M., Hu W., Song G., Xie K.",10.1109/FSKD.2013.6816332,17.61,0.48,"['location semantic predicting', 'phone record', 'classification method', 'urban planning', 'annotation model']"

As a side effect of this digitalization, large amounts of data -digital footprints- can be sensed and analyzed to uncover patterns of human urban behavior and to augment the city experience of its citizens. In my talk, I will introduce the main concepts, opportunities and challenges in the emerging area of urban computing/smart cities, which focuses on improving the quality of life of an urban environment by understanding the city dynamics through the data provided by ubiquitous technologies. This is a human-centric, data-rich area that spans multiple disciplines, including sociology, computer science and urban planning. From a computer science perspective, there are challenges in a variety of domains, including data visualization, storage, security, privacy, machine learning, data mining and pattern recognition. Some of the applications of smart cities include traffic forecasting, modeling of the spread of biological viruses, urban and transportation design and location-based services. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,Oliver N.,10.1007/978-3-642-25446-8_2,16.35,0.58,"['Urban computing', 'aggregated human behavior', 'traffic forecasting', 'human urban behavior', 'data visualization']"
