from machine learning and computer vision to gather information about the presence and quality of sidewalk in map image .', 'In particular , we identify sidewalk segment in street view image using a random forest classifier , utilizing a set of local and global feature that include geometric context , presence of lane , pixel color , and location .', 'Our result illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segment in a large set of street view image .', 'This algorithm can be easily extended to other datasets , and can be automated to gather complete , fine-grained detail about sidewalk for arbitrarily large urban environment .', 'Visual gaze analysis of robotic pedestrian moving in urban space .', 'This study is founded on the idea that an analysis of the visual gaze dynamic of pedestrian can increase our understanding of how important architectural feature in urban environment are perceived by pedestrian .', 'The result of such an analysis can lead to improvement in urban design .', 'However , a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrian recorded on video .', 'High noise level and the subtlety of human gaze dynamic hamper precise calculation .', 'However , as robot can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than human , this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment .', 'For this study , a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robot of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrian .', 'The experiment compare the input from several camera as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive object .', ""Overhead recording and the robot 's internal joint signal are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing ."", 'A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional ( 3D ) head direction of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vector obtained from video sequence .', 'We briefly describe how the obtained multidimensional trajectory data can be analysed by using a temporal behaviour analysis technique based on support vector machine that was developed separately .']"
