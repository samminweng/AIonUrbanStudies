confirmed by the report of electric grid company ."", 'In some case , there is a 3-fold difference .', 'This occurs due to the emergence of a sustainable culture of electricity consumption and the use of highly energy-efficient device .', 'In 2019 , the result of the research work were taken into account in the regional urban planning standard of the Republic of Tatarstan .', 'On average , the normative value have been reduced by 2 time .', 'This enabled a significant reduction in the difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity .', ""From 2020 onwards , leading construction company in the Republic of Tatarstan are applying up-to-date value to decrease utility service ' construction cost ."", ""For power grid company the saving consist of reduction of electrical energy loss and 'locked electrical capacity ' and the elimination of inefficient investment ."", 'It is important to note that specific value of electrical load were calculated taking into

one 's sense of connection to their neighborhood ."", ""Urban livability is often measured based on various measurable aspect such as stability , healthcare , culture and environment , education , and infrastructure as stated in EIU 's Global Liveability Ranking ."", ""However , these indicator often neglect the nature and process by which place are made that form people 's sense of place much more than the physical availability of urban amenity ."", 'Therefore , this paper aims to analyze the critical perspective and contribution that placemaking brings to the measure of urban livability .', 'This theoretical study analyzes key concept and framework from secondary data such as report and journal paper with the inductive content analysis method .', 'Through the lens of placemaking

not well-organized and taken into consideration in the strategic development plan of the host city , may be a burden on the city .', 'Site selection for the event is considered one of the main critical decision to assure the possibility of the host of the Games by the city .', 'Therefore , this paper reviews several case study that proved its success in location choice under the delivery of sustainable urban design and strategic planning for the host city .', 'It attempts to mention the main urban design element affected by the preparation process .', 'Consequently , an urban design
