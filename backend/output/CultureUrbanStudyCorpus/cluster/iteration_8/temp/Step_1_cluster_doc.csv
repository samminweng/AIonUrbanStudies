also brings optimism into urban design practice , offering new insight into how to record mosaic of an area in an Indian city that will capture the strong perceived and conceived imagery of a place

planning was distinguished from the more functional planning for art and culture within amenity , heritage , land use and economic resource planning system .', 'The ‘ cultural turn ’ in town and

Ellis 2004 ) .', 'Different approach and rationale for cultural planning have therefore emerged , rather than a single grand theory or conceptual model ( see also Bianchini , Chapter 22 , this volume
