Calculation of the incidence of typhoid fever during preschool years is important to define the optimum age of immunisation and the choice of vaccines for public-health programmes in developing countries. Hospital-based studies have suggested that children younger than 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever, but this view needs to be re-examined in community-based longitudinal studies. We undertook a prospective follow-up study of residents of a low-income urban area of Delhi, India, with active surveillance for case detection. Methods. A baseline census was undertaken in 1995. Between Nov 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 1996, we visited 8172 residents of 1820 households in Kalkaji, Delhi, twice weekly to detect febrile cases. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings. 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases were detected. Of these, 28 (44%) were in children aged under 5 years. The incidence rate of typhoid per 1000 person-years was 27.3 at age under 5 years, 11.7 at 5-19 years, and 1.1 between 19 and 40 years. The difference in the incidence of typhoid fever between those under 5 years and those aged 5-19 years (15.6 per 1000 person-years [95% CI 4.7-26.5]), and those aged 19-40 years (26.2 [16.0-36.3]) was significant (p < 0.001 far both). The difference between the incidence of typhoid at 5-19 years and the incidence at 19-40 years was also significant (10.6 [6.3-14.8], p < 0 001). Morbidity in those under 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and need for hospital admission. Interpretation. Our findings challenge the common view that typhoid fever is a disorder of school-age children and of adults. Typhoid is a common and significant cause of morbidity between 1 and 5 years of age. The optimum age of typhoid immunisation and the choice of vaccines needs to be reassessed.This study was conducted to measure the incidence of typhoid fever among preschoolers. It was suggested that children aged 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever. However, it is important to re-examine this view, particularly in infants and young children in the low-income urban area of Delhi, India, through active surveillance. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings revealed 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases, about 44% of which were in children under 5 years of age. Morbidity in children under age 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and the need for hospital admission. The incidence of typhoid fever and the age distribution of the case varied between developing countries. Thus, the age patterns of typhoid fever observed in the urban study area may differ in rural areas within India or in other developing countries. A reevaluation of the optimum age and vaccine of choice is needed.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sinha A., Sazawal S., Kumar R., Sood S., Reddaiah V.P., Singh B., Rao M., Naficy A., Clemens J.D., Bhan M.K.","DOI":"10.1016\/S0140-6736(98)09001-1","x":1.5599999428,"y":5.5399999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":5,"Cited by":216.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Ten questions on the soundscapes of the built environment","Abstract":"Soundscape research represents a paradigm shift from noise control policies towards a new multidisciplinary approach as it involves not only physical measurements but also the cooperation of humanity and social sciences to account for the diversity of soundscapes across countries and cultures, with more focus on how people actually experience the acoustic environments; and it considers environmental sounds as a 'resource' rather than a 'waste'.

During the past two decades, rapid urbanisation and the conversion of rural land for urban development have led to numerous social conflicts and tensions between the Chinese government and its people. SIA and public participation in development decisions have received increasing attention from the Chinese authorities as possible ways to tackle the problem. Based on a Guangzhou case study, this paper argues that the assessment and mitigation of adverse impacts on the community from urban development have been carried out with different objectives, core values and principles when compared with those in Western societies. It concludes that the poor prospects of SIA and collaborative planning in China lie not only in the weak framework for environmental legislation, but also in all institutions concerning state-society relations, the socialist governing ideology and traditional Chinese culture. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Singapore has undergone rapid urbanization after its independence in 1965, with a concomitant decline in natural habitat extent and accessibility. Using coastal mangrove forests as a case study habitat, changing cultural values were explored with a novel array of techniques, including qualitative archival analysis (photographs, oral histories), current sources (publically uploaded social media photographs), and surveys of (a) the general public and (b) visitors to publically accessible mangroves. Cultural value changed through time, with a significant transition from intrinsic, intrapersonal values (spiritual, cultural heritage) to instrumental, interpersonal values (recreation, education). Additionally, cultural value varied between different mangroves depending on their public accessibility, and the evolving degree of human interaction with the ecosystem as urban development occured. Cultural values change as development transitions, though mangroves still play an important cultural role in a heavily urbanized environment. \u00a9 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Author Keywords":"Coastal; Ecosystem services; Mangrove; Recreation; Singapore; Urbanization","Authors":"Thiagarajah J., Wong S.K.M., Richards D.R., Friess D.A.","DOI":"10.1007\/s13280-015-0647-7","x":2.0399999619,"y":8.4099998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":26,"Cited by":60.0,"Year":1994,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Reading landscape meanings: State constructions and lived experiences in Singapore's Chinatown","Abstract":"The term 'landscape\" embodies multiple levels of meaning: it articulates the ideological intent of the powerful who plan or shape the landscape in particular ways and at the same time reflects the everyday meanings implicit in the daily routines of ordinary people associated with the landscape. Through an analysis of four themes constituting the landscape of Singapore's Chinatown, we unpack two different but interdependent versions of landscape reality: the construction of social meanings from the state's perspective and those derived from the lived experiences of Chinatown's inhabitants. In our first theme, we explore the multiplicity of meanings invested in Chinatown's housing landscape. For the state, urban renewal and public housing schemes in Chinatown represent the redrawing of landscapes along modernist lines informed by efficiency and rationality of land use, in tandem with the larger goals of nation-building. Among residents, however, the vision of modern living in everyday life was only a reality for a few; others experience the landscape in more contradictory ways. Second, in the landscape of community building, we show that state-initiated efforts at inculcating a sense of community have replaced the old spontaneous, interpersonal ties and the strength of organised vernacular associations. Inadvertently, these state strategies have in some ways actually been damaging and deleterious to community ties. In our third theme, we show how the state has, to a large extent, successfully rewritten the socially and physically polluted landscapes of Chinatown. Yet, there are examples of resistances where the state's vision of an unpolluted landscape has been punctured. Since the mid-1980s, a fourth imperative has emerged in the state's management of the Chinatown landscape in the form of attempts to conserve the landscape as a \"historic district\", a repository of the nation's tradition, history and culture. We show that there are different interpretations of the state's effort to revitalise Chinese culture in the conserved landscape and its attempt to cast Chinatown in the role of a \"common bond place\" for all Singaporeans. Singapore's Chinatown is thus a multicoded landscape inscribed with a multiplicity of meanings. It is neither used entirely as an ideological tool for manipulative ends nor does it fully embody the authenticity of daily experiences. \u00a9 1994.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Yeoh B.S.A., Kong L.","DOI":"10.1016\/0197-3975(94)90015-9","x":1.6799999475,"y":7.8699998856},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":27,"Cited by":55.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Moving young lives: Mobility, immobility and inter-generational tensions in urban Africa","Abstract":"This paper explores young people's experiences and perceptions of mobility and mobility constraints in poorer urban areas of Ghana, Malawi and South Africa within the specific context of inter-generational relations.

Indeed, years of cooperative urban planning between developers and those interested in ecology and habitability have transformed Portland from a provincial western city into an exemplary American metropolis. Its thriving downtown, its strong neighborhoods, and its pioneering efforts at local management have brought a steady procession of journalists, scholars, and civic leaders to investigate the \u201cPortland style\u201d that values dialogue and consensus, treats politics as a civic duty, and assumes that it is possible to work toward public good. Probing behind the press clippings, acclaimed urban historian Carl Abbott examines the character of contemporary Portland-its people, politics, and public life-and the region\u2019s history and geography in order to discover how Portland has achieved its reputation as one of the most progressive and livable cities in the United States and to determine whether typical pressures of urban growth are pushing Portland back toward the national norm. In Greater Portland, Abbott argues that the city cannot be understood without reference to its place. Its rivers, hills, and broader regional setting have shaped the economy and the cityscape. Portlanders are Oregonians, Northwesteners, Cascadians; they value their city as much for where it is as for what it is, and this powerful sense of place nurtures a distinctive civic culture. Tracing the ways in which Portlanders have talked and thought about their city, Abbott reveals the tensions between their diverse visions of the future and plans for development. Most citizens of Portland desire a balance between continuity and change, one that supports urban progress but actively monitors its effects on the region\u2019s expansive green space and on the community\u2019s culture. This strong civic participation in city planning and politics is what gives greater Portland its unique character, a positive setting for class integration, neighborhood revitalization, and civic values. The result, Abbott confirms, is a region whose unique initiatives remain a model of American urban planning. \u00a9 2001 University of Pennsylvania Press.

Derelict waterfronts and ageing neighbourhoods have been given new life, enjoying their reincarnation as landscapes of economy and leisure. A prevalent theme in Singapore's transformation has been the reclamation of landscapes to cater to new users, activities and agendas. Adopting a case study of the Singapore River waterfront, this paper analyses three forms of urban reclamation. They include reclaiming functionality, aimed at infusing the waterfront with new land uses; reclaiming access, as a way of opening up the landscape to more people; and reclaiming the local, as a way to commemorate local cultures and histories. While government planners and private enterprise are intent on developing a world-class environment, Singaporeans and visitors respond to this urban vision in different ways with some praising the dynamism of worldly transformations and others criticising them as a prelude to a soulless city. While some degree of worldliness is essential in any redevelopment, a fine balance has to be sought between the excesses of global urbanism and the parochialism of vernacular concerns. \u00a9 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Chang T.C., Huang S.","DOI":"10.1177\/0042098010382677","x":2.3800001144,"y":8.3000001907},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":32,"Cited by":46.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Natural disaster and nuclear crisis in Japan: Response and recovery after Japan\u2019s 3\/11","Abstract":"The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan plunged the country into a state of crisis.

This paper presents the case of the Singapore River development zone as a \"hyper-symbol\" of Singapore's global urbanism. By creating a world-class riverfront not unlike the acclaimed waterfronts of London, Sydney, or San Francisco, Singapore's urban planners hope to project the city as a venue worthy of world-class tourism and leisure activities, an important node in international circuits of capital, and a vibrant city for both foreign visitors and local residents. Our paper, however, also argues that local forces and influences play a significant role in the waterfront's development. The Singapore River landscape is the negotiated outcome of both globalism and localism\u2014a dialectical landscape formed by dominant global influences on the one hand, and emerging local processes on the other. Fieldwork comprising a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews, and on-site observations provide evidence of such global-local interactions.

This economic, social and political transformation has led to the emergence of a new Chinese middle class, and understanding the development and the role of this new social group is crucial to understanding contemporary Chinese society. Investigating the new politics of the middle class in China, this book addresses three major questions. First, how does the Chinese state deal with problems of national sovereignty and political representation to create the middle class both as a legitimate category of the people and as an ideal norm of citizenship? Second, how does the recognition of the middle class norm take place in the practice of everyday life? Finally, what kind of risks does the politics of the middle class generate not only for middle class subjects but also for the disenfranchised? In answering these questions, this book examines a set of practices, bodies of knowledge, measures, and institutions that aim to manage, govern, control, and orient the behaviours, gestures, and thoughts of Chinese citizens. This investigation contributes not only to the understanding of the Chinese middle class society but also to the scholarly debate over the relationship between governmental apparatuses, subjectification, and life-building. Drawing on ethnographic information, historical archives, and the media, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars working in the fields of Chinese studies, Chinese politics, ethnic studies and urban studies, as well as those interested in culture, society, class and welfare. \u00a9 2013 Hai Ren.

In analyzing Dutton's career, I use a Gramscian conception of the role of intellectuals in creating colonial hegemony, against the backdrop of recent research on the relationship of geography to colonial discourse. Dutton worked and corresponded with key players in Britain's African empire. He was a major force behind early urban-planning programs in East and Central Africa and author of four geographical books. Permanently disabled by war wounds, he was also permanently infatuated with the moral rightness of British imperial culture. A concern for geography's professional relationship with, and the geographical legacy of, colonialism has emerged in recent scholarship on Africa, largely through studies of travel writing, fiction, and nineteenth- or early twentieth-century exploration geography. Later scholar-officials like Dutton sought to apply their knowledge to the shaping of spaces to serve the Empire's direct and immediate needs in Africa, even while trying to win the hearts and minds of its subject peoples. Around Timothy Mitchell's (1988) concept of \"enframing,\" I build an analysis of the spatial projects with which Dutton is most associated and show how Lusaka and Zanzibar were enframed by his plans. Through his publications and correspondences, as well as his seemingly omnipresent service, Dutton has an important legacy that has neither been articulated nor analyzed, one which points to the importance of contextualized biography for analyses of colonial discourse. I argue here for seeing Dutton as an intellectual in the service of colonial hegemony and its enframing spatial discourse, although the character of his agency exemplifies why that attempted hegemony failed.","Author Keywords":"Africa; Colonialism; Cultural hegemony","Authors":"Myers G.A.","DOI":"10.1111\/1467-8306.00082","x":4.2199997902,"y":6.5199999809},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":51,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Wildfire risk, biodiversity and peri-urban planning in the Mt Lofty Ranges, South Australia","Abstract":"Major fires on the periphery of Australian cities are reframing perceptions of what constitutes effective landscape planning and vegetation management. The emerging governance challenge to simultaneously mitigate wildfire risk and support improved conservation practices is reviewed in the context of pre-colonial and modern cultures within the peri-urban Mediterranean climatic region of South Australia's Mt Lofty Ranges. The analysis suggests that anthropogenic burning of landscape has been a vital historical component of risk management. During the early modern era however, improved capacities to manage wildfire risk led to complacency in light of the hazard, which in turn has led to urbanization that has not sufficiently accounted for the levels of risk. A planning conflict is emerging within the wooded uplands as there is renewed interest in wildfire risk, which is reflected in new state policies providing greater allowances for land owners to clear vegetation around dwellings. Although attempts have been made to constrain urban growth around the city of Adelaide, recent workshops with key environmental management stakeholders suggest that urbanization continues within the Mt Lofty Ranges in areas that are both highly vulnerable to fire and of great importance for biodiversity conservation, such that planning is not reflecting the cultures of risk or biodiversity value. For such risks and values to be taken into account within reflexive systems of governance, the narratives on opportunities for adaptation generated by the people who facilitate vegetation management must be accommodated into deliberations on policy. The identification and planning of particularly vulnerable and valuable spaces within the broader landscape and cultural contexts of risk and value would enable complex, targeted responses to environmental hazards, conservation and development needs in the peri-urban uplands. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Biodiversity conservation; Peri-urban; Planning; Reflexivity; Risk; South Australia; Urban development; Wildfire","Authors":"Bardsley D.K., Weber D., Robinson G.M., Moskwa E., Bardsley A.M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apgeog.2015.06.012","x":2.1099998951,"y":4.7800002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":52,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Imagining Portland's urban growth boundary: Planning regulation as cultural icon","Abstract":"Problem: In the 30 years since its creation, has Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation?

It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media.Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives. Takeaway for practice: In the world of 21st-century planning theory there is a strong assumption that many voices engaged in overlapping conversations can help shape more equitable and sustainable cities. Creative depictions of Portland's UGB show the role of cultural actors in shaping and enriching such conversations.","Author Keywords":"Culture and regulation; Oregon; Urban growth boundary (UGB); Portland","Authors":"Abbott C., Margheim J.","DOI":"10.1080\/01944360801944997","x":3.2599999905,"y":5.6700000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":60,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Uncovering inconspicuous places using social media check-ins and street view images","Abstract":"There is a Chinese proverb, \u201cif your wine tastes really good, you do not need to worry about the location of your bar (\u9152\u9999\u4e0d\u6015\u5df7\u5b50\u6df1)\u201d, which implies that the popular places for local residents are sometimes hidden behind an unassuming door or on unexpected streets. Discovering these unassuming places (e.g. restaurants) of a city will benefit the understanding of local culture and help to build livable neighborhoods. Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing. These places are potential recreational areas for all groups of people and could be improved regarding urban design and planning to make these public infrastructures more attractive. This work demonstrates how multi-source big geo-data can be combined to build comprehensive place-based representations for different groups of people. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Place semantics; Residents and visitors; Social media check-ins; Social sensing; Street view images","Authors":"Zhang F., Zu J., Hu M., Zhu D., Kang Y., Gao S., Zhang Y., Huang Z.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101478","x":2.6099998951,"y":6.9099998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":62,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Property rights and landscape planning in the intermountain west: The Teton Valley case","Abstract":"Non-participation in landscape planning presents a formidable challenge to sustainable development. We hypothesize that even when people hold negative attitudes toward unplanned development, natural property rights values (favorable evaluations of property as an inviolable and pre-political right) prevent them from acting on their concerns. We chose an intermountain west community as a case study to evaluate our hypothesis regarding natural property rights values. All groups were equally and strongly opposed to continuation of rapid unplanned growth, but those with natural property rights values were also adamantly opposed to land use planning. We used a multiple logistic regression model to evaluate the relationship between support for landscape planning and a natural property rights values. An overall significance test of the regression equation indicated the independent variables were significantly predictive of the dependent variable (\u03c72 128, 8 d.f., p &lt; 0.001) and had high (88.7%) predictive capacity. Natural property rights value was the most important predictor variable, but income was also significant. Sustainable landscape planning requires uncoupling property rights from inviolable and pre-political natural rights. Our results suggest a conversation focused on themes associated with loss of local culture, hypocrisy of building practices, and market control over development could facilitate the aforementioned uncoupling and development planning that promotes both security for land owners and public welfare. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Russian Empire 1450-1801 surveys how Russia\u2019s many subject areas were conquered and how the empire was governed. It considers the Russian empire a \u201cEurasian empire,\u201d characterized by a \u201cpolitics of difference\u201d: the rulers and their elites at the center defined the state\u2019s needs minimally (control over defense, taxation and mobilization of resources, criminal law) and otherwise tolerated local religions, languages, cultures, elites, and institutions. The center related to communities and religions vertically, according each a modicum of rights and autonomies but not allowing \u201chorizontal\u201d connections across social, ethnic, confessional, or other groups potentially with common interest. This book gives detailed attention to the major ethnic and religious groups as it surveys strategies of governance-centralized bureaucracy, military reform, judicial system, tolerance of difference. It pays particular attention to the dissemination of a supranational ideology of political legitimacy in a variety of media, particularly symbolic, such as public ritual, painting, architecture, and urban planning. Beginning with foundational features, such as geography, climate, demography, and geopolitical situation, the book explores the empire\u2019s primarily agrarian economy, serfdom, towns and trade, religions, nobility, and high culture. It tracks the emergence of an \u201cImperial nobility\u201d and a national self-consciousness that was, by the end of the eighteenth century, distinctly imperial, embracing the diversity of the empire\u2019s many peoples and cultures. \u00a9 Nancy Shields Kollmann 2017.","Author Keywords":"Architecture; Belarus; Crimea; Dynasty; Empire; Ethnic groups; Eurasia; Politics of difference; Siberia; Ukraine","Authors":"Kollmann N.S.","DOI":"10.1093\/acprof:oso\/9780199280513.001.0001","x":1.7899999619,"y":6.3200001717},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":72,"Cited by":19.0,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Blue urbanism: Exploring connections between cities and oceans","Abstract":"What would it mean to live in cities designed to foster feelings of connectedness to the ocean? As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like \"community supported fisheries\" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more \"green.\" Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of \"ocean literacy\" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals. \u00a9 2014 Timothy Beatley.

A concentration of people in the same geographic area who are of similar ethnic background, culture and language can be an important source of financial and personal support, information and guidance, and social mores. Evidence is found that, after controlling for a range of other observable and unobservable factors important to the location decision, the concentration of people of a particular ethnic group in a particular area has a significant effect on the chance that new immigrants of the same ethnic group will choose to live there. The size of the effect, however, depends on the personal characteristics of immigrants. The attraction of ethnic concentrations of immigrants is significantly smaller for new immigrants with a university degree and for those who normally speak English at home.

Chandigarh emerged as part of the post-Partition need for a new capital for the Punjab, and involved the efforts of several people and levels of government. The context of newly achieved nationhood became important in the way it shaped the ideals of both national and local political leaders, who wanted architects to transfer these into built form. How successful the architects were in this enterprise was shaped by their professional ideologies and understanding (or lack of it) of the local. Much scholarship exists on issues such as early decisions about Chandigarh's establishment, the Mayer and Le Corbusier plans for the city, and the buildings comprising the Capitol complex that were designed by Le Corbusier. Much less attention has been given to the residential areas of Chandigarh and all that lay beyond the Capitol complex and constitutes the actual town.

Despite lip-service to \"triple bottom line\" assessments of policies and developments, Australia's policymakers have advanced no further than a \"double bottom line\" based on economic and environmental values, the latter preferably expressed in dollar terms. The economic (or market relation) also substitutes for the social dimension in a continued policy emphasis on customers rather than citizens or community members. An overemphasis on behavioural economics, a lack of social, political and cultural theory, and neglect of people's actual practices means that much policy and research around water fails to grapple with such basic social elements as gender, different roles and access to resources within households, cultural diversity, or ethical orientations. A major challenge is to mobilise rather than ignore the altruistic and socially-oriented human capacities for adapting to change beyond the customer relation or the confines of technical and economic rationality; including by collective innovations in values and practices of caring for water. \u00a9 Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Author Keywords":"Cultural innovation; Customer behaviour; Gender and water; Household water; Socially sustainable urban water; Sustainability models","Authors":"Sofoulis Z.","DOI":"10.7158\/W13-018.2013.17.2","x":1.6299999952,"y":5.0500001907},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":126,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Sustainable Cultural Spaces in the Global City: Cultural Clusters in Heritage Sites, Hong Kong and Singapore","Abstract":"[No abstract available]","Author Keywords":"Cattle Depot Artist Village, Hong Kong - a cattle slaughterhouse, in former British colony; Challenges, confronting sustainability of Cattle Depot Artist Village - lack of clarity of official responsibility, and broken chains of governance; Chinatown, Singapore's inscription of \"Chineseness\" - roots in colonial urban planning; Cultural clusters in heritage sites, Hong Kong and Singapore - sustainable cultural spaces in global cities; Cultural investment in urban and economic growth - space for cultural use; Cultural space, in global cities in Asia, Hong Kong and Singapore - local places, turned to cultural use; Culture-led urban regeneration and cultural\/creative economy - cultural investment, valued because of urban and economic regeneration; Global cities, and cultural spaces - vibrancy and viability of spaces, vitality of global cities; Global cities, networked nodes - multiple and intensive global flows of people, goods, services, ideas and images; Urban spaces, economic and cultural flows - characterizing global city","Authors":"Kong L.","DOI":"10.1002\/9781444395105.ch40","x":2.5699999332,"y":7.9800000191},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":128,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Beside downtown: Global Chinatowns","Abstract":"For much of the nineteenth and twentieth century, in Barcelona's barrio chino\/barrixino, decaying tenements and crowded streets housed thousands of immigrant workers slaving in aging factories or seeking day- to- day opportunities at the nearby port. Only the broad, tree- lined Rambles, a promenade beloved of fl\u00e2neurs, separated the middling classes and elites of the historic city center from this \"Chinatown\" (this boulevard, in fact, had replaced an earlier urban wall). After dark, however, exotic nocturnal amusements including prostitution, drugs, and gambling lured adventurous bourgeois men, bohemian artists, journalists, and even transnational revolutionaries into the barrio chino. In the twenty- first century, nonetheless, as Barcelona's post- Olympic urban revitalization has spread from the port and historical core outward, this \"Chinatown,\" rechristened as the historic Raval, has been demolished in favor of neoliberal development of sanitized public spaces, new hotel and tourist ser vices, gentrified residences, and cultural facilities including museums, foundations, and the Universitat de Barcelona. The Raval has displaced the chino, its older inhabitants, its bars, social centers and memories (McDonogh 1987, 2002; McNeill 1999; Magriny\u00e0 and Maza, this volume). While this may seem to be a stereo typical Chinatown in location, function, and imagery, it differs from others where we have worked in a fundamental demographic element- the absence of Chinese. Barcelona had few Chinese until the 1990s. Instead, many inhabitants of this dense central zone had arrived from poorer Spanish regions of Andalusia and Aragon. Journalist Paco Madrid borrowed the sobriquet \"Chinatown\" in 1927 from his reading of San Francisco, using barrio chino as an urban metaphor to evoke an ambience of cosmopolitan mystery and Barcelona's status as a world city (McDonogh 1987). When the first waves of Chinese arrived in Spain in the late 1990s, in fact, they settled elsewhere, including an important cluster next to the downtown area of a suburban Barcelona satellite city, Santa Coloma. Nonetheless, Barcelonans' metaphorization of the early twentieth- century location and imagery of Chinatowns, like the demands and pressures of center city development that continue to change the area, are familiar and even suggestive phenomena for global downtowns. For more than a decade we have lived, worked, and studied in Chinatowns worldwide, including Chinese enclaves in and around Chicago, New York, Sydney, Lima, Los Angeles, Bangkok, Havana, Paris, San Jos\u00e9, Panama City, and S\u00e3o Paulo, in addition to our anchorage in Wong's native Hong Kong and our home in Greater Philadelphia. These Chinatowns sometimes have been backgrounds for other projects in urban studies, mass media, architecture, and visual culture (for example, Wong 1991, 1999); they also have become interwoven with lives of our family and friends. Our experiences and investigations underpin the complexities of multisite downtown ethnography through which we have examined shared characteristics of place, function, ideology, and evolution (McDonogh and Wong 2005). These social, special, and cultural features embody both Chinese agency and evolving Chinese globalization, although we do not develop such a phenomenological exploration here. Instead, we argue that Chinatowns are deeply enmeshed with the structure and nature of central districts that such Chinatowns often border, a relationship mapped decades ago by Burgess and the Chicago School (Burgess 1925: 56). Chinatowns provide a multivalent vantage from which to illuminate critical features of global downtowns, including the evolution of central spaces and functions, the competitive markets for people and capital they embody, and the play of locality, region, nation- state, and transnational articulation shaping downtowns as well as Chinatowns. To analyze the dialectic of Chinatowns and global downtowns, we consider five specific themes: (1) the emergence and movement of Chinatowns in relation to urban cores; (2) the imagery of Chinatowns as cultural spaces that illuminates race, immigration, gender, and morality in downtowns; (3) competing contemporary demands for land, development, and movement, both Chinese and non- Chinese; (4) the meaning of Chinatowns in relation to suburban and global networks; and (5) new Chinatowns as a counterpoint to future downtowns. Together, these themes underscore the fact that Chinatowns are not exotic alternative spaces but offer fundamental insights on downtowns as urban\/regional places of political economic power, social structure, and cultural meaning constituted by multilayered and contested global flows of goods, people, knowledge, and imagery.

In underdeveloped countries this fact is expressed in a chaotic manner, generating social and structural problems. The city of Rio de Janeiro is a megalopolis known worldwide for its natural beauties, including beaches and forests and because of favelas (subnormal clusters of houses of economically poor people).The favelas are composed of a mosaic of cultures which reflects even in urban afforestation. In this work we characterize the afforestation structure of a favela to understand its ecological and social functionalities. The survey was conducted in the favela Morro da Formiga, with an area of approximately 30 ha. It was conducted through a census and using the list of species, a classification based on 11 parameters was carried out. 1,042 individuals were found, belonging to 110 genera, 148 species and 42 families. The most abundant species shows that the planters intend is, leastwise partially, generating an extra-support for community in terms of feeding fruits (62% of the subjects had this purpose). In relation to the nature thereof, the natives species represents 54% of the total, while the exotic species 39%. About 50% of the trees are in the backyards of houses and a few in squares and streets. It was found that 70% of individuals were planted by residents. Studies are needed to identify which native species can replace community demands currently supplied by exotic species that have been used for decades. The \u201cforestation\u201d in favelas is quite distinct from that implemented by the city hall in more urbanized areas. In favelas, the species reflect more about the knowledge of the local population, their backgrounds and needs. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Author Keywords":"Rio de Janeiro; Slums; Urban ecology; Urban forestry","Authors":"Sartori R.A., Martins G.A.C., Za\u00fa A.S., Brasil L.S.C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ufug.2018.10.004","x":2.7300000191,"y":6.2100000381},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":134,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Bridges in Urban Planning and Architectural Culture","Abstract":"Bridges obviously serve multiple functions but the primary purpose is to traverse a terrain obstacle to get goods and\/or people across to the other side.

Specifically, the article explores the relationship between the spatial dynamics of the conflicts-in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity-and the following four dimensions of urban space: social composition; built environment; propensity to associate and to voice; and accessibility to various urban resources. The results of statistical analyses by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Mann-Whitney test show, regardless of the dimension considered, to what extent certain areas are characterized by frequency, duration, or intensity of the conflict activity. Specifically, the results suggest that the degree of involvement of local people in a conflict varies very much depending on the nature of the social composition. Other findings show a relationship between areas with a high propensity to associate and to voice and a conflict activity that is more intense, more frequent, but not necessarily longer. These forms of social practices are thus testimony to the existence of know-how, i.e., a culture of conflict activity oriented towards efficiency. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Author Keywords":"Spatial analysis; Statistical analysis; Territorial decision-making processes; Urban conflicts; Urban environments","Authors":"Pelletier M., Joerin F., Kestens Y., Villeneuve P.Y.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12061-010-9050-8","x":2.7200000286,"y":5.4099998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":140,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"La Belle Mort en Milieu rural: A report of an ethnographic study of the good death for Quebec rural francophones","Abstract":"An ethnographic study was undertaken in two rural areas of Quebec to conceptualize the good death. The findings reveal that a good quality of life for the dying person and his or her family and friends is essential for a good death. The resulting conceptual model emphasized four dimensions: physical, spiritual, social, and emotional\/psychological. These dimensions were determined to be similar to those discovered through a previous urban study, indicating that there may be considerable overlap between good deaths in rural and urban areas. Some findings of this Quebec French-language rural study were similar to those of an Alberta English-language rural study, indicating that rural people may have some common needs and interests with regard to the good death. As such, there could be some common elements of the good death that transcend culture or ethnicity. Chief among these is the desire of rural people to die at home or in their home communities.","Author Keywords":"Culture; End-of-life care; Ethnography; Good death; Palliative care; Quality of life; Research; Rural","Authors":"Veillette A.-M., Fillion L., Wilson D.M., Thomas R., Dumont S.","DOI":"10.1177\/082585971002600304","x":2.2400000095,"y":5.3899998665},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":148,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Small businesses and the vitality of main street","Abstract":"People use the neighborhood Main Street for shopping but also for other leisurely activities, active and passive engagement, social affiliation and interaction, sensory stimulation, and relaxation. Traditionally, small businesses have made up a fair share of businesses on Main Street. Small businesses have been an integral part of the American culture of entrepreneurship, individualism, and self-reliance and have played an important role in American economic development. Community development programs recommend supporting small businesses for their social and economic benefits. This paper examines the role of small businesses in supporting public life on the neighborhood Main Street. The study urn conducted in two cities and one town in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. Extensive behavior mapping and interviews were conducted to determine the relationship between social interaction and small businesses. The findings expand our understanding of the social value of small businesses and suggest a strong relationship between small businesses and the vitality of Main Street as a result offour qualities of small businesses: uniqueness, engagement, friendliness, and responsiveness. These findings have implications for urban design, community planning, and economic development policies because they suggest that small businesses influence their immediate public space by paying more attention to it than large businesses. Small businesses provide qualities that help make Main Street a good place for people to interact. \u00a9 2011, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Mehta V.","DOI":null,"x":2.5599999428,"y":6.9899997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":150,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Julius Caesar in Western Culture","Abstract":"This book explores the significance of Julius Caesar to different periods, societies and people from the 50s BC through to the twenty-first century. \u2022 This interdisciplinary volume explores the significance of Julius Caesar to different periods, societies and people. \u2022 Ranges over the fields of religious, military, and political history, archaeology, architecture and urban planning, the visual arts, and literary, film, theatre and cultural studies. \u2022 Examines representations of Caesar in Italy, France, Germany, Britain, and the United States in particular. \u2022 Objects of analysis range from Caesar's own commentaries on the Gallic wars, through Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and images of Caesar in Italian fascist popular culture, to contemporary cinema and current debates about American empire. \u2022 Edited by a leading expert on the reception of ancient Rome. \u2022 Includes original contributions by international experts on Caesar and his reception. \u00a9 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Wyke M.","DOI":"10.1002\/9780470775042","x":4.6399998665,"y":6.2399997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":154,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"On the trail of comparative urbanism: Square dance and public space in China","Abstract":"Civic cultures in public space occupy a central place in the theorisations of social relations and social interactions in the modern city. But theoretical perspectives formulated in Western urban contexts tend to assume clear-cut distinction between Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft, and between the public and private realms, and assume that encounter automatically steers people towards the ethics and politics of difference. These optics represent epistemologies which for the most part address the socio-spatial nexus in Euro-American urban modernity, and are ill equipped for elucidating the contingent, improvised relationships between public space and multiple urban modernities beyond the West. This paper works on the trail of the comparative urbanism and delves into configurations of publicness in \u201csquare dance\u201d in reform-era urban China. Starting from historical conceptions of publicness in China but being mindful of how they are reconfigured and renegotiated amid a rapid transition towards urban modernity, this paper argues that publicness in reform-era China is of a largely experimental, negotiated nature. On the one hand, square dance exceeds sociological accounts and categories which produce epistemological opposition between stranger and community, between public self and intimate affiliations. It incubates sentiments of collectivism that overcome anonymity and strangeness but do not contradict the ethos of individualism in the modern city. On the other hand, square dance can be conceptualised as an active process of urban learning, in which people are motivated to reflect over what codes, rules, and ethics are needed for governing urban publics. In all, this paper aims to broaden the conceptual spectrum of the ideas of public space and urban civic cultures through comparative analysis and theorisation.

In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement. In order to allow for a more effective participation of humans in the simulation, our approach does not use central coordinators or coordination protocol, but rather each agent takes its own decision so to make more realistic interactions. A software architecture and initial experimental results are presented and discussed. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Robol M., Giorgini P., Busetta P.","DOI":"10.1109\/ISC2.2016.7580808","x":4.2699999809,"y":3.9100000858},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":163,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"The Gateway Arch: A biography","Abstract":"Rising to a triumphant height of 630 feet, the Gateway Arch in St. Louis is a revered monument to America's western expansion. Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid-1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world's most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition, greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay. Campbell dispels long-held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize-winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision. As a national symbol, the Gateway Arch has a singular place in American culture, Campbell concludes, yet it also stands as an instructive example of failed urban planning. \u00a9 2013 by Tracy Campbell.

Developing Guidelines for Human-centered Outdoor Spaces in China that Citizens Can be Proud of","Abstract":"Creating livable cities through cultural development is important not only because of the inherent value of culture itself, but also because of the social, economic, and environmental benefits afforded by communities with increased pride and attachment to places and people they share the city with. This is increasingly more critical for children and young people, as educating them to become better citizens, it also do strongly relate with development habits and their awareness of interacting with outdoor environments surrounding them. For inhabitants of cities to live an enriched life in every means, they require more than just the infrastructure and the trappings of material wealth: They require an attachment to a place, a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose, of which, a sound cultural development can help generate. Given the central government's recent emphasis in the 13th 5-year plan on encouraging creative and innovative industries, it is relevant to generate programs on cultural development focusing on younger generations. Through this, municipal governments can improve the quality of life and empower the young generation to shape the long-term prosperity of their cities. What are various ways to develop solutions based on strengthening community relations? What are the dynamics of relationship of people with each other from different social milieu?

In addition to situating cities within a regional context and advancing a socioecological understanding of urbanization, he viewed cities as the principal artifact of, and theater wherein, human culture evolves. This expansive view of cities may be one of the more challenging aspects of Geddes\u2019 legacy to assimilate. Working during a late 19th and early 20th century period when the limitations of modernity were becoming increasingly apparent, much of Geddes\u2019 aspirational thinking can be seen as an effort to create what he described as a \u201clarger modernism.\u201d In this regard, Geddes can be counted amongst those whom we portray as integrative holistic thinkers, people whose worldview draws them toward meaning-making narratives and frameworks that include the many dimensions of the human condition. Today, a new generation of holistic approaches called \u201cmetatheories\u201d \u2013 and \u201cintegral theory\u201d in particular \u2013 provides an orienting lens through which to review, assess, and potentially extend the work of Geddes in the 21st century.

We then assess correspondence between the two, focusing on Interdisciplinary Holism; Evolution, Development and Complex Systems; Human Agency and Ethics; and Spirituality. A closing discussion addresses prospects for future research, and suggests that the holistic, evolutionary, and generative orientation of our principal subjects may have particular relevance in an anthropogenic biosphere characterized, in part, by significant environmental challenges and the concentration of humans in cities. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Anthropocene; Anthropogenic biosphere; Cities; Integral theory; Landscape and urban planning; Metatheories; Patrick Geddes; Sociocultural evolution; Socioecological planning; Urbanization","Authors":"Eisenman T.S., Murray T.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2017.05.011","x":3.5599999428,"y":5.9000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":187,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"From the First Five-Year Plan to the Cultural Revolution: the pre-reform urban transformation of Hangzhou, China","Abstract":"Pre-reform Chinese cities base their uniqueness in urban transformation on Mao's duality of utopian and revolutionary ideals and pragmatic and economized approaches in practice.

By the case study of Hangzhou, this research reveals that urban development was driven by a diverse set of forces devised by the communist state to configure the urban conditions and control people's daily lives in pursuit of radical socialist goals. The controls from the state and other pertinent forces led to the actual outcomes of political-economic ambitions and spatial policy rhetoric. It was an inherent feature of the society and economy to go outside of the state's controls, and the unintended consequences were unavoidable. The state had to revise their strategies, the outcomes of which were again to be tested by time.

This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Ecosystem management; Municipal government; Nature-based solutions; Q-method; Urban forest governance; Urban planning","Authors":"Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez C., Kendal D., Threlfall C.G., Hochuli D.F., Davern M., Fuller R.A., van der Ree R., Livesley S.J.","DOI":"10.3390\/f11090963","x":2.1900000572,"y":4.8699998856},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":204,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"The role of smart city applications in the development of IDP areas in war countries","Abstract":"The aim of this paper is the role that smart city applications can play in the development and sustainability processes in countries that have been hit by crises such as the Syrian Arab Republic, particularly Lattakia, which has been hit by a big displacement crisis.

Therefore, many challenges have appeared in cities all over the world related to growth, over- population, urban planning, quality of services, competitiveness, environmental factors and citizenship values, which have become main priorities of the managers and mayors of these cities. The Smart City concept emerges as a paradigm that aims to solve these problems and challenges, by developing policies, infrastructure, ser- vices and public awareness programs that will transform today cities, for example a future self-sustaining innovation, growth, technological development, civic and ethical citizenship and social progress.

It is usually evaluated based on how loud the urban environment is. However, this approach does not consider people's perception of the urban acoustic environment. Therefore, a different method has been developed based on the perception of the acoustic environment using the concept of soundscape. Soundscape is defined as the acoustic environment perceived by people who are part of the environment. This approach considers the relationship between the sound source, the environment, and the people. The analysis of soundscape considers many aspects such as cultural aspects, people's expectations, people's experience of space, and social aspects. Soundscape affects many aspects of human life such as culture, health, and the quality of life. Urban soundscape management and planning must be integrated with the other aspect of urban design, both in the design and the improvement stages. The soundscape concept seeks to make the acoustic environment as pleasant as possible in a space with or without uncomfortable sound sources. Soundscape planning includes the design of physical features to achieve a positive perceptual outcome. It is vital to gather data regarding the relationship between humans and the components of a soundscape, e.g., sound sources, features of the physical environment, the functions of a space, and the expectation of the sound source. The data can be measured and gathered using several soundscape evaluation methods. Soundscape evaluation is usually conducted using in-situ surveys and laboratory experiments using a multi-speaker system. Although these methods have been validated and are widely used in soundscape analysis, there are some limitations in the application. The in-situ survey needs to be done at one time with many people at the same time because it is hard to replicate the acoustic environment. Conversely, the laboratory experiment does not have a problem with the repetition of the experiment. This method requires a room with a multi-speaker reproduction system. This project used a different method to analyse soundscape developed using headphones via the internet. The internet system for data gathering has been established; a website has enabled to reproduce high-quality audio and it has a system to design online questionnaires. Furthermore, the development of a virtual reality system allows the reproduction of virtual audio-visual stimulus on a website. Although the website has an established system to gather the required data, the problem is the validation of the reproduction system for soundscape analysis, which needs to be done with consideration of several factors: the suitable recording system, the effect of headphone variation, the calibration of the system, and the perception result from internet-based acoustic environment reproduction. This study aims to develop and validate a web-based urban soundscape evaluation method. By using this method, the experiment can be repeated easily and data can be gathered from many respondents. Furthermore, the simplicity of the system allows for the application by the stakeholders in urban design. The data gathered from this system is important for the design of an urban area with consideration of the acoustic aspects. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sudarsono A.S., Sarwono J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1755-1315\/158\/1\/012052","x":4.9200000763,"y":7.5500001907},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":209,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"'Auraldiversity': Defining a hearing- centred perspective to socially equitable design of the built environment","Abstract":"Historically, sound, soundscape and human hearing have collectively received litt le att ention in the design of urban spaces and places, particularly with regards to the psychological and sociological impact of hearing on the experience of individuals in the built environment. It is proposed that the sonic considerations which have been made in urban design are commonly developed within an assumption of otologically normal hearing, and, more broadly, without the acknowledgement of the actual diversity in people's auditory and sensory abilities. Existing considerations of sound and hearing within inclusive design research, particularly in the built environment, are grounded in an 'auraltypical' perspective where the primary focus is hearing individuals or those with hearing loss. This position supposes to some degree that an idealized otological profi le and consistent model of hearing profi ciency is shared amongst all citizens and engenders a culture of urban design driven by 'good\/bad' ears and homogenized sonic interaction. This paper introduces the theoretical paradigm of 'auraldiversity' - an emerging agenda that acknowledges the diversity of human hearing and the multitude of elements that place the hearing modality within a state of constant fl ux. The paper situates this theoretical perspective within the context of the built environment through the mapping of three 'auraldivergent' hearing profi les. Each profi le charts the lived sonic experiences of a d\/Deaf or disabled individual in the built environment. The paper concludes by positioning the auraldiversity paradigm as a catalyst in the development of a hearing-centred approach to inclusive design research, a new agenda where the opportunity for more socially and sonically equitable design of the built environment is established. \u00a9 2018 Ingenta.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Renel W.","DOI":"10.2148\/benv.44.1.36","x":4.6900000572,"y":7.4499998093},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":212,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Lewis Mumford's Urbanism and the Problem of Environmental Modernity","Abstract":"This essay reconsiders the early career of Lewis Mumford and the assumption that modernity has been disastrous environmentally.

Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic \"renewal\" but also as a landscape full of what he called \"remnants\" and \"persistents\"; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. \u00a9 2016 The Author.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sachs A.","DOI":"10.1093\/envhis\/emw034","x":3.4300000668,"y":5.9200000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":216,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Swettenham pier waterfront redevelopment, Penang","Abstract":"A waterfront is a place where life of a city bloomed.

Having to attend to this said aim, the redevelopment of Swettenham Pier waterfront is to give a chance to the people to claim a part of this waterfront, for living, for leisure or for any unplanned activities, as to establish its aim to contribute back to the local people, local culture and local living. This call for a strategy to design a waterfront to revive the history, while injecting new life to the place for people and activities to be carry on care freely. The design potential of this project is to look through the entire master plan of the waterfront and then move into the micro elements that support the entire scheme. The master plan plays a crucial role in supporting the waterfront with various types of activities that serve various demographics of users. The redevelopment of the new cruise terminal would also be explored thoroughly in conjunction with Penang Structure Plan in order to come out with the design that could cope with future development. One of the key outcomes of this research is that community magnet or a civic component inserted in the scheme will contribute back to the local people and culture. \u00a9 2015 AENSI Publisher All rights reserved.","Author Keywords":"Public spaces\/function plaza; Redevelopment; Revitalize; Socio-cultural; Tourist destination area; Urban design characteristics; Waterfront; Waterfront development","Authors":"Teoh Tong M., Ismail S., Yusoff S.Y., Utaberta N., Yunos M.Y.M., Ismail N.A.","DOI":null,"x":2.7300000191,"y":8.4200000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":220,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Living near the \"town that lost its water\": Explaining residents' environmental concerns in a rural-small urban township in Ontario","Abstract":"This study is concerned with developing culturally sensitive risk management strategies among Old Order Mennonite (OOM) and other communities, living in the Township of Woolwich and farming along a tributary of the Grand River.

The local neighbourhood is very important to understand how people conceive the city in their minds. The representative memory captures the elements related to spatial identity of a place, but more often than not, these representations are pictorial images superimposed upon the fabric resulted from the standardized tools used for analysing the spatial qualities and its attributes. The recognition of the finding to capture elements related to experiences of spatial identity problematizes from well-established urban design spatial theories. On the other hand, Indian city is a collective of people, place and events. These neighbourhoods may not be central to social or business relationships nor centre for historic monuments, but the activities, users, events, location and spatial conditions that support them are very different\u2014together key to the legibility of the city. More often than not, the impacts due to the city\u2019s regeneration process sustain the test of time and manifest into a deeper system for building an image of the place. Hence, embedded meaning and meaningful association over time become crucial for the built morphology. One such neighbourhood is Pettah1\u2014the old core of city of Bangalore. Bengaluru was one of the key trading centres of the south during the pre-colonial era. The idea of a town structured around Pettah (market), Kote2 (fort), Kere3 (lakes and tanks) and Totha4 (gardens and parks) was an unquestionable matrix of natural occurrences and cultural practices. Decades to follow many influences on to the town added a layer of new structure, and every stage of progress enunciated the past with a new skin of elements. It is this value of city\u2019s memory that lie buried within us carrying forward our past into its present fabric. Hence, the study reveals the need to radically departure from the routines of recording legibility and imageability through mental, sensory and visual mapping and to record in terms of space, events, time, activities as well as sense of public-ness. Ultimately, the findings also brings optimism into urban design practice, offering new insight into how to record mosaic of an area in an Indian city that will capture the strong perceived and conceived imagery of a place and hence sensitive responsive proposals that will aid to carefully conceive a system for the future. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Author Keywords":"Character; Culture; Elusive; Morphology; Neighbourhood","Authors":"Bydar Shubhashchandra S., Subramanian R.R.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-51961-2_18","x":3.7899999619,"y":7.3499999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":232,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Resonating the \u2018culture\u2019 debate in urban planning","Abstract":"In this era of rapid urbanisation, an understanding of the role of culture in advancing urban planning and development is important for effective urban management, especially in Africa where the culture of informality is dominant.

Interaction between Russian and Chinese universities in the scientific and educational sphere has specific features and reflects the general mechanisms of functioning in social and cultural environment. The socio-cultural context of such interaction is the life activity of megalopolis, regional features and it is related to the socio-cultural traditions of people relationship. The general purpose of the study was to identify changes in interaction between Russian and Chinese students studying in a Russian University. The study conducted in Russian and Chinese Universities. The research methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The primary data was collected using questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Three hundred and ninety respondents - Russian students and five hundred respondents - Chinese students, were questioned on the basis of quota sampling. Depths interviews were conducted with 20 experts. The study has revealed some actual issues and tendencies of social interaction in the educational sphere. It has a temporal character and it is developed in a single educational environment of universities-partners of Russia and China. The study has identified the structure of social interaction, consisting of five levels: 1. At the level of connectivity, social relations between social and ethnic groups (in this case, Russian and Chinese students) are established on the basis of their values. 2. At the level of translation, understanding of the values of another (different) culture through the interpretation of cultural codes (cultural signs) takes place. 3. At the level of transcendence, transition from one's cultural system to another, the development of positive experience and knowledge of another cultural system take place. 4. At the level of adaptation, an interiorization, application in behaviour and activity of values of other cultural system take place. 5. At the level of inter cultural dialogue, an organization of effective and fruitful cooperation between social and ethnic groups and their representatives based on an understanding of the universal values takes place. The five levels of social interaction identified by researches in the joint educational environment of Russian and Chinese universities allow not only to find out the content components of the structure of social and cultural interaction, but also to consider its dynamics and development. Our research has identified a set of factors that affect the functioning of the interaction between Russian and Chinese students structure: geopolitical situation, cost and quality of education, adaptation of training courses for foreigners, comfort of the educational environment of University, the complexity of learning of the host country language, the prestige of education. This model of interaction between social and ethnic groups of Russian and Chinese students being representatives of partner universities is confirmed by the real practice of scientific and educational cooperation between Russian and Chinese universities. Joint forms of University work have been successfully tested and activities that have become events of inter cultural dialogue have been organized. \u00a9 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Contemporary City as Adaptable Hybrid","Abstract":"Global space - both natural and cultural - is the greatest good belonging to the human community. The said community has, therefore, the right and responsibility to protect it, wisely and in solidarity, from wasteful exploitation. The postulate of public utility of this good must also presume such mutual conditioning of the rights and obligations of private owners that would minimise the chance of their infringement of collective interests. The culture of space management became an important measure of cultural level of societies at the turn of the 20th century, perhaps one of those moments which decide upon the future of our civilisation. The conclusion that large agglomerations in particular are \"incorrigible zones of spatial and social pathology, from which we need to escape into pristine areas and there create a more perfect living environment\" is unacceptable, also from the ethical point of view, both as regards the people living in those agglomerations and nature. As far as what has been created by man is concerned, we need to assume that we are able to control and improve this material creation of our civilisation. Such is the fundamental requirement of sustainable development - a difficult, but probably the only way of managing \"the global village\" in the millennium that has just commenced. The spatial structure of the contemporary city as a whole is a broken form: it has formally expressive and perfectly composed elements, it has mutilated compositions, chaotic arrangements and \"lost spaces\", finally, it has spaces that as yet have not been properly used compositionally and are still waiting for their role in the whole. A broken form - in compliance with the principle of irreversibility - may not return to its original composition. Thinking about the future of the city and taking into account the irrefutable fact that a considerable part of the built environment of tomorrow already exists today, we should ask ourselves the question: can it adopt, as a whole, a composition of a different kind? If the urbanised environment, being the basic one, is also to become a full-value environment for human existence, it will require continuous and universal improvement of its quality, as well as new strategies, methods and scenarios for rational organisation of urbanised space that will be able to meet new challenges. It seems that \"dramaturgically consistent logic of composition\" may become an original formula of urban public space. Scenarios built on the basis of the city \"genotype\", in which urban \"layers of memory\" are the basis for adaptive transformations. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Franta A.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/9\/092030","x":3.5399999619,"y":6.1700000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":239,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Overview of relevant regional culture studies (the Krasnoyarsk krai): Challenges and approaches","Abstract":"This article presents the results of the analysis of relevant regional culture studies.

As the proportion of people living in cities in China quintupled from 1950 to 2014, from 11% to 54% according to a 2009 report by McKinsey, while at the same time various challenges have paved the way to limit cultural prosperity and quality of life in cities. Cities currently face number of problems: Vehicle-oriented streets are not friendly to pedestrians; public spaces are designed without users in mind [1]; communities are isolated from one another [2]; and finally creative industries are lagging behind other industries according to a 2014 Forbes report. It seems that China's urban development states a condition of \"survivability\" rather than \"livability\". What is understood from the notion of livability within a city today is to be able to sustain quality of life through holistic planning strategies rather than purely economic ones. Such cities create robust natural environments as well as built environments, social equity as well as social stability. And as a result both a more reliable creative prosperity and economic prosperity have been maintained. This paper will seek to establish a 3-pillar approach to social inclusion and will examine each of these through issues related with migrants in China facing today. It seems that there is a great potential in using mobile and web-based technologies to generate rapid and sustainable solutions for migrants. There is also an enormous potential to develop feedback mechanisms for these solutions that can become part of the 'culture' of living in big cities in China. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"hukou; livability; migrants; mobile technology; social inclusion","Authors":"Gorgul E., Luo L., Rivera C.R., Jesseph B.-A.H., Hamel J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.proeng.2017.07.105","x":2.1900000572,"y":6.7600002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":249,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Colonial architectures, urban planning and the representation of portuguese imperial history","Abstract":"This article proposes a critical analysis of recent interpretations made to the history of architecture and urban planning in the Portuguese colonial context in the twentieth century, particularly in the former African territories.

From its founding, Philadelphia's unfolding futures were consistently dynamic, focusing the energies of colonial expansion, democratic governance, and industrialization in one urban crucible. No other city in America exhibited each trend so dramatically. It was the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876- with the glass and steel dome of its Memorial Hall, its displays of telegraphy and the telephone, its prototype steam automobiles-that first demonstrated to Americans what an industrialized nation might really look like. Ed Bacon was an enthusiast of world's fairs and public exhibitions, writing and speaking of them throughout his career to illustrate and promote trends in urban development, and working in the genre himself to advance a far-reaching planning agenda for Philadelphia in the postwar decades. Philadelphia emerged from World War II burdened by creaking infrastructure and a housing shortage, its Center City business district underperforming against rival cities. Deindustrialization was already noticeable by the mid-1950s, an emerging economic reality that foretold difficulty in achieving the social goals of a new and aggressive generation of reform-minded political leadership.1 Residents were embarking for the suburbs at a steady clip, with the city falling by 1960 from third to fourth in population behind Los Angeles.2 Bacon's 50-year vision projected against this backdrop might have struck the reader as cheerful but unrealistic, even na\u00efve. But what good is a prophecy if it does not reveal a hidden future, a future obstructed? Bacon's future was a city revitalized, beautified, and modernized in time to host the nation's Bicentennial celebration and a simultaneous 1976 Philadelphia World's Fair. Imaginative planning was his method, enabling the political gatekeepers along with the citizens of the city to see with him decades ahead and to grasp the occasion of a fair to accomplish lasting change for the city's built environment and its people. \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009\" builds its case on this one powerful idea: A world's fair could transform it into a model of humane urbanism.3 Considering his vantage point in 1959, it is possible to imagine why Ed Bacon might predict the future of Philadelphia with such mesmerizing flourishes. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC), under his directorship, was in the midst of one of the longest winning streaks any urban planning body had or has ever achieved. With Penn Center, Society Hill, Independence Mall, the neighborhoods of Eastwick and the Far Northeast each underway or finished, Bacon and his team of young planners were totally in their stride in 1959, working to think, dig, and build the city out of its rut. The Market East transportation center, a pedestrian-friendly Chestnut Street, and a tourist-friendly Delaware waterfront were all on Bacon's drawing board, too. These were the varied pieces, described in turn by each of the authors in this volume, of a full urban-renewal portfolio advanced consistently over more than two decades by the PCPC. Postwar federal legislation enabled city officials for the first time to broadly exercise eminent domain powers, moving masses of residents and bulldozing whole sections of the city, planning and building anew.4 Ed Bacon's PCPC was certainly of its time in this respect and forceful in its place, stirring up both wonder and backlash. The old industrial city, the city that had lain fallow through the Depression and World War II, was awakening slowly to the possibility of highrises and integrated transportation hubs, and at the same time rediscovering its walkable character and the vernacular beauties of its historic neighborhoods. Bacon's idea was to liberate William Penn's grid from over a century of industrial-age clutter and to make the city simultaneously auto-, pedestrian-, and investment-friendly. Bacon understood the power of display and salesmanship as keys to making his idea of the next Philadelphia into something tangible. In this spirit, his \"2009\" essay arrived on newsstands in 1959. Could new high-rises and a suburban-style shopping center downtown reverse massive job losses and a suburban exodus? Whether the PCPC's projects were comprehensive enough remained an open question in 1959. In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The \"2009\" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's \"2009\" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the \"master planner\" and by extension New Deal\/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009.\".

Grant and Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil entered Machinery Hall to open the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Since early morning, the day's 186,000 attendees had been streaming through the gates. The president and the emperor stood in front of thirteen acres of motionless machinery, all connected by pulleys, shafts, wheels and belts to the giant Corliss engine in the central transept. Several hundred invited guests, already waiting there, made room for the ceremonial party to climb upon the concrete base of the huge metal monster towering forty feet above their heads almost to the trussed roof of the Hall. Machinery Hall was one of five major buildings put up by exhibition organizers in Fairmount Park; outside groups built dozens more. The Main Building was the largest in the world at the time-over a third of a mile long. Visitors marveled at the items on display: A typewriter, Hires root beer, the Statue of Liberty's torch, the Westinghouse air brake, Fleischmann's yeast, cable from the Brooklyn Bridge, Bell's telephone, and Otis's elevator.2 The Centennial was a resounding success, dramatically displaying Philadelphia's wealth and industrial might. Over nine million people-nearly one-fifth of the country's population-attended before its close in November. It was the first international exposition held in the United States and probably the single most important cultural event of its era. Foreigners flocked to Philadelphia-inaugurating mass tourism to the United States-to see American industrial innovations and dozens of foreign exhibits from Britain, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Japan, China, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and \"two large Arab tents.\" This influx of visitors and national cultures also opened Philadelphia andthe United States to a world of new influences; the Japanese exhibit in particular stirred an Oriental design fashion in the United States.3 Beyond the pomp, the fanfare, the hotel receipts, and the visitors, the Centennial also helped restructure the city's politics. The event both cemented networks of alliances among previously divided elites and marked the ascendance of a Republican hegemony in local political culture that would be virtually unchallenged for the next sixty years. The Republican regime that coalesced in the 1870s combined several elements: party bossism centered in control of several city agencies, an electoral machine that came to trade votes for public construction contracts, business support based in ideological solidarity (support for protectionist legislation), and reliance on rail- And port-related industries as the engine of the city's economy. In Philadelphia's case, the irony is that those Republicans who did the most to make the Centennial happen-large, reformist civic organizations like the Union League that played crucial roles in event planning and in promoting commitment to the Republican Party-did not necessarily enjoy the political fruits of their labors. Over time, the elite's cultural and ideological commitment to Republicanism became a straitjacket, and they lost control of the polity they had helped build. More broadly, I use the example of the Centennial to examine the role that cultural projects play in urban governance. These projects, and the planning efforts that produce them, contribute to the emergence and consolidation of governing regimes out of situations of extreme political discord and fragmentation. They connect processes of elite network formation (social capital) and ideological consolidation. These two processes in turn are the building blocks of hegemony in local governance-cultural and social leadership that shapes people's political commitments and the extent to which they are willing to consider or pursue alternatives to prevailing arrangements. \u00a9 2006 by Temple University Press.

Urban indicators and performance measurement are the answers, aiming to improve local performance on key trends and contribute to solving global problems. Better information, according to the rational model that predominates in urban policy, is the surest path to improve action. The World Urban Forum (WUF) III, meeting in Vancouver in June 2006, considers dimensions, challenges, and practices in the use of urban indicators in the Vancouver region. Patrick Geddes, writing in the early days of the town and regional planning movement, insisted upon the value of what he called a synoptic view, \"a seeing of the city and this as a whole; like Athens from its Acropolis\" (Geddes, 1949, p. 6). Working from a synoptic view did not simply mean gazing down on the city from atop a hill. Geddes strove to help people express \"simultaneity\" of their own being. Understanding that people living in a given region have a multitude of different perspectives, simultaneity of being meant \"one-ness with the social ideals, the scientific developments and the physical conditions of [their] own time and place\" (Geddes, 1949, p. x). He believed a region could be created and planned to aid people in accomplishing all these things. As one of the forefathers of town and regional planning, Geddes himself was a maker of \"great maps and diagrams and charts\" (Geddes, 1949, p. xiii)-but his most lasting contribution to the profession and practice of planning was his notion of the Civic Exhibition. Geddes was less concerned about expert training to make great plans and planners than he was \"concerned that the ordinary citizen should have a vision and a comprehension of the possibilities of his own city\" (Geddes, 1949, p. xi). A periodic Civic Exhibition, during which citizens could gather in a festive atmosphere to peruse plans, gaze at large maps and models, discuss and interpret these publicly, was one part of Geddes's key contribution to this goal. The other part was his drive to create a permanent and public centre for Civic Studies in every town in the form of an \"Outlook Tower\"(Geddes, 1949, p. xi). The Outlook Tower was to be the \"incipient Civic Observatory and Laboratory together\" in which the Science of Cities was advanced to its proper rank amongst academic and life pursuits (Geddes, 1949, p. 96). The institution Geddes sought to create placed \"its effort towards correlation of thought and action, science and practice, sociology and morals, with its watchword and endeavour of \"Civic Survey for Civic Service\"\" (Geddes, 1949, p. 69). Fastforward to late 2004, when the Urban Studies Program at Simon Fraser University's downtown campus initiated the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu), with a vision akin to that of Geddes. In the context of the new millennium, RVu was established as the first local observatory within UN-Habitat's Global Urban Observatory network in a developed country. The Global Urban Observatory was established in 1997 to institutionalize UN-Habitat's pioneering work in the generation and tracking of urban indicators, initiated with the Urban Indicators Programme in 1993. Following the creation of the Habitat Agenda at the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul in 1996, the mission was set for the Global Urban Observatory-to create and maintain a Global Urban Indicators Database that would permit UN member states and their cities to monitor and report on urban trends on a regular and reliable basis. The Millennium Development Goals, established by UN member states in 2000, and the indicators established for tracking these eight goals in 2003, update the mission of the Global Urban Indicators Database (UN-Habitat 2004). The MDGs represent a global compact for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, to be attained by 2015. RVu's work to date is being presented to the international community for the first time at the World Urban Forum III. The work thus far has constituted both expert-based and public participatory components. Experts affiliated with RVu have conducted regional and international research on urban indicator-related work, with some bearing on the Vancouver region and on specific indicators used by a range of projects in the major areas of urban capital: health, economy, environment, governance, culture, and infrastructure. Work in progress toward these research articles was presented at the first RVu public event, Focusing ouR View, in October 2005; and the best finished results are presented in this issue of Cities. Keys to the design of Rvu, and in particular its public participatory process, are presented in the first article in this issue, Urban Indicators and the Integrative Ideals of Cities, by Meg Holden. The paper presents the practice in progress of RVu's stance on urban sustainability as a community-based struggle to learn, indicators as a means for long-term learning, and the role of value-based citizen participation, within a theoretical perspective. Sustainable development, as a framework for long-term planning, has value in the Vancouver region for its \"constructive ambiguity\"(Robinson, 2004, p. 374), its pointers toward greater linkages among environmental, social, and economic priorities, without forcing a premature set of quantitative trade-offs. This integrative, vague, idealistic thrust also leaves sustainable development open to clashes with incremental, specific, and realist demands competing for time on the public agenda. Indicators can help bridge the gap; the articles in this issue begin to explain how. One article presents a bridge from the perspective of environmental economics, illustrating the complexities of measuring natural capital but also the need and precedent for this. The next article presents a way of thinking about indicators of governance for sustainable development from a starting point of allocating equal value to democratic inclusion of each citizen. Moving from the individual to the group, the final two articles ask for greater attention to socially, culturally and demographically-specific cases: new immigrants and Aboriginal people. Nancy Olewiler offers an economist's perspective on the design and utility of an urban indicator project, with a particular focus on natural capital. Her article, Environmental Sustainability for Urban Areas: The Role of Natural Capital Indicators, expands on one of the themes from Holden, the difference between descriptive indicators, which proliferate in policy contexts, and diagnostic indicators, which are rare. Olewiler presents the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and reminds us of the need to consider different indicators at each point in the chain. Her treatment of natural capital indicator issues locally includes useful information on Greater Vancouver's adjacent Fraser Valley Regional District. She looks south to the city of Santa Monica, California for an example of natural capital indicator development and institutionalization. Building on a theme introduced by Holden, Olewiler reminds us that indicators alone are not enough; effective indicators are those presented in a reasoned context with a clear path to actions. Indicators belong at the beginning, not the end, of a good governance process. The next article specifies much more clearly what might be meant by the notion of good governance. In Designing Good Urban Governance Indicators: The Importance of Citizen Participation and its Evaluation in Greater Vancouver, political scientist Kennedy Stewart makes the case for inclusion of governance considerations in any definition of sustainability. The political aspect of sustainability is poorly developed, compared to economic, environmental, and social aspects and this article moves the thinking ahead through treatment of democratic theory, along with work on defining 'good governance' advanced by the United Nations. Stewart draws on evidence of voting patterns in the Vancouver region to raise the spectre of systematic disenfranchisement, that seems to be on the rise. As Canada's only unamalgamated major metropolitan region, led by municipal appointments rather than direct elections, advances in sustainable development policy made by the Greater Vancouver Regional District are at risk if voting trends cannot be reversed. Stewart calls for stepwise moral reasoning, based on the premise of universal equal rights to rectify this wrong. The final two articles examine the limits of belonging to the project of sustainability in the Vancouver region, from the perspective of the region's newest residents and its ancestral residents. Robert Fiedler, Nadine Schuurman and Jennifer Hyndman, in Hidden Homelessness: An Indicator - Based Approach for Examining the Geographies of Recent Immigrants At-Risk of Homelessness in Greater Vancouver, focus on the dimensions of risk of homelessness amongst one particularly vulnerable group, new immigrants. This investigation brings to the fore the interaction of policies, economics, and cultures in explaining the complexities of homelessness and immigration trends in the region. Since about half of the region's population growth in the foreseeable future will come from international immigration, and an increasing proportion of new arrivals face socio-economic difficulties upon arrival, understanding these interactions is key to sustainability in a context of increasing cultural diversity and decreasing affordability of housing. First Nations researcher Nathan Cardinal puts an Aboriginal lens on indicators in his concluding article, The Exclusive City: Identifying, Measuring and Drawing Attention to Aboriginal and Indigenous Experiences in an Urban Context. Along with immigrants, Aboriginal groups constitute fast growing demographic cultural groups in British Columbia.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Holden M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2006.03.002","x":3.4500000477,"y":5.0900001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":262,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2005,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Noise, music, and the meaning of modernity","Abstract":"Emily Thompson has shared her views on a revised version of a talk from 'The Soundscape of Modernity: Architectural Acoustics and the Culture of Listening in America' that was presented to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Physique et d\u0301Histoire Naturelle de Gen\u00e9ve on 22nd October, 2004.

Urban livability is often measured based on various measurable aspects such as stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure as stated in EIU's Global Liveability Ranking. However, these indicators often neglect the nature and processes by which places are made that form people's sense of place much more than the physical availability of urban amenities. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the critical perspective and contribution that placemaking brings to the measures of urban livability. This theoretical study analyzes key concepts and frameworks from secondary data such as reports and journal papers with the inductive content analysis method. Through the lens of placemaking principles, the gaps in many urban livability measures are identified. It is proposed that urban livability measure should incorporate placemaking principles of being community-driven, local assets, bottom-up, and trans-disciplinary to enhance the human-environment quality of urban livability. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Christy F., Raissa G., Sihotang S., Wijaya K.","DOI":"10.1088\/1755-1315\/764\/1\/012016","x":2.7899999619,"y":6.5300002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":275,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Offending sights and urban governance: Expectations of city aesthetics and spatial responses to the unsightly","Abstract":"The problem of incivilities seems to be considerably connected to the visibility of unsightly behaviour. Factors such as urban attractiveness and visibility of the homelessness play important roles in urban social control and have led to the sanitisation and gentrification of city centres. Visual exposure is also relevant to how people perceive and respond to crime. In times of Selfie Culture, where it seems particularly important to some people that the background of their image is beautiful and (Insta)grammable, the right to expose one\u2019s unappetising vulnerability (e.g. homelessness) to the public may clash with others\u2019 beliefs in their entitlement to not see anything ugly or with expectations for urban space to be ordered according to mainstream norms of aesthetic acceptability. The chapter, first, addresses the visibility of incivilities, framing the regulation of offending sights within the gaze-dependent culture. Next, it looks at the contemporary urban responses to the vulnerable groups many deem unsightly, focusing in particular on the spatial-defensive measures aimed at removing certain marginal groups, such as the homeless and youth, from urban space. It then critically examines the wider societal and normative implications of such social control. The chapter concludes with some reflections on defensive architecture within securitised society, and policy considerations. \u00a9 2021 selection and editorial matter, Nina Per\u0161ak and Anna Di Ronco.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Per\u0161ak N.","DOI":"10.4324\/9781003092643-5","x":2.9900000095,"y":7.1199998856},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":279,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Cognitive-Cultural Looping Mechanism of Urban Space Conceptualization","Abstract":"A crucial point for urban design is the acknowledgement that urban material structures are not only constituting a set of cognitive-cultural affordances that shapes people\u2019s behavior and experiential world, but likewise that the design process itself is an expression of cultural conceptualizations possibly evoked by ongoing cultural practices and perceptions, thus forming a dynamic loop.

Methodology: Engineering learning from earthquakes, based on a long-term seismic culture, became a continuous activity based on field observation, since more than a century. On the other hand, creating earthquake disaster prevention awareness and disaster preparedness can be achieved nowadays by education and active learning addressed to all levels of population, from elder generations to the younger ones, and from usual people to the representatives of authorities. The link between these two approaches is becoming more and more necessary in the context of high local seismicity: investigating the behavior of people, while using emerging technologies (computer-generated imagery, immersive virtual reality etc.), to obtain an active individual attitude. The general concept of awareness and preparedness trends evolved. To deal with earthquake-related situations, people are taught to take measures to prevent severe earthquakes effects, but we must take a step forward to get closer to the system that includes: research knowledge, innovation, GIS and specialized software, and more importantly, the access to all of these, through public and private involvement.

However, due to rapid population growth in the floating villages, the present situation shows lacks in urban planning, waste management and development of infrastructure. Ha Long Bay had suffered the pressure of environmental pollution and resource degradation. Since 2014, in order to protect the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the local authority has planned a project to demolish the floating villages and move these communities to the mainland. In fact, the demolition project has caused the loss of cultural heritage and a tourist attraction in Ha Long Bay. The goal of this study is to propose a sustainable concept of living space organization for Cua Van, the largest floating village in Ha Long Bay, in order to preserve, revive, and promote floating communities as a unique heritage culture and tourist attraction. Therefore, a detailed analysis of environment and socio-cultural, economic, architectural characteristics of Cua Van is provided in this study. The analysis does not only accumulate precious traditional values that need to be preserved and developed in the proposed concept but also illustrate its weakness that need to be addressed to optimally design the future sustainable floating village. Based on these studies, as well as on general principles of a sustainable floating community and promoting ecotourism, the study proposes a living space concept for Cua Van, including solutions to both a sustainable floating community adapting to climate change and ecotourism development.

These interaction flows are considered smart for making strategic use of infrastructure, services, information and communication with urban planning and management to meet social and economic needs of society.

This chapter highlights the significance of the market\u2019s historical particularities and authentic sense of place, which are reflective of the people who have inhabited the marketplace. It also problematizes the outward-looking nature of the Jagalchi Market Modernization, which is represented by the architectural design of the new Jagalchi Market building and the street renovation project targeting outside visitors, and it discusses the unique sense of place that was either neglected or compromised during the process of market modernization. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Author Keywords":"Collective place experience; Sense of place; Traditional market modernization; Urban design","Authors":"Lee S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-72311-2_6","x":2.6300001144,"y":8.3299999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":332,"Cited by":null,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Design and implementation of human mobility embedded system for urban planning of smart city","Abstract":"The mobility model will help us to simulate the movements of people more realistic as in real case. This paper developed human mobility system using random way point and random walk methods to model the individual movement of person in different places within area of Baghdad, Iraq. There are a lot of types of mobility model but we use Random Way Point (RWP) because it is simple, most common use and needs less memory and time for computation. The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city. Al-Sadar city is one of biggest population city in Baghdad, Iraq. It has three millions people population. We choose 5000 users moves from Al-Sadar city to two different places in Baghdad: Al- Khadmia and Al-Zawra. Al-Khadmiia is old and religion place and Al-Zawra is biggest public garden in Baghdad. In our work, we find the best ways that connect Al-Sadar city with both places. We decide the best ways depending on distances and traffic between them. It gives good method to build smart transportation and smart city using mobility and traffic models. .This paper will help urban decision maker to suggest the analytical model for urban space and have a clear picture about the city: how can it change, how do the people move in the city, what are the problems and how can solve them to generate smart city. \u00a9 2017 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

They are planning central city areas under the principles of DRR as well as BBB. There are too many laws pertaining to disaster prevention and reconstruction to refer to in full here. Therefore, this chapter focuses only on some of the new enactments after the GEJE. But attention has to be paid to their approaches to reconstruction when it comes to the question of whether they sufficiently concord with DRR and BBB (Ikuta 2013; Kaneko 2014). The Basic Act on Reconstruction in Response to the GEJE 2011 (hereinafter the Basic Act 2011) prescribes that, considering the unprecedented national crisis caused by the GEJE, the act has the purpose of promoting the smooth and prompt reconstruction and revitalization of a vibrant Japan, securing financial resources, identifying afflicted areas as Special Zones for Reconstruction with institutional and tax measures and establishing a Reconstruction Agency to undertake tasks regarding integrated national measures (Art. 1). The Basic Act 2011 then prescribes its basic philosophy, adopting the idea of the building back better concept, promoting dramatic measures for revitalization that are not limited to physical recovery of afflicted facilities, but also reconstruction measures to assist individuals to overcome the disaster and lead prosperous lives while honoring local culture and enhancing people\u2019s ties with the community (Art. 2). The Act for Special Zones for Reconstruction 2011 was enacted as separate legislation from the Basic Act 2011 to implement the reconstruction measures. Under this legislation, afflicted local governments designated as special areas can acquire significantly larger budget funds from the national government for recovery and can deregulate their spatial planning under the Agricultural Land Act, the Forest Act and the Urban Planning Act. Via this funding and deregulation, they can plan recovery-related projects for disaster prevention: the promotion of collective relocation, functional reinforcement of fishery villages, land reallocation for the revival of affected city areas, basic construction to lead city centers towards recovery from the tsunami and disaster-resistant public housing. The Act on Town Planning for Tsunami Disaster Prevention 2011 allows prefectural governments to set tsunami hazard zones and municipal governments to make integrated town plans for tsunami disaster prevention. Under the act, prefectural governments can set the presumed tsunami hazard zones and special tsunami warning zones. In the latter zone, normal town planning and building activities are restricted. \u00a9 2016 Yuka KANEKO, Katsumi MATSUOKA and Toshihisa TOYODA.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Matsuoka K.","DOI":"10.4324\/9781315680323-25","x":3.9700000286,"y":5.3499999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":339,"Cited by":null,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Cultural planning and sustainable development","Abstract":"A decade or more has elapsed since the notion of cultural planning was distinguished from the more functional planning for arts and culture within amenity, heritage, land use and economic resource planning systems. The \u2018cultural turn\u2019 in town and spatial planning which emerged from the 1970s and 1980s has taken longer to establish itself than say in geography (Barnes 2001, Crang 1997), political economy (Soja 1999) and sociology (Chaney 1994). Planning as a hybrid practice has adopted culture - at least partially - to better inform more sustainable approaches to scarce land use and amenity needs and to respond to diversity and planning cultures. On the other hand it has also rediscovered culture in order to address aspirations and visions of city planning itself as a \u2018work of art\u2019 (Boyer 1988, Munro 1967, Talen and Ellis 2004). Different approaches and rationales for cultural planning have therefore emerged, rather than a single grand theory or conceptual model (see also Bianchini, Chapter 22, this volume). This is in part due to the epistemological and definitional differences evident in these approaches towards \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018planning\u2019 and their combination, and in part to cultural politics that views the very idea of planning for culture as inherently instrumental in maintaining cultural and growth hegemonies - both market and state-led. Kunzmann\u2019s aspiration (above) towards creativity in planning also conflates the practice of town planners withcomplex notions of city culture, environment and identity. The notion of the creative city has also extended the cultural planning sphere to the creative industries (\u2018economy\u2019) and issues of place-making, design quality and sustainability. Place-making - like New Urbanism (CEU 2004) - whilst usefully focusing on the street, urban design, mixed-use, local accessibility, \u2018sense of place\u2019 and so on, can also be seen as a rejection or failure of planning in terms of the wider scale and the whole, distributed population (Evans 2010). Everywhere is a \u2018place\u2019, not just the valorized spaces which tend to feature in place-making agendas and guidance (APA 2011, Markusen and Gadwa 2010), and which are preoccupied with town centres and regeneration sites (physical, economy) at the expense of the everyday, residential areas and cultural activity (people). \u00a9 2013 Greg Young and Deborah Stevenson.

Indigenous knowledge is accessible, useful and cheap. Its perspective is holistic and its transmission is verbal. Knowledge is dynamic and time-tested, and while it has grown within local natural and social environment, so it is very sustainable with indigenous condition. Indigenous knowledge refers to both component and whole part of culture of each nation and this component and whole integration is so that stop to change traditional society of life without indigenous knowledge out of its cultural origin and therefore would lose it concept and effectiveness. in recent decades following issues had been recognized very essential: programming and performing development plans, indigenous knowledge at farming, pest control, ranching, veterinary, nutrition, medicine, watershed management, foresting, architecture, urban planning, social associations and decision making method as sustainable technology. At on hand, reason of this great evolution can be found due to wrong policy and at the other hand in undesirable environmental consequences of these policies. Indigenous knowledge is different with scientific knowledge that was established by universities and scientific communities. This knowledge is basis for decision making at field of agriculture, health, education, food and natural sources Indigenous knowledge is set of all knowledge and skills that people enjoy in one geographical area (in one environmental conditions) that most of their skills and knowledge be transmitted to next generation, and new generation would be adapted with them and add to it Since, each knowledge is consequent of individual interaction with environment, so indigenous knowledge is consequent of indigenous people interaction with their environment.","Author Keywords":"Agriculture; Indigenous knowledge","Authors":"Arjmandi H., Mardani H., Nazeri M.","DOI":null,"x":0.9200000167,"y":5.7399997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":381,"Cited by":null,"Year":2007,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Words and music","Abstract":"Aboriginals-related publications in Taiwan are becoming richer in content and style due to the growing concerns for aboriginal issues and the effort to promote aboriginal cultures.

This society reached its peak during the classic period, which extended from 250 BC to 900 AD. During their 2000-year history, the Maya held domain over a powerful Empire ruled by City States. The Maya Empire established a scientifically based culture while Europe languished in the Dark Ages. During their classic period, the Maya developed numerous scientific and engineering advancements. These ingenious people developed a mathematical system that recognized the concept of the number zero seven hundred years before the Europeans; a calendar system that is more advanced than our current calendar; ingenious engineering applications including manufacturing of cement, clear span cast-in-place concrete structures; and a complex infrastructure that served the needs of their sophisticated and highly populated ceremonial urban centers. Around 700 AD the Maya achieved an exceptional feat in civil engineering history with the construction of a long-span suspension bridge across the Usumacinta River at the ceremonial center at Yaxchilan. The 63 meter center span was the longest in the world until Italian engineers constructed a 76 meter bridge over the Adda River in northern Italy in 1377.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"O'Kon J.A.","DOI":null,"x":4.9299998283,"y":5.4099998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":387,"Cited by":null,"Year":2005,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Life in Long Beach","Abstract":"Long beach, with almost a half a million people is the second largest city in the Los Angeles basin.

To this end the Ministry of Water Resources published the first National Water Policy in 1999,whereas the paper focuses the Regional Water Management Plan (RWMP) with the intention of guiding both public and private actions in the future for ensuring optimal development and management of water that benefits both individuals and the society at large. This Paper aims to ensure progress towards fulfilling national goals of economic development, poverty alleviation, food security, public health and safety, decent standard of living for the people and protection of the natural environment. The Plan is presented in three phases: in the short-term (2000-05) it is considered a firm plan of ongoing and new activities; in the medium-term (2006-10) it is an indicative plan, and in the long-term (2011-25) a perspective plan. Implementation of the plan is to be monitored regularly and it will be updated every five years (IWRM, 2002). Water is central to the way of life in Bangladesh. Indeed, the river systems, many of which emanate from outside the country, have shaped much of the history, economy, literature and rich culture of the people. However, with a burgeoning population of 129 million expected to rise to 181 million by 2025 and to 224 million by 2050 (IWRM, 2002), the country faces many challenges ahead in an era of increasing globalization. Rapid urbanization is expected with 40% of people living in the towns and major cities by 2025, and 60% by 2050 (WARPO, 2001). Poverty is still endemic with over half the population classified as poor. In addressing these and other related issues, this paper sets new paradigms for the water sector, which include: decentralized water management; cost sharing and cost recovery; private sector participation; community participation; nontraditional financing modalities; regulation separated from supply; and new rights, obligations and accountability.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Hafiz R., Chowdhury S., Sultana S.","DOI":null,"x":1.5700000525,"y":5.3899998665}]
