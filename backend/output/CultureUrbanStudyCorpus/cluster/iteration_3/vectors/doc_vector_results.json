between sensory perception of natural environments and human health. Our hypothesis is that people perceive green spaces in terms of certain dimensions, where some dimensions are more important and preferred than others with respect to restoring people from stress. The aims are to: identify and describe the perceived dimensions in nature; identify which dimensions people in general prefer; identify the dimensions people reporting stress prefer; and identify a combination of the dimensions people reporting stress prefer. A total of 953 randomly selected informants from nine Swedish cities (representative of the Swedish population) answered a postal questionnaire with pre-coded questions. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: personal data, preferences for natural qualities and self-estimations of health status. The data were analyzed using factor analysis and regression analyses. The results identify and describe eight perceived sensory dimensions. People in general prefer the dimension Serene, followed by Space, Nature, Rich in Species, Refuge, Culture, Prospect and Social. The dimensions Refuge and Nature are most strongly correlated with stress, indicating a need to find the most restorative environments. A combination of Refuge, Nature and Rich in Species, and a low or no presence of Social, could be interpreted as the most restorative environment for stressed individuals. From a city planning perspective, the results indicate how urban green spaces can be viewed as elements of importance to public mental health. However, before the dimensions can be used by practitioners as tools to promote health through city planning, more research is needed. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

the focal point of their research. They are successful in presenting new findings about landscapes within their specialisation, but collaboration - and thus, transfer of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries - is seldom realised because a common approach that bridges the gaps between disciplines is missing. Instead, different landscape concepts exist side by side. Yet, cooperation is required to tackle the various environmental and social problems related to landscapes. This paper provides an overview of the historical development of landscape concepts originating from different cultural and scientific trends, and presents a new complex concept of landscape, which is designed to enable transdisciplinary landscape research. The transdisciplinary landscape concept is based on five dimensions of landscapes: the spatial entity, the mental entity, the temporal dimension, the nexus of nature and culture, and the systemic properties of landscapes. In contrast to other approaches, it unites dimensions that are usually the domain of individual disciplines and makes it, thus, possible to capitalise on plurality in landscape research. The concept promotes landscape as the combination of the subsystems known as the geo-, bio- and noo-sphere, and is illustrated by the people-landscape interaction model. The concept can be applied to all human-landscape-related research, but is exemplified by two studies that have investigated the relationship between landscape and second-home tourism, and landscape and farming, respectively. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This implicit refusal to grant sensory information and affective processing the power to catalyze and inform serious reflection is not new; neither is the attribution of popular landscape aesthetics to the elite society of a limited culture and historical period surprising, given the current preponderance of post-modernist sensibilities.

As social scientists, we suggest that attempts to impose prescribed environmental aesthetics (albeit ecologically pure environmental aesthetics) are inappropriate and may well be self-defeating.

Factor analysis was used as well to infer images of appropriate relationship, which appeared to hinge around the concepts of mastery over nature, responsibility for nature and participation in nature, respectively. Levels of adherence to the responsibility and participation images were very high, indicative of a 'new biophilia' mainstream in Dutch culture. Landscape types were defined, roughly, as (1) landscape made by and for people; (2) park-like, arcadian landscape; (3) wild, interactive landscape and (4) landscape \"in which one may experience the greatness and forces of nature\". Strikingly, more than half of the respondents expressed preference for this last ('deep ecology') landscape type, with another third preferring the wild, interactive landscape. The highest preference of the 'greatness and forces' landscape was found among the respondents with high ascription of naturalness to the penetrative type of nature and respondents adhering to the participation-in-nature image of relationship. Preferences for landscape types as defined here should be distinguished from visual or behavioral landscape preferences. Even if people may not select landscapes of the 'greatness and forces of nature' in daily behaviors, these landscapes of wilderness and greatness do connect with human visions and desires. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

current prospects for and obstacles facing the implementation of social impact assessment (SIA) and participatory planning in the People's Republic of China.

In general, Old Damascus, with its deep canyons, is more comfortable in summer than modern Damascus where there is a lack of shade.

Urbanisation has multiple political, cultural, environmental and economic dimensions that profoundly influence social development and innovation. This fundamental long-term transformation will involve the realignment of urban society\u2019s technologies and infrastructures, culture and lifestyles, as well as governance and institutional frameworks. Such structural systemic realignments can be referred to as urban sustainability transitions: fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent societal challenges are addressed, such as shifts towards urban farming, renewable decentralised energy systems, and social economies. This book provides new insights into how sustainability transitions unfold in different types of cities across the world and explores possible strategies for governing urban transitions, emphasising the co-evolution of material and institutional transformations in socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. With case studies of mega-cities such as Seoul, Tokyo, New York and Adelaide, medium-sized cities such as Copenhagen, Cape Town and Portland, and nonmetropolitan cities such as Freiburg, Ghent and Brighton, the book provides an opportunity to reflect upon the comparability and transferability of theoretical\/conceptual constructs and governance approaches across geographical contexts.

in Mathare Valley Slums, Nairobi","Abstract":"The growth of peri-urban areas is increasingly recognised as a dominant planning and urban design challenge for the 21st century. In burgeoning poor urban settlements growing on city margins, autonomous adaptation strategies are often the only measures to respond to increasing climatic and compounding stressors. Yet, in both research and practice there remains lack of understanding regarding the dynamics of adaptation and risk reduction at the level of the community. In this paper, we argue urban slums are ideal places to consider adaptation because they offer examples of more extreme social-ecological stress than one finds in more established communities - the kind we can anticipate more broadly in the face of climate change. A framework for identifying local adaptation processes is presented and applied to analyse the case of Mathare Valley Slums in Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated suburb, where residents are regularly exposed to flooding from heavy rainfall. Findings reveal that slums, often viewed as illegitimate, makeshift, and temporary settlements, are places experienced by many residents as permanent communities characterised by rapid environmental change. Processes of adaptation in Mathare have become institutionalised through time, as a new generation of people imagine themselves staying and (re)organise to achieve a higher level of functioning through various strategies to reduce risk. Innovative and revitalising adaptation occurs as residents shift from employing more generic and expected coping strategies, such as evacuating homes or economic diversification, to creating \"gated\" communities and savings schemes to maintain and improve the settlement, despite uncertain tenure. Both formal and informal institutions, such as youth groups, play an important role in governing such heterogeneous localities, incrementally upgrading the slum and providing critical public services. Long-term residents' increasing recognition of the permanence of the slum community and its stressful conditions appears to lead to more collective action toward adaptation pathways. However, this is in marked contrast to the dominant non-local perspective of Mathare's status as both impermanent and illegal, which prevails among government officials. As such, strategies are generally not incorporated into planned interventions. While progressive policies designed to reduce risk exist, they remain nascent in their establishment and fail to benefit slumdwellers. The case illustrates the need to incorporate the wealth of knowledge, techniques, and experience extant at the community level in the development of adaptation planning. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Autonomous adaptation; Climate change; Flooding; Mathare valley slums; Urban slums; Urbanisation","Authors":"Thorn J., Thornton T.F., Helfgott A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.gloenvcha.2014.12.009","Text":"Autonomous adaptation to global environmental change in peri-urban settlements: Evidence of a growing culture of innovation and revitalisation in Mathare Valley Slums, Nairobi.

multiple levels of meaning: it articulates the ideological intent of the powerful who plan or shape the landscape in particular ways and at the same time reflects the everyday meanings implicit in the daily routines of ordinary people associated with the landscape. Through an analysis of four themes constituting the landscape of Singapore's Chinatown, we unpack two different but interdependent versions of landscape reality: the construction of social meanings from the state's perspective and those derived from the lived experiences of Chinatown's inhabitants. In our first theme, we explore the multiplicity of meanings invested in Chinatown's housing landscape. For the state, urban renewal and public housing schemes in Chinatown represent the redrawing of landscapes along modernist lines informed by efficiency and rationality of land use, in tandem with the larger goals of nation-building. Among residents, however, the vision of modern living in everyday life was only a reality for a few; others experience the landscape in more contradictory ways. Second, in the landscape of community building, we show that state-initiated efforts at inculcating a sense of community have replaced the old spontaneous, interpersonal ties and the strength of organised vernacular associations. Inadvertently, these state strategies have in some ways actually been damaging and deleterious to community ties. In our third theme, we show how the state has, to a large extent, successfully rewritten the socially and physically polluted landscapes of Chinatown. Yet, there are examples of resistances where the state's vision of an unpolluted landscape has been punctured. Since the mid-1980s, a fourth imperative has emerged in the state's management of the Chinatown landscape in the form of attempts to conserve the landscape as a \"historic district\", a repository of the nation's tradition, history and culture. We show that there are different interpretations of the state's effort to revitalise Chinese culture in the conserved landscape and its attempt to cast Chinatown in the role of a \"common bond place\" for all Singaporeans.

matter?","Abstract":"Climate-sensitive open spaces within cities may have a positive effect on economic, social and environmental aspects of the urban environment. Improvement of microclimatic conditions in urban spaces can enable people to spend more time outdoors, with the potential to influence the social cohesion of a space and increase economic activity. The wider aim of this research is to develop a better understanding of the complex relationship between the microclimate and human behaviour in open public spaces in hot arid climates. Case studies are selected in two different parts of the world (Marrakech in North Africa and Phoenix, Arizona in the US) to represent a variety of users in a similar climatic context. This enables the authors to study the effects of socio-economic and cultural diversity on thermal comfort, behaviour and use of space. Field surveys include structured interviews with a standard questionnaire and observations of human activities, along with microclimatic monitoring, carried out during the summers and winters of 2008 and 2009. The analysis consists of: microclimatic influence on thermal sensation, preference and people attendance; effect of psychological adaptation on the subjective thermal evaluation of outdoor spaces; and investigation of socio-economic and socio-cultural impact on the behaviour of people in outdoor spaces. \u00a9 2010 Earthscan.","Author Keywords":"Hot climate; Microclimate; Outdoor thermal comfort; Socio-culture; Urban design","Authors":"Aljawabra F., Nikolopoulou M.","DOI":"10.3763\/inbi.2010.0046","Text":"Influence of hot arid climate on the use of outdoor urban spaces and thermal comfort: Do cultural and social backgrounds matter?.

metabolism has considered the perspective of environmental sustainability in the framework of cities. In this context, cities can be regarded complex entities driven by material and energy flows that entail consumption of resources and production of waste materials in the pursuit of economic welfare and social progress. According to a sustainability perspective, environmental, social and economic indicators must also be integrated into urban planning processes. However, methodological advances regarding the definition and development of sustainable cities are required since a consensus of indicators, weighting and data management is still lacking. In this paper, a multi-criteria approach that combines three methodologies: Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed and applied to a sample of 26 representative Spanish cities with different characteristics (i.e., population, location, demands, economy, topography and culture). The combined approach allows identifying the non-sustainable cities considering an offset of indicators from the three pillars of sustainability. With this purpose, the mentioned items are implemented in a DEA model of efficiency, being the inefficient cities with an efficiency score lower than 100% defined as non-sustainable ones. Finally, this multi-criteria method allows setting the target values for the assessed indicators (benchmarked values), which become objectives for the non-sustainable cities to evolve toward a more sustainable performance. The outcomes from the analysis have identified six cities that ranked worse, with efficiency scores ranging from 57.9% to 85.8%. According to the targets of socio-economic indicators, attention should be paid to AROPE rate (people at risk of poverty and social exclusion), unemployment rate and number of crimes, meanwhile lower levels of electricity consumption, municipal solid waste and on-site greenhouse gases emissions are desirable from an environmental perspective.

factors","Abstract":"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has been argued as part of the solution to prevalent transport problems. However, progress from pilots to large-scale implementation has hitherto been slow. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to empirically and in-depth investigate how, and to what extent, different factors affect the development and implementation of MaaS. A framework was developed, with a basis in institutional theory and the postulation that formal as well informal factors on different analytical levels (macro, meso and micro) must be considered. The research was organised as a multiple case study in Finland and Sweden and a qualitative approach was chosen for data collection and analysis. A number of factors with a claimed impact on the development and implementation of MaaS was revealed. At the macro level, these factors included legislation concerning transport, innovation and public administration, and the presence (or not) of a shared vision for MaaS. At the meso level, (the lack of) appropriate business models, cultures of collaboration, and assumed roles and responsibilities within the MaaS ecosystem were identified as significant factors. At the micro level, people's attitudes and habits were recognised as important factors to be considered. However, how the \u2018S\u2019 in MaaS fits (or not) the transport needs of the individual\/household appears to play a more important role in adoption or rejection of MaaS than what has often been acknowledged in previous papers on MaaS. The findings presented in this paper provide several implications for public and private sector actors. Law-making authorities can facilitate MaaS developments by adjusting relevant regulations and policies such as transport-related subsidies, taxation policies and the definition of public transport. Regional and local authorities could additionally contribute to creating conducive conditions for MaaS by, for example, planning urban designs and transport infrastructures to support service-based travelling. Moreover, private actors have key roles to play in future MaaS developments, as both public and private transport services are needed if MaaS is to become a viable alternative to privately owned cars. Thus, the advance of MaaS business models that benefit all involved actors is vital for the prosperity of the emerging MaaS ecosystem. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Barriers; Enablers; Formal institutions; Informal institutions; MaaS; Mobility-as-a-Service","Authors":"Karlsson I.C.M., Mukhtar-Landgren D., Smith G., Koglin T., Kronsell A., Lund E., Sarasini S., Sochor J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.tra.2019.09.028","Text":"Development and implementation of Mobility-as-a-Service \u2013 A qualitative study of barriers and enabling factors.

poor in Harare and Zimbabwean cities in general is a story of evictions, fear and misery. In May 2005, at the behest of the Government of Zimbabwe the infamous Operation Restore Order, a house demolition campaign left more than 700 thousand people homeless. Nearly a decade later, there are increased opportunities for improvement and change in the lives of the urban poor in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital city. The purpose of the paper is to present how the Harare Slum Upgrading Programme is creating and strengthening municipal and community partnerships to tackle city challenges in an inclusive manner. This research indicates the housing struggles of the urban poor and the emerging City-community engagement in urban services provision (water, sanitation, tenure security and roads) and changing municipal attitudes towards the urban poor. In particular, the article presents participatory urban planning and development, slum upgrading institutional structure, profiling and enumeration, and slum upgrading impacts (resilience of the urban poor, living in slums without fear, expansive pool of beneficiaries, review of planning regulations and land ownership) as major issues promoting inclusive municipal governance. Inclusivity is implemented through incremental development, which is allowing people to settle on land first and access municipal services gradually over time. Two main factors explain such positive steps towards inclusive governance in Harare. First are indications of gradual institutional change in which the City of Harare's governance culture is changing through 'opening up' and embracing the urban poor. Second, over the years, the urban poor have built a strong and vibrant alliance which is acting as a medium of participation in City governance. The paper concludes that slum upgrading sustainability at city-wide level requires active City participation and institutionalisation as opposed to a project based approach. Lastly, addressing concerns of the urban poor is susceptible to political contestations, requiring strong impartiality to counter such forces. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Citizen participation; Gradual institutional change; Harare; Housing; Inclusive municipal governance; Slum upgrading; Urban poor; Urban services; Zimbabwe","Authors":"Muchadenyika D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2015.03.003","Text":"Slum upgrading and inclusive municipal governance in Harare, Zimbabwe: New perspectives for the urban poor.

neoliberalism has made it not only one of the world's fastest growing economies, but also one of the most polarised states. This economic, social and political transformation has led to the emergence of a new Chinese middle class, and understanding the development and the role of this new social group is crucial to understanding contemporary Chinese society. Investigating the new politics of the middle class in China, this book addresses three major questions. First, how does the Chinese state deal with problems of national sovereignty and political representation to create the middle class both as a legitimate category of the people and as an ideal norm of citizenship? Second, how does the recognition of the middle class norm take place in the practice of everyday life? Finally, what kind of risks does the politics of the middle class generate not only for middle class subjects but also for the disenfranchised? In answering these questions, this book examines a set of practices, bodies of knowledge, measures, and institutions that aim to manage, govern, control, and orient the behaviours, gestures, and thoughts of Chinese citizens. This investigation contributes not only to the understanding of the Chinese middle class society but also to the scholarly debate over the relationship between governmental apparatuses, subjectification, and life-building. Drawing on ethnographic information, historical archives, and the media, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars working in the fields of Chinese studies, Chinese politics, ethnic studies and urban studies, as well as those interested in culture, society, class and welfare. \u00a9 2013 Hai Ren.

There were no systematic differences among the three cities with regard to activity disturbances indoors, but significant disturbance of activities and resting in gardens or on balconies was noted in Gothenburg. The difference in activity disturbance was due to the differences between lifestyles in the two countries.

This article identifies and criticizes two kinds of recent responses to these questions: the first is to defend an architecture of localism and containment in some new and some old ways; the second is to retreat into relativism, sometimes supported by the assertion that architecture is of limited consequence because society is increasingly independent of space. The article defends the view that we can and must be assertive about the architecture of cities in global rather than local terms. The experience of genuinely urban environments is about meeting, though not necessarily interacting with, other people, mostly unknown, who can be of recognizably different class, status, race or ethnic origin; it is also about exploring the strange, and becoming aware of, though not necessarily participating in, other ways of life. -from Author","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Peponis J.","DOI":null,"Text":"Space, culture and urban design in late modernism and after.

Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation? Spirited debate about its impacts on land uses and values has inspired vivid descriptions by both supporters and critics and spurred the imagination of artists and creative writers. Purpose: The UGB has become a symbol, metaphor, and touchstone, as people read complex meanings into it that go beyond its simple legal function. This article looks at the UGB as a cultural icon. It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media.Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives. Takeaway for practice: In the world of 21st-century planning theory there is a strong assumption that many voices engaged in overlapping conversations can help shape more equitable and sustainable cities. Creative depictions of Portland's UGB show the role of cultural actors in shaping and enriching such conversations.","Author Keywords":"Culture and regulation; Oregon; Urban growth boundary (UGB); Portland","Authors":"Abbott C., Margheim J.","DOI":"10.1080\/01944360801944997","Text":"Imagining Portland's urban growth boundary: Planning regulation as cultural icon.

objective of the present study was to explore preferences and eumotion perceptions of people in Rasht and Ardabil (Iran) to some ornamental plants in order to help designing appropriate urban green landscapes. The study surveyed urban park users in the two cities in 2017 to identify and compare the most important factors underpinning the viability of public open spaces from the perspective of users (mental aspect) and the extent to which these mental factors match the visual features of the selected spaces (visual aspect). A random sample of 232 individuals was taken from students in Ardabil (119 persons) and Rasht (113 persons). A considerable part of the participants (37.2%) reported a feeling of tranquility when they saw flowers, while 28.8% of the participants reported a feeling of love. Flower-bearing plant species were more appealing to the participants than leafy ornamental plants. Red was the most preferred flower color (52.1%) followed by violet (18.6%) and orange (11.4%) among the ornamental species commonly used in the design of green spaces, while tulip (Tulipa gesneriana) (29%), rose (Rosa hybrida) (25%), and Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) (19%) were in the first top ranks of preferences, respectively. Coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides) and garden croton (Codiaeum variegatum) were also reported among preferred species. The results support the assumption of similarity in preferences and requirements of citizens of large cities and despite great diversity in geography, culture, and ethics, people in large cities exhibit similar emotion perceptions. The study findings are expected to support public authorities and urban planners to effectively design and manage urban green spaces to meet users\u2019 needs. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Author Keywords":"Green space; Public perception; Sense of place; Urban landscape","Authors":"Rahnema S., Sedaghathoor S., Allahyari M.S., Damalas C.A., Bilali H.E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ufug.2018.12.007","Text":"Preferences and emotion perceptions of ornamental plant species for green space designing among urban park users in Iran.

of Qatar, has went through a fast growth in its economy and transformation of its built environment. Currently, major urban public transit systems are under construction. This paper looks at Souq Waqif station and its surrounding neighbourhood as one of the new transit hubs of Qatar. The district is located in the core of Doha and plays a significant role in the social, economic and particularly culture, as a way of life, of the people in Qatar. Within the context of Doha, there is an urge to implement transit villages, also defined as transit-oriented developments (TODs), in most of the existing centres along the rail network. A TOD is a mixed use commercial and residential area designed to maximise access to public transport and to encourage transit ridership. Therefore, it is critical to understand the benefits and impacts that TODs would invite in this context before investing large funds in developing them. The research empirically investigates the level at which transit villages can be implemented and also formed within the built environment of Doha. It is argued that this strategy and vision would encourage sustainable development by supporting better transport integration and land use. The aim is to assess and promote sustainable developments integration in the city of Doha through controlling increasing traffic and planning for transit villages. In order to develop a strategy for intervention, the existing TOD case study of Yeerongpilly in Australia was analysed, followed by the exploration of the conditions of the existing Souq Waqif area.

unique social-economic and political context for urban conservation and regeneration within the current trend of modernisation and globalisation.

Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing.

She currently lectures and researches in the Department of Tourism at the Dublin Institute of Technology. The nature and meaning of festivals and festivity in contemporary society is one of her key research interests and her work on the topic has been published in a number of international journals including Urban Studies, Social and Cultural Geography, Tourism Geographies, Event Management and the Journal of Policy Research in Tourism, Leisure and Events. Other research interests include the relationship between culture and tourism, leisure and social inclusion and contemporary forms of tourism mobility. Publications on these topics have appeared in the Annals of Tourism Research, Gender, Place and Culture and Leisure Studies as well as in various edited book collections. Her teaching interests mirror her research interests and she is involved in undergraduate and postgraduate tourism management and event management programmes teaching modules related to cultural tourism, international festival environments, tourism studies, and tourism and event policy.AcknowledgementsMy long-standing interest in festivals and events has been shaped by many people, both practitioners and academics, over the years. These people are too many to mention by name, but I owe all of them a debt of gratitude. While writing this book I was very fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of colleagues, particularly Lucy Horan and Ruth Craggs, as well as the support and encouragement of my other colleagues at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Finally, a huge thank you to John, Muireann and Aoife for absolutely everything.IntroductionIn 1991, Getz wrote that festivals and holiday events represented nouveau, alternative tourism (cited in Lee et al., 2008). How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of \u2018 risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of \u2018 emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature. Others, such as the sustainability of the sector's activities have been an issue for longer. Most recently of all, the question as to how festival and event activities are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated, in response to the harsh realities negatively affecting the health of the sector in very recent times. The 35 concepts that are discussed in this volume are laid out in alphabetical order. \u00a9 Bernadette Quinn 2013.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Quinn B.","DOI":"10.4135\/9781473914742","Text":"Key concepts in event management.

She currently lectures and researches in the Department of Tourism at the Dublin Institute of Technology. The nature and meaning of festivals and festivity in contemporary society is one of her key research interests and her work on the topic has been published in a number of international journals including Urban Studies, Social and Cultural Geography, Tourism Geographies, Event Management and the Journal of Policy Research in Tourism, Leisure and Events. Other research interests include the relationship between culture and tourism, leisure and social inclusion and contemporary forms of tourism mobility. Publications on these topics have appeared in the Annals of Tourism Research, Gender, Place and Culture and Leisure Studies as well as in various edited book collections. Her teaching interests mirror her research interests and she is involved in undergraduate and postgraduate tourism management and event management programmes teaching modules related to cultural tourism, international festival environments, tourism studies, and tourism and event policy.AcknowledgementsMy long-standing interest in festivals and events has been shaped by many people, both practitioners and academics, over the years. These people are too many to mention by name, but I owe all of them a debt of gratitude. While writing this book I was very fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of colleagues, particularly Lucy Horan and Ruth Craggs, as well as the support and encouragement of my other colleagues at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Finally, a huge thank you to John, Muireann and Aoife for absolutely everything.IntroductionIn 1991, Getz wrote that festivals and holiday events represented nouveau, alternative tourism (cited in Lee et al., 2008). How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of \u2018 risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of \u2018 emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature. Others, such as the sustainability of the sector's activities have been an issue for longer. Most recently of all, the question as to how festival and event activities are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated, in response to the harsh realities negatively affecting the health of the sector in very recent times.

presents a formidable challenge to sustainable development. We hypothesize that even when people hold negative attitudes toward unplanned development, natural property rights values (favorable evaluations of property as an inviolable and pre-political right) prevent them from acting on their concerns. We chose an intermountain west community as a case study to evaluate our hypothesis regarding natural property rights values. All groups were equally and strongly opposed to continuation of rapid unplanned growth, but those with natural property rights values were also adamantly opposed to land use planning. We used a multiple logistic regression model to evaluate the relationship between support for landscape planning and a natural property rights values. An overall significance test of the regression equation indicated the independent variables were significantly predictive of the dependent variable (\u03c72 128, 8 d.f., p &lt; 0.001) and had high (88.7%) predictive capacity. Natural property rights value was the most important predictor variable, but income was also significant. Sustainable landscape planning requires uncoupling property rights from inviolable and pre-political natural rights.

dwelling on old masonry walls are a rare urban ecological and landscape treasure.

This study aims to identify factors influencing public attitude toward this important but threatened natural-cum-cultural asset in a compact city milieu. Evidence is solicited from a face-to-face questionnaire survey involving 800 citizens of Hong Kong. Results indicate that Hong Kong people generally appreciate the existence of stonewall trees. Younger adults harbored doubts about their value, whereas the older ones were more sympathetic. Local residents of the suburbs that host the majority of stonewall trees registered stronger commitment than non-local residents. Community attachment had positive effects across both resident groups, but length of tenure was not a key factor. This suggests that affinity for stonewall trees is a function of the affective bonding between people and the community where they live.

factors which impact on the extent to which urban housing complies with residential standards in the city of Old Salt based in Jordan. The research found that the level of compliance with residential standards is quite low and can vary from one standard to another and from one house to another due to differences in the socio-economic characteristics among people. The findings of multiple regression analysis reveal that there is a good level of public awareness of residential standards, but this does not result in complete compliance with residential standards. Factors, such as household income per month, household size, finance facilities, municipal administration culture, monitoring, enforcement and the uncertainty of residential standards have a significant impact on the extent of compliance with planning standards. Suggestions for improved urban planning practices which address these issues are summarised in the paper and include reassessed current residential standards through comprehensive legal frameworks, linking residential standards with urban design approaches, changing planning practices, developing information systems to produce effective monitoring systems of construction processes and enforcement mechanisms, the development of local staff including planners, designers and environmental engineers, supported partnerships between private and public sectors, and the use of participatory planning and citizen involvement.

The second edition builds and expands upon the highly acclaimed first edition, with new chapters on urban design and urban, regional and intercity public transportation, as well as expanded chapters on automobile dependence and equity issues; automobile cities and the car culture; the history of sustainable and unsustainable transportation; the interrelatedness of technologies, infrastructure energy and functionalities; and public policy and public participation and exemplary places, people and programs around the globe. Among the many valuable additions are discussions of autonomous vehicles (AVs), electric vehicles (EVs), airport cities, urban fabrics, urban heat island effects and mobility as a service (MaaS).

socio-spatial settings in which there are substantial trust relationships among people and where they feel defended (safe) from internal risks. Our scheme suggests five categories of conditions that together create Communities of Trust: Shared place, shared daily-life practices, shared basic beliefs, and shared perceptions of community interests and risks. This scheme was examined in five communities in Gaza city. Data were collected first by informal talks with residents and local decision-makers and then by means of 973 personal interviews in residents' homes. Undoubtedly, the human conditions of the people of Gaza are among the worst in the world. Living conditions in the city have been difficult for the past century due to a number of factors, including: waves of incoming Palestinian refugees of the War of 1948, and decades of Israeli occupation. In spite of difficult housing conditions, poor services and the pressure of lasting internal risks, this study found livable communities and strong trust relationships among people of Gaza's communities. This article explains this by the high levels of agreement on basic beliefs, the shared daily-life practices, the strong shared perception towards external risks and a few common interests, which were found within each studied area. The last part of the paper is related to the issues of generalizing from the case of homogeneous urban community in Gaza to the frequently heterogeneous communities of Western cities. This study concludes that trust relationships are the corner-stone upon which communities are based anywhere in the world. Hence, in order to sustain communities, planners should support trust relationships among residents.

Many urban theorists consider open space as an important component of a healthy urban environment.

Suffering from land shortage and a dense environment, the urban development of Hong Kong has in the past 70 years met the changing demands of fluctuating economic activities and a rising population. Architecture on the island has been shaped by social demands, the economy and technology. The buildings have been forged by the government, clients, planners, architects, many contractors and end-users.

With such attention to its deep traditions and rapidmodernization, the Middle East emerges as a rich setting for the study of modern architecture. Modernism and the Middle East begins at the cusp of the twentieth century amid the decline of colonialism and the rise of independent nation-states in regions once ruled by theOttomans (r. 1290-1924) in present-day Turkey and North Africa, and the Qajars (r. 1779-1924) in Iran (see fig. I.1).2 Under the dynastic leadership of the Sultan, overseer of the holy sites of Mecca andMedina and the supreme ruler of the Sunni Islamic world, the relatively stable and unified Ottoman Empire had administeredmuch of today's Middle East. But this administrative unity and geographic cohesion was eroded greatly during the nineteenth century, and it dissolved completely in the twentieth.3 Beyond the actual loss of land, Ottoman rule was disrupted by major infrastructure developments, most notably the Suez Canal (1854-69), which brought French and, later, English capital and technology to Egypt.4 By the twilight of World War I, in 1918, Istanbul had itself come under Allied control, and the six-hundred-year-oldOttoman Empire came to an end, its former lands divided into areas administered by the French (Syria and Lebanon) and the British (Iraq and Palestine).5 Even as newnations emerged with at least nominal sovereignty from the Mandate period, the idea of a coherent, if not exactly cohesive, Middle East was reinforced. The Mandates carved new political entities, such as Palestine and Iraq, out of former Ottoman administrative zones, but it kept these nations from being fully independent, and left them wanting in terms of industrial development. At the same time, European occupation sparked nationalist movements in neighboring Turkey and Iran, resulting in the overthrow of puppet monarchies and the rise of charismatic military leaders,who threwoff centuries of imperial rule and modernized in the name of national progress. The advent of Mustafa Kemal in Turkey (1919) and Riza Khan in Iran (1921) brought new modes of judicial and educational reforms (often based on European models), in an effort to forge homogeneous, if fictive, native identities.6 The characterization of entire peoples by their positions along the trajectory of history and modernization was asmuch embraced by regional leaders as it was imposed by European power and ideology. Oil came to be written into this idea of a cohesive Middle East as much by its discovery there as by the increasing industrial thirst for sources of fuel. The image of Arab states unified by oceans of oil lying unseen beneath their soil emerged in the nineteenth centurywith the advent of a British-controlled Anglo-Persian oil company. It was extended as new fields were discovered, such as those in Iraq in the 1930s and those in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia by 1945. With the institution of the American's Marshall Plan (1948-52), the European economy was reconfigured according to American precepts, resulting in an emphasis on continued growth in productivity and an even greater dependence on oil. The Middle East thus moved to the center of foreign-policy strategies for a number of Western nations, becoming also a site of contentious ideological positioning between the Soviet Union and the United States, with both nations acting out their political differences through technical aid and development projects as well as cultural exports. Although some small Persian Gulf monarchies enjoyed considerable advantages over their oil-poor neighbors, toWesterners the regionmaintained its conceptual integrity as a site of superpower struggle and vast economic opportunity.7 The creation of the state of Israel, on May 14, 1948, also helped consolidate an idea of the Middle East, albeit in a way unanticipated by mostWestern politicians. Although Jewish immigration to the area in the first half of the twentieth century had profoundly accected the economic and demographic character of Mandate Palestine, the United Nations' 1947 plan to partition the area into Jewish and Arab states,whichwas rejected by the Arab League, formed in 1945, seemed only to reassert Western colonialism at the very moment it was breaking apart elsewhere. Within this context, theMiddle Eastmust be historically situated as a place defined both by European colonial interests and by the specific imperial configurations that had existed in the region. Just as the specter of essentialism hovers over the term \"Middle East,\" one may argue that it also haunts the idea of a homogeneous \"Europe\"; nonetheless, as Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued in another context, these terms highlight, rather than obfuscate, the problematic of domination and intellectual dependency that permeates any discussion of these two entities.8 The interdependency of Europe and the Middle East can be seen in the unfolding of an \"Oriental\" supplement to European identity: what was understood by nineteenth-century policymakers as the \"Eastern question\" had to do less with the inhabitants of these regions than with the raw currency of human labor and material wealth promised through imperialism. \u00a9 2008 by University of Washington Press.

The advent of Mustafa Kemal in Turkey (1919) and Riza Khan in Iran (1921) brought new modes of judicial and educational reforms (often based on European models), in an effort to forge homogeneous, if fictive, native identities.6 The characterization of entire peoples by their positions along the trajectory of history and modernization was asmuch embraced by regional leaders as it was imposed by European power and ideology. Oil came to be written into this idea of a cohesive Middle East as much by its discovery there as by the increasing industrial thirst for sources of fuel. The image of Arab states unified by oceans of oil lying unseen beneath their soil emerged in the nineteenth centurywith the advent of a British-controlled Anglo-Persian oil company. It was extended as new fields were discovered, such as those in Iraq in the 1930s and those in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia by 1945. With the institution of the American's Marshall Plan (1948-52), the European economy was reconfigured according to American precepts, resulting in an emphasis on continued growth in productivity and an even greater dependence on oil. The Middle East thus moved to the center of foreign-policy strategies for a number of Western nations, becoming also a site of contentious ideological positioning between the Soviet Union and the United States, with both nations acting out their political differences through technical aid and development projects as well as cultural exports. Although some small Persian Gulf monarchies enjoyed considerable advantages over their oil-poor neighbors, toWesterners the regionmaintained its conceptual integrity as a site of superpower struggle and vast economic opportunity.7 The creation of the state of Israel, on May 14, 1948, also helped consolidate an idea of the Middle East, albeit in a way unanticipated by mostWestern politicians. Although Jewish immigration to the area in the first half of the twentieth century had profoundly accected the economic and demographic character of Mandate Palestine, the United Nations' 1947 plan to partition the area into Jewish and Arab states,whichwas rejected by the Arab League, formed in 1945, seemed only to reassert Western colonialism at the very moment it was breaking apart elsewhere. Within this context, theMiddle Eastmust be historically situated as a place defined both by European colonial interests and by the specific imperial configurations that had existed in the region. Just as the specter of essentialism hovers over the term \"Middle East,\" one may argue that it also haunts the idea of a homogeneous \"Europe\"; nonetheless, as Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued in another context, these terms highlight, rather than obfuscate, the problematic of domination and intellectual dependency that permeates any discussion of these two entities.8 The interdependency of Europe and the Middle East can be seen in the unfolding of an \"Oriental\" supplement to European identity: what was understood by nineteenth-century policymakers as the \"Eastern question\" had to do less with the inhabitants of these regions than with the raw currency of human labor and material wealth promised through imperialism. \u00a9 2008 by University of Washington Press.

minimizing waste. However, Lean philosophy has not been well understood yet in the construction industry for the fact that the complexity and dynamic nature of construction projects bring up uncertainties that may be hardly handled by construction practitioners. Moreover, project-based nature of construction business makes Lean implementation even more challenging for construction people. Even though Lean efforts in construction have recently increased, there are problems with the implementation processes. It is undeniable that successful Lean implementation strongly affects project performance. Therefore, it is essential to reveal enablers and barriers in Lean implementation so that the construction industry practitioners might conduct projects more effectively and satisfy project requirements (i.e. schedule, budget, safety). This study aims to provide a set of core enablers and barriers of Lean implementation in construction projects and guide construction professionals to better satisfy project requirements. Within this context, the study proposes seven major enabler and barrier groups, namely the financial, managerial, technical, workforce, culture, government, and communication and twenty-seven components for each group. Moreover, a survey was designed and administered to Lean practitioners to rank the enablers and barriers based on importance level. Clear understanding of technical requirements in Lean practices was ranked as the most important enabler of Lean implementation whereas lack of top management support was ranked as the most important barrier in the Lean implementation. However, the average rankings were not found to be diverging indicating that selected components of enabler and barrier groups are properly chosen. The study is expected to lead Lean practitioners with creating value to customers while preventing them from experiencing waste. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Bayhan H.G., Demirkesen S., Jayamanne E.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/2\/022002","Text":"Enablers and Barriers of Lean Implementation in Construction Projects.

income in creative knowledge work, a highly flexible labour market segment that demands a geographically mobile workforce. Creative knowledge work is based on an understanding of language, culture and symbolic meanings. This can best be obtained through local and national embeddedness.

What new forms of place attachment does this bring about? This book introduces a showcase of 25 multilocal creative knowledge workers, who live in different countries at the same time. It investigates how continuous mobility becomes part of their lifeworld, and how it changes their feelings of belonging and practices of place attachment. Applying an innovative methodological mix of social phenomenology, hermeneutics and mental mapping, this book takes a detailed look at biographies and the role of places in mobile lifeworlds. Plug&Play Places brings forth the idea that places have to be understood as individual items, which are configured and then plugged into the 'system' of the own lifeworld. They can be 'played' without great effort once an individual needs to make use of them. This new type of place attachment is a form of subjective standardization of place, which complements the well-known models of objective standardization of places. Plug&Play Places is relevant for scientists who deal with mobility and its impact on individual lifeworlds, with transnational multilocality and with flexibilized labour markets. Furthermore, the book provides a detailed qualitative perspective which can enrich the explanations of quantitative research in the same field. It is an interesting reading also for practitioners engaged in urban planning, housing and real estate development.

The Village of Oak Park is known for its architectural heritage and outspoken community. Within its 4.5 square miles live a diverse population of approximately 52,000 people from different cultures, races, ethnicities, professions, lifestyles, religions, ages, and incomes where a majority of the population have some advanced education and over 80% of the households report home Internet use.

These questions are examined during a year-long case study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in cooperation with the Village of Oak Park (VOP). Specifically, the investigators examined how information is gathered and used in the planning process and how the introduction of Information Technology (IT) tools influenced public participation and introduced many citizens to e-government through the planning process. The use of these tools is compared to the traditional planning process. Data from the project is presented to demonstrate a different kind of role librarians play in the research process.

concepts of learning and diffusion within the context of urban development and sustainable active mobility. A model is proposed, which treats learning as a diffusion process in a dynamic way, so that key strategies and their effects are investigated over time. Specifically, the question being examined is how learning and information technology strategies can change the mindset of people to be more physically active in their mobility around a city. This is carried out by developing a system dynamics (SD) computer simulation model, where learning strategies that promote walking can be tested prior to implementation. Design\/methodology\/approach: Based on the specific key stages of knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation, the proposed SD model incorporates individual citizen and group level learning and diffusion processes in a unified integrated approach. The SD model gives a clear picture on how learning and changing mindsets occur in the context of a city, whereby we can explore the main drivers to learn new sustainability related habits. A case study is used to contextualize and demostrate the active mobility issue, in order to develop practical scenarios for promoting a walking mindset. This is done in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model and show its practicality. Through the model we investigate the relationships among variables such as awareness, contact, communication and adoption and evaluate their impact on city policies to promote a walking mindset. Findings: The developed SD model exhibits important dimensions, such as social learning, motivation to change behaviour and an analysis of the effects of plausible strategies for promoting sustainable active mobility. The authors have proven that through simulation experimentation, we can significantly accelerate the shaping and diffusion of a walking mindset, by influencing individual and community learning via the introduction of Information and Communication Technology in conjunction with an awareness campaign strategy. Research limitations\/implications: The diagrammatic representation and the quantification of the factors that contribute to active mobility give rise to better understanding of how policy makers could promote a walking culture in a city. The implications are that the proposed SD model could be used by city planning authorities as a framework for shaping mindsets towards active and sustainable mobility. Originality\/value: This paper contributes to the further understanding of learning, diffusion of new ideas and strategic planning within the city context. Through the proposed SD model, a number of strategies are formulated and tested using scenario planning, sensitivity analysis and optimization, in order to develop a walking mindset and an urban culture of sustainability. \u00a9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Active mobility; Diffusion theory; Learning capability; Organizational learning; System dynamics; Urban development","Authors":"Papageorgiou G., Demetriou G.","DOI":"10.1108\/SASBE-02-2019-0020","Text":"Investigating learning and diffusion strategies for sustainable mobility.

distribution of 149 urban conflicts occurring between 1989 and 2000 in Quebec City, Canada.

The results of statistical analyses by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Mann-Whitney test show, regardless of the dimension considered, to what extent certain areas are characterized by frequency, duration, or intensity of the conflict activity. Specifically, the results suggest that the degree of involvement of local people in a conflict varies very much depending on the nature of the social composition. Other findings show a relationship between areas with a high propensity to associate and to voice and a conflict activity that is more intense, more frequent, but not necessarily longer. These forms of social practices are thus testimony to the existence of know-how, i.e., a culture of conflict activity oriented towards efficiency. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Author Keywords":"Spatial analysis; Statistical analysis; Territorial decision-making processes; Urban conflicts; Urban environments","Authors":"Pelletier M., Joerin F., Kestens Y., Villeneuve P.Y.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12061-010-9050-8","Text":"Conflict Activity in the Neighborhoods of Quebec City (Canada), 1989-2000.

These examples show how metadesign and cultures of participation are design approaches that allow researchers and practitioners to extend boundaries by allowing all stakeholders to have more control over their artifacts and by providing opportunities to encourage and to support contributions by many people in personally meaningful activ ities. \u00a9 2010 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Boundaries; Control; Cultures of participation; Distances; Meta-design; Motivation; Socio-technical environments; Systemic problems","Authors":"Fischer G.","DOI":"10.1145\/1868914.1868937","Text":"Extending boundaries with meta-design and cultures of participation.

It was found that these settlements had twofold characteristics; externally, they directed the trajectory of growth and expansion of the city owing to their strategic location in the periphery around the old core, and internally within, they contributed to reshaping of urban form and vernacular architecture as the affected people reconstructed their houses and everyday lives.

walking activity and recent efforts at augmenting walkability conditions in the cities of Macau, Lisbon and Las Vegas. Design\/methodology\/approach: The methodology consisted mostly of in-loco observations, pedestrian counts and extensive reviews of the literature, city plans and regulations. Findings: The findings include the need to properly design, maintain and retrofit pedestrian facilities, while reducing safety conflicts among street users as well as the establishment and the nurturing of a culture of walking. Research limitations\/implications: A fivefold international walkability research agenda with implications for other cities around the world is established: the value and the need for comparative studies and best practices; the need for urban design interventions; the cultivation of attractiveness and aesthetics; the implementation of safety, construction and maintenance criteria; and responsible funding programs. Practical implications: This paper has twofold implications for stakeholders with direct responsibilities in the design, planning, building and maintenance of streets and public spaces, and for those who simply use those places at their own discretion. Social implications: A succinct set of recommendations include the need to augment endogeneity, the need to make cities for people and not for automobiles and commitment to resolving pedestrian safety concerns. Originality\/value: This paper discusses the factors affecting street vibrancy from both a stakeholder\u2019s and a user\u2019s perspective.

advances in the wood construction field have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall buildings structures and other constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in CO2eq emissions of the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials like concrete or steel, with wood and biomass-based materials. Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO2eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W\/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Hidalgo-Cordero J.F., Garc\u00eda-Navarro J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/245\/2\/022068","Text":"Review on the Traditional Uses and Potential of Totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) as Construction Material.

among architectural and urban designs, sensors, actuators and crowds of people with their devices. In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement. In order to allow for a more effective participation of humans in the simulation, our approach does not use central coordinators or coordination protocol, but rather each agent takes its own decision so to make more realistic interactions. A software architecture and initial experimental results are presented and discussed. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Robol M., Giorgini P., Busetta P.","DOI":"10.1109\/ISC2.2016.7580808","Text":"Applying social norms to high-fidelity pedestrian and traffic simulations.

construction of affordable housing in Manitoba's inner-city areas. Much of this housing is targeted to communities that are predominantly Aboriginal. Little consultation has occurred about the underlying cultural assumptions of the design of these homes. This is in spite of the fact that the layout of a home may significantly direct the life ways of a family or affect their relationships to relatives or neighbours. Lack of consultation has proved problematic in some Indigenous communities, whereas in those few cases where consultation has occurred, the emerging designs have been significantly different from conventional designs. This article describes a four-year process of consultation on cultural concepts in the design of buildings intended for Aboriginal families in urban communities in Manitoba. Participatory design activities drew out numerous themes that, if incorporated into buildings, might help Indigenous families retain or recover their cultural values and lifeways. A number of these Indigenous themes have been incorporated in buildings that have already been constructed. The themes relate not just to the decorative features of the buildings but to conceptual assumptions underlying their design.

and with different aspirations can meet and interact with each other. Public places being the urban stages where the social interactions happen are considered important parts of cities (Thompson, 2002; Varna, 2009). They can contribute to enhance the quality of life within cities, or contrarily increase isolation and social exclusion (Lo et al., 2003). As a consequence of globalization and the development of global cities, the level of international migration has been growing in the last decades creating a plurality of different cultures in global cities and inspiring in such cities a multicultural nature (O'Byrne, 1997; Short and Kim, 1999; Hawkins, 2006). This created new challenges in urban planning or the management of the coexistence of different people that are having different characteristics that shape their unique identity and needs in the shared spaces (Sandercock, 2004). Ideally, in order to invite a diversity of users, urban outdoor places should provide significant functional and physical qualities, and accessibility to them, which induce the fulfillment of physiological, psychological and social needs (Carr et al., 1992; Jacobs, 1993; Sandholz, 2007). Users' state of comfort as stated by researchers gives a good indication for how successful is the public outdoor places (Rosheidat et al., 2008; Kwong et al., 2009; Aljawabra and Nikolopoulou, 2010). In order to create a successful open space usable by all members of a community, urban designers need to satisfy their comfort needs in its wider meaning according to a variety of different ages, genders and cultural backgrounds (Knez and Thorsson, 2006; Thorsson et al., 2007).

adaptation of most people and societies in Nigeria. Specifically, within the Yoruba ethnic group of south-western part of Nigeria. To them, the house represents a status symbol, which every member of a particular family identifies with. The pattern and form of such dwelling have played vital role in shaping and influencing the lifestyle of the people. The house to them is a place for moral and social formation as well as for physical and psychology reformation. Unfortunately, the effect and infusion of western cultural contact through civilization, technological advancement and the unfolding world order of globalization on majority of African societies and people have created loss of originality in housing forms and patterns as well as loss of cultural values of the people. This paper, which emanated from a previous resear ch by the Authors, intends to evaluate the significance of house- forms on housing quality as well as on the lifestyle of the Nigeria people. Osogbo, a traditional as well as an urbanized township was used as case study. (The findings of the research are representative of the Housing situation in most Nigerian societies). The study, which identified three (3) zones of res idential and urban development revealed a significant relationship between House-form and Housing quality within the residential districts of Osogbo. It also affirmed the predominance of the Yoruba ethnic origin over other ethnic origins in Osogbo. The paper submitted that any housing planning and de velopment that ignores the relevant socio-cultural forms and patterns would invariably lack originality and relevance to the target population.

of this paper is to review, analyze and synthesize different pieces from literature to explore, define and describe the concept of social capital and its relationships with urban neighborhood design concepts. Additionally, to define the indicators and principles that can enhance social capital within urban design context. Moreover, to suggest theoretical urban neighborhood design concept that can adopt the changing discourse of social capital. Design\/methodology\/approach: This research used the theoretical, analytical and descriptive approach-driven case study method. In all, 29 papers were analyzed to conclude the indicators that can measure social capital within the urban neighborhood design context and to conclude the required neighborhood design features and principles that influence social capital. Additionally, two new urban neighborhoods design concepts, cohousing and hybrid concepts that adopt new forms of social interaction, were studied, analyzed and then synthesized to suggest new neighborhood design concept, which is a heterotopia concept. Findings: Heterotopia neighborhood concept aims to create real, different and heterogeneous functional spaces with different layers of meanings for people from different cultures in one place. Different visible enclosures are merged into spaces of otherness while the diversity gives a sense of entering another alternative place. The heterotopias neighborhood design principles aim to create a wide variety of forms, shapes and elements [different new spaces for different ritual activities to reflect the otherness self-reflection (homogeneous and scattered spaces)] and create linkage, hierarchy, contrast and mingling between spaces and places; well-defined functional effective spaces; different fantasy and leisure spaces; high standard quality of life and otherness space; flux in social realm and fluidity of spaces; mixed use and joint experience; and innovated technologies spaces to offer strange new temporalities. Research limitations\/implications: This research recommended that different community stakeholders should participate in planning process, neighborhood urban design and decision-making process about public spaces to strengthen the community ties and achieve a heterotopia concept. Architect, urban designers and planners should adopt bottom-up design approach when designing neighborhood. Additionally, to avoid poor social capital research studies, the new researchers, practitioners and journal reviewers approaching social capital for the first time must read widely to gain an understanding of the concept from different perspectives and narrow their scope to their particular area of interest. Practical implications: This research highlights the needs for empirical studies to examine the relationships\/interrelationships between all neighborhood design principles and social capital. This might increase the knowledge on how we can design and increase the quality of neighborhood to foster social capital, which might offer interesting insights into how neighborhood urban design principles are combined to foster social capital within neighborhood context. Originality\/value: Neighborhood-based research encourages new suggesting concepts in designing every single place in the residential neighborhood in a way that can adapt the new forms of social interaction. This research scanned the current concepts of neighborhood design that concerned successfully with the changing forms of social relationships to conclude some design features and principles for neighborhood design to ensure and promote social public health and well-being. This research offers a unique perspective for better understanding the relationships between the neighborhood urban design as a spatial dimension and social capital. This research aims to enrich the socio-spatial knowledge and build a resilient urban community by suggesting theoretical urban neighborhood design concept, which is the heterotopia concept, and providing the urban designers and architects with a valuable thinking tool to design spaces. \u00a9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Cohousing; Heterotopia spaces; Hybrid spaces; Neighborhood design; Social capital","Authors":"Alhusban S.A., Alhusban A.A., AlBetawi Y.N.","DOI":"10.1108\/JEC-09-2018-0064","Text":"Suggesting theoretical urban neighborhood design concept by adopting the changing discourse of social capital.

geo-architecture","Abstract":"This book approaches the concept of geo-architecture by analyzing the symbolic characters of architectures. It proves that the relationship between architecture and geography is not merely an embodiment of physical and functional demands but rather a formal expression of the materialization of culture. After analyzing the vast number of villages, groups of buildings and individual buildings the forms of which closely resemble the forms of the Bagua (symbol of the Eight Trigrams), Taichi, animals and plants, this book finds that this kind of symbolism creatively places living and working places within the natural geographic environment and, by seeking a relationship between architecture and its surrounding environment, comes to express people\u2019s hopes and dreams, evolving slowly to take on certain cultural connotations. This book is the fourth of a 4-volume book series. The series develops the innovative concept of \u201cgeo-architecture\u201d by exploring the myriad influences of natural, human and historical factors upon architecture. These influences are considered in three categories, namely, interaction between architecture and nature, interaction between architecture and its human users and change in architecture over time--each category serves as a lens. Augmenting these lenses is the Time-Person-Place concept applied different geographic. The analysis ultimately focuses on two aspects: geographic influence on architecture and architectural response to geography. The over 1000 pictures of case architectures enriches the study with stunning and unique visual angles. \"This unprecedented work will be a unique and valuable contribution to the literature. Integrating as it does the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, and geography, Wang Fang\u2019s voice is original, compelling, and will be much appreciated by English-speaking readers (and inside China, too, I can only imagine.)\"Stephen M Ervin Assistant Dean Graduate School of Design, Harvard University July 2nd, 2013 \"One reason for why there would be interest is because her research would fill some significant gaps in the literature.What is novel about Dr. Wang\u2019s series is that she further extends this intellectual project of looking at Chinese architecture through Chinese eyes, by taking it one provocative step further.\"Annette M.

Accessible and open to everyone, they are designed for a variety of uses where people can participate in public life. They also contribute to the collective identity of the community as they represent the culture and values of its users. In recent decades, the different ways in which public spaces are used have been the subject of studies from different disciplines including but not limited to anthropology, geography, sociology, architecture, and urban planning. It has been argued that the way in which urban life is lived and experienced changes according to demographics of its users such as age, sex, and social class.In this study, the use of public spaces based on gender differences is analyzed using space syntax methodology. The context of the study is the city center of a small Anatolian town, Balikesir, which is located in western Turkey. The methodology of the study includes a visibility analysis of the historic city center and pedestrian movement observations on the selected locations within this center. The results indicate that male users dominate the city center at all times while the density of women users is much lower, and is even lower than that of teenagers. A major contribution of this study is the finding that there is a discrepancy between the most integrated streets in terms of visibility and the most densely used ones. Given that the users of this small Anatolian town are mostly its residents, this finding suggests that for route-choice decisions,pedestrians utilize prior knowledge and experience of the city center more than the visual information provided to them via the geometry of the space. \u00a9 2014, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

conducting transactions have reduced the role of propinquity across a large spectrum of civic activities. Simultaneously, however, technological advances affecting many realms of commerce and culture have increased the necessity and desire for face-to-face contact. Ceding substantial portions of our time to the virtual realm has, curiously, enhanced the importance of local-scale, physical world interactions. In this paper we focus on an elemental concept in urban development and planning: population density. Given that individual lives are now carried out within both physical and virtual spaces, we detail the advantages for land use policy of deploying density measures that are \u201cpeople-based\u201d rather than areal based. Such metrics provide a rich perspective reflecting planning-relevant geographies of spatial interaction. Rather than restricting density calculation to pre-specified areal units, such as municipalities, neighborhoods, census tracts, city blocks, or land parcels, we propose the deployment of \u201cperceived\u201d density surfaces that yield point-specific values for a set of bespoke values operationalizing critically relevant time-distance thresholds. We suggest embedding walking density, cycling density, and auto-travel density into the formulation and evaluation of land use decisions. In addition to being useful for many practical purposes, threshold-based perceived density provides an interesting conceptual framework for examining how individuals experience and interact within a spectrum of surrounding, microcosmic world spaces. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Activity patterns; Land use policy; Physical versus virtual spaces; Population density; Time geography","Authors":"Plane D.A., Mu W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2020.104462","Text":"A people-based density perspective on physical\/virtual world spaces in the microcosmic city.

critical to urban liveability and resilience. This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Ecosystem management; Municipal government; Nature-based solutions; Q-method; Urban forest governance; Urban planning","Authors":"Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez C., Kendal D., Threlfall C.G., Hochuli D.F., Davern M., Fuller R.A., van der Ree R., Livesley S.J.","DOI":"10.3390\/f11090963","Text":"How urban forest managers evaluate management and governance challenges in their decision-making.

the current world most of the population is concentrated in urban areas, where people receive their education, work and leisure activities.

design. It is usually evaluated based on how loud the urban environment is. However, this approach does not consider people's perception of the urban acoustic environment. Therefore, a different method has been developed based on the perception of the acoustic environment using the concept of soundscape. Soundscape is defined as the acoustic environment perceived by people who are part of the environment. This approach considers the relationship between the sound source, the environment, and the people. The analysis of soundscape considers many aspects such as cultural aspects, people's expectations, people's experience of space, and social aspects. Soundscape affects many aspects of human life such as culture, health, and the quality of life. Urban soundscape management and planning must be integrated with the other aspect of urban design, both in the design and the improvement stages. The soundscape concept seeks to make the acoustic environment as pleasant as possible in a space with or without uncomfortable sound sources. Soundscape planning includes the design of physical features to achieve a positive perceptual outcome. It is vital to gather data regarding the relationship between humans and the components of a soundscape, e.g., sound sources, features of the physical environment, the functions of a space, and the expectation of the sound source. The data can be measured and gathered using several soundscape evaluation methods. Soundscape evaluation is usually conducted using in-situ surveys and laboratory experiments using a multi-speaker system. Although these methods have been validated and are widely used in soundscape analysis, there are some limitations in the application. The in-situ survey needs to be done at one time with many people at the same time because it is hard to replicate the acoustic environment. Conversely, the laboratory experiment does not have a problem with the repetition of the experiment. This method requires a room with a multi-speaker reproduction system. This project used a different method to analyse soundscape developed using headphones via the internet. The internet system for data gathering has been established; a website has enabled to reproduce high-quality audio and it has a system to design online questionnaires. Furthermore, the development of a virtual reality system allows the reproduction of virtual audio-visual stimulus on a website. Although the website has an established system to gather the required data, the problem is the validation of the reproduction system for soundscape analysis, which needs to be done with consideration of several factors: the suitable recording system, the effect of headphone variation, the calibration of the system, and the perception result from internet-based acoustic environment reproduction. This study aims to develop and validate a web-based urban soundscape evaluation method. By using this method, the experiment can be repeated easily and data can be gathered from many respondents. Furthermore, the simplicity of the system allows for the application by the stakeholders in urban design. The data gathered from this system is important for the design of an urban area with consideration of the acoustic aspects. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sudarsono A.S., Sarwono J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1755-1315\/158\/1\/012052","Text":"The Development of a Web-Based Urban Soundscape Evaluation System.

assumption that modernity has been disastrous environmentally. Might it be possible to see Mumford, especially in his writings of the 1930s, as an early exemplar of green urbanism? Within environmental history, Mumford has been treated mostly as a regionalist - sometimes even as an opponent of the city. This essay argues that in fact his path toward ecological \"balance\" led directly through the city, not out of it. Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic \"renewal\" but also as a landscape full of what he called \"remnants\" and \"persistents\"; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. \u00a9 2016 The Author.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sachs A.","DOI":"10.1093\/envhis\/emw034","Text":"Lewis Mumford's Urbanism and the Problem of Environmental Modernity.

It is imperative to harness the latent potential of existing settlements for an inclusive smart urban development. The study aims to assess the socio-cultural attributes of an Indian historic urban landscape with a thriving residential culture.

Fuzzy arithmetic and weighted averaging operators are applied for the hierarchical evaluation of indicators and variables. A robust algorithm is used for the dimension reduction of a fuzzy coded dataset while dealing with subjective responses. The aggregated fuzzy scores show an overall better performance of traditional communities with respect to their socio-cultural attributes, such as a sense of safety and collective efficacy.

of the beholder means that beauty is largely subjective so varies from person to person. While the subjectivity view is commonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of subsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion of beauty\u2014structural beauty\u2014among people and even different peoples, regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a physical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based on the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To verify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight pairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies that goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an opinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision, architecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and psychology. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

footprint of daily travel for an individual household is based on the types of vehicles that the household owns, their fuel efficiency, and the number of miles traveled (Federal Highway Administration, 2009). Therefore, the types and usage of vehicles a household owns are informational to overall sustainable planning. This study develops a multinomial logit model for vehicle type choice and a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model for vehicle use for Ohio households using the most recent Household Travel Survey (HTS) collected in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The developed vehicle choice model identifies the effects of the built environment characteristics on vehicle type based on vehicle size, controlling for socio-economic attributes. People residing in neighborhoods characterized with higher densities in population, employment, and intersection and with fewer single detached housing are more likely to own smaller vehicles as compared to the ones living in suburban areas. A good transit accessibility would decrease the probability of owning pickup trucks. The SAR model reveals how the vehicle a household owns is used is still slightly positively associated with his\/her neighbour\u2019s vehicle use after controlling for the effects of the built environment and socio-economics. The models will enable decision makers to estimate potential changes in vehicle fleet composition under changing built environment scenarios and neighborhood culture in using private vehicles.

relevant tasks is a justified calculation of the electrical capacity of residential buildings and public facilities. Studies conducted by the 'Roselectromontazh' Association have shown a significant difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity, which is further confirmed by the reports of electric grid companies. In some cases, there is a 3-fold difference. This occurs due to the emergence of a sustainable culture of electricity consumption and the use of highly energy-efficient devices. In 2019, the results of the research work were taken into account in the regional urban planning standards of the Republic of Tatarstan. On average, the normative values have been reduced by 2 times. This enabled a significant reduction in the difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity. From 2020 onwards, leading construction companies in the Republic of Tatarstan are applying up-to-date values to decrease utility services' construction costs. For power grid companies the savings consist of reduction of electrical energy losses and 'locked electrical capacity' and the elimination of inefficient investments. It is important to note that specific values of electrical load were calculated taking into account summer and winter peaks in order to exclude the emergencies. However, it was impossible to predict a time when people would need to stay self-isolated at home to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019). Corresponding diagrams relative to 2019 were constructed to determine the impact of the electricity consumption of residential buildings during lockdown. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Calculated electrical load; COVID-19; Daily power profiles; Electrical power supply system; Locked electrical capacity; Standby electric power","Authors":"Soluyanov Y., Fedotov A., Akhmetshin A., Khalturin V.","DOI":"10.1109\/USEC50097.2020.9281179","Text":"Monitoring of electrical consumption, including self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

University","Abstract":"Students as a special social group can be considered as a guide of interaction between the partner countries of Russia and China as representatives of different cultures and different mentalities. Interaction between Russian and Chinese universities in the scientific and educational sphere has specific features and reflects the general mechanisms of functioning in social and cultural environment. The socio-cultural context of such interaction is the life activity of megalopolis, regional features and it is related to the socio-cultural traditions of people relationship. The general purpose of the study was to identify changes in interaction between Russian and Chinese students studying in a Russian University. The study conducted in Russian and Chinese Universities. The research methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The primary data was collected using questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Three hundred and ninety respondents - Russian students and five hundred respondents - Chinese students, were questioned on the basis of quota sampling. Depths interviews were conducted with 20 experts. The study has revealed some actual issues and tendencies of social interaction in the educational sphere. It has a temporal character and it is developed in a single educational environment of universities-partners of Russia and China. The study has identified the structure of social interaction, consisting of five levels: 1. At the level of connectivity, social relations between social and ethnic groups (in this case, Russian and Chinese students) are established on the basis of their values. 2. At the level of translation, understanding of the values of another (different) culture through the interpretation of cultural codes (cultural signs) takes place. 3. At the level of transcendence, transition from one's cultural system to another, the development of positive experience and knowledge of another cultural system take place. 4. At the level of adaptation, an interiorization, application in behaviour and activity of values of other cultural system take place. 5. At the level of inter cultural dialogue, an organization of effective and fruitful cooperation between social and ethnic groups and their representatives based on an understanding of the universal values takes place. The five levels of social interaction identified by researches in the joint educational environment of Russian and Chinese universities allow not only to find out the content components of the structure of social and cultural interaction, but also to consider its dynamics and development. Our research has identified a set of factors that affect the functioning of the interaction between Russian and Chinese students structure: geopolitical situation, cost and quality of education, adaptation of training courses for foreigners, comfort of the educational environment of University, the complexity of learning of the host country language, the prestige of education. This model of interaction between social and ethnic groups of Russian and Chinese students being representatives of partner universities is confirmed by the real practice of scientific and educational cooperation between Russian and Chinese universities. Joint forms of University work have been successfully tested and activities that have become events of inter cultural dialogue have been organized. \u00a9 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

sensitive issue of interrelationships between national parks situated near or within urban areas and their urban environment. It engages with both urban and conservation issues and and compares four national parks located in four large cities in the global South: Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Mumbai, and Nairobi. Though primarily undertaken as academic research, the project has intensively collaborated with the institutions in charge of these parks. The comparative structure of this volume is also original and unique: each of the chapters incorporates insight from all four sites as far as possible.The term \"naturbanity\" expresses the necessity for cities endowed with a national park to integrate it into their functioning. Conversely, such parks must take into account their location in an urban environment, both as a source of heavy pressures on nature and as a nexus of incentives to support their conservation. The principle of non-exclusivity, that is, neither the city nor the park has a right nor even the possibility to negate the other's presence, summarizes the main argument of this book. Naturbanity thus blurs the old \"modern\" dichotomy of nature\/culture: animals and human beings can often jump the physical and ideological walls separating many parks from the adjacent city. The 13 chapters and substantive introduction of this volume discuss various aspects of naturbanity: the histories of park creation; interaction between people and parks; urban governance and parks; urban conservation models; wildlife management; environmental education; and so on. This is a must-read for students and researchers interested in social ecology, social geography, conservation, urban planning and ecological policy. \u00a9 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

vital local high-street places with their walking spaces and economies founded in interfaces between neighbourhood and city (between walking and public transport\/bicycle movement infrastructures).

High-streets and mobility environments are both central places and our way of describing them suggests a new definition of central places as interfaces between normative (but also technically-infrastructually supported) political spaces (neighbourhood, city and region). It also clarifies the role of scale in place theory and we will deal with this in a following paper. Here we introduce ideas of 'modality places' and 'modality environments'.

Modality environments are understood in terms of transportation networks and the social and functional factors (like sustainability and urbanity) they produce. Modality environments are seen as lived environments built around movement infrastructure grids that distribute everyday urban functions. Ideally modality environments would be simple clear grids that distribute all or close to all the functions of everyday life so that a walking grid or a bicycle grid that gets adults to work, their children to school and includes shopping and recreation would be walking or bicycle modality environments.

the past four decades, infrastructural and economic development in Chinese cities has outpaced its cultural development. As the proportion of people living in cities in China quintupled from 1950 to 2014, from 11% to 54% according to a 2009 report by McKinsey, while at the same time various challenges have paved the way to limit cultural prosperity and quality of life in cities. Cities currently face number of problems: Vehicle-oriented streets are not friendly to pedestrians; public spaces are designed without users in mind [1]; communities are isolated from one another [2]; and finally creative industries are lagging behind other industries according to a 2014 Forbes report. It seems that China's urban development states a condition of \"survivability\" rather than \"livability\". What is understood from the notion of livability within a city today is to be able to sustain quality of life through holistic planning strategies rather than purely economic ones. Such cities create robust natural environments as well as built environments, social equity as well as social stability. And as a result both a more reliable creative prosperity and economic prosperity have been maintained. This paper will seek to establish a 3-pillar approach to social inclusion and will examine each of these through issues related with migrants in China facing today. It seems that there is a great potential in using mobile and web-based technologies to generate rapid and sustainable solutions for migrants. There is also an enormous potential to develop feedback mechanisms for these solutions that can become part of the 'culture' of living in big cities in China. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"hukou; livability; migrants; mobile technology; social inclusion","Authors":"Gorgul E., Luo L., Rivera C.R., Jesseph B.-A.H., Hamel J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.proeng.2017.07.105","Text":"Fostering a More 'Cultured' City through Inclusion: Metrics for Sense of Belonging for Migrants in Chinese Urban Areas.

The Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC), under his directorship, was in the midst of one of the longest winning streaks any urban planning body had or has ever achieved. With Penn Center, Society Hill, Independence Mall, the neighborhoods of Eastwick and the Far Northeast each underway or finished, Bacon and his team of young planners were totally in their stride in 1959, working to think, dig, and build the city out of its rut. The Market East transportation center, a pedestrian-friendly Chestnut Street, and a tourist-friendly Delaware waterfront were all on Bacon's drawing board, too. These were the varied pieces, described in turn by each of the authors in this volume, of a full urban-renewal portfolio advanced consistently over more than two decades by the PCPC. Postwar federal legislation enabled city officials for the first time to broadly exercise eminent domain powers, moving masses of residents and bulldozing whole sections of the city, planning and building anew.4 Ed Bacon's PCPC was certainly of its time in this respect and forceful in its place, stirring up both wonder and backlash. The old industrial city, the city that had lain fallow through the Depression and World War II, was awakening slowly to the possibility of highrises and integrated transportation hubs, and at the same time rediscovering its walkable character and the vernacular beauties of its historic neighborhoods. Bacon's idea was to liberate William Penn's grid from over a century of industrial-age clutter and to make the city simultaneously auto-, pedestrian-, and investment-friendly. Bacon understood the power of display and salesmanship as keys to making his idea of the next Philadelphia into something tangible. In this spirit, his \"2009\" essay arrived on newsstands in 1959. Could new high-rises and a suburban-style shopping center downtown reverse massive job losses and a suburban exodus? Whether the PCPC's projects were comprehensive enough remained an open question in 1959. In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The \"2009\" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's \"2009\" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the \"master planner\" and by extension New Deal\/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009.\".

In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The \"2009\" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's \"2009\" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the \"master planner\" and by extension New Deal\/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009.\".

The Main Building was the largest in the world at the time-over a third of a mile long.

Foreigners flocked to Philadelphia-inaugurating mass tourism to the United States-to see American industrial innovations and dozens of foreign exhibits from Britain, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Japan, China, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and \"two large Arab tents.\" This influx of visitors and national cultures also opened Philadelphia andthe United States to a world of new influences; the Japanese exhibit in particular stirred an Oriental design fashion in the United States.3 Beyond the pomp, the fanfare, the hotel receipts, and the visitors, the Centennial also helped restructure the city's politics. The event both cemented networks of alliances among previously divided elites and marked the ascendance of a Republican hegemony in local political culture that would be virtually unchallenged for the next sixty years. The Republican regime that coalesced in the 1870s combined several elements: party bossism centered in control of several city agencies, an electoral machine that came to trade votes for public construction contracts, business support based in ideological solidarity (support for protectionist legislation), and reliance on rail- And port-related industries as the engine of the city's economy. In Philadelphia's case, the irony is that those Republicans who did the most to make the Centennial happen-large, reformist civic organizations like the Union League that played crucial roles in event planning and in promoting commitment to the Republican Party-did not necessarily enjoy the political fruits of their labors. Over time, the elite's cultural and ideological commitment to Republicanism became a straitjacket, and they lost control of the polity they had helped build. More broadly, I use the example of the Centennial to examine the role that cultural projects play in urban governance. These projects, and the planning efforts that produce them, contribute to the emergence and consolidation of governing regimes out of situations of extreme political discord and fragmentation. They connect processes of elite network formation (social capital) and ideological consolidation.

Urban indicators and performance measurement are the answers, aiming to improve local performance on key trends and contribute to solving global problems. Better information, according to the rational model that predominates in urban policy, is the surest path to improve action. The World Urban Forum (WUF) III, meeting in Vancouver in June 2006, considers dimensions, challenges, and practices in the use of urban indicators in the Vancouver region. Patrick Geddes, writing in the early days of the town and regional planning movement, insisted upon the value of what he called a synoptic view, \"a seeing of the city and this as a whole; like Athens from its Acropolis\" (Geddes, 1949, p. 6). Working from a synoptic view did not simply mean gazing down on the city from atop a hill. Geddes strove to help people express \"simultaneity\" of their own being. Understanding that people living in a given region have a multitude of different perspectives, simultaneity of being meant \"one-ness with the social ideals, the scientific developments and the physical conditions of [their] own time and place\" (Geddes, 1949, p. x). He believed a region could be created and planned to aid people in accomplishing all these things. As one of the forefathers of town and regional planning, Geddes himself was a maker of \"great maps and diagrams and charts\" (Geddes, 1949, p. xiii)-but his most lasting contribution to the profession and practice of planning was his notion of the Civic Exhibition. Geddes was less concerned about expert training to make great plans and planners than he was \"concerned that the ordinary citizen should have a vision and a comprehension of the possibilities of his own city\" (Geddes, 1949, p. xi). A periodic Civic Exhibition, during which citizens could gather in a festive atmosphere to peruse plans, gaze at large maps and models, discuss and interpret these publicly, was one part of Geddes's key contribution to this goal. The other part was his drive to create a permanent and public centre for Civic Studies in every town in the form of an \"Outlook Tower\"(Geddes, 1949, p. xi). The Outlook Tower was to be the \"incipient Civic Observatory and Laboratory together\" in which the Science of Cities was advanced to its proper rank amongst academic and life pursuits (Geddes, 1949, p. 96). The institution Geddes sought to create placed \"its effort towards correlation of thought and action, science and practice, sociology and morals, with its watchword and endeavour of \"Civic Survey for Civic Service\"\" (Geddes, 1949, p. 69). Fastforward to late 2004, when the Urban Studies Program at Simon Fraser University's downtown campus initiated the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu), with a vision akin to that of Geddes. In the context of the new millennium, RVu was established as the first local observatory within UN-Habitat's Global Urban Observatory network in a developed country. The Global Urban Observatory was established in 1997 to institutionalize UN-Habitat's pioneering work in the generation and tracking of urban indicators, initiated with the Urban Indicators Programme in 1993. Following the creation of the Habitat Agenda at the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul in 1996, the mission was set for the Global Urban Observatory-to create and maintain a Global Urban Indicators Database that would permit UN member states and their cities to monitor and report on urban trends on a regular and reliable basis. The Millennium Development Goals, established by UN member states in 2000, and the indicators established for tracking these eight goals in 2003, update the mission of the Global Urban Indicators Database (UN-Habitat 2004). The MDGs represent a global compact for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, to be attained by 2015. RVu's work to date is being presented to the international community for the first time at the World Urban Forum III. The work thus far has constituted both expert-based and public participatory components. Experts affiliated with RVu have conducted regional and international research on urban indicator-related work, with some bearing on the Vancouver region and on specific indicators used by a range of projects in the major areas of urban capital: health, economy, environment, governance, culture, and infrastructure. Work in progress toward these research articles was presented at the first RVu public event, Focusing ouR View, in October 2005; and the best finished results are presented in this issue of Cities. Keys to the design of Rvu, and in particular its public participatory process, are presented in the first article in this issue, Urban Indicators and the Integrative Ideals of Cities, by Meg Holden. The paper presents the practice in progress of RVu's stance on urban sustainability as a community-based struggle to learn, indicators as a means for long-term learning, and the role of value-based citizen participation, within a theoretical perspective. Sustainable development, as a framework for long-term planning, has value in the Vancouver region for its \"constructive ambiguity\"(Robinson, 2004, p. 374), its pointers toward greater linkages among environmental, social, and economic priorities, without forcing a premature set of quantitative trade-offs. This integrative, vague, idealistic thrust also leaves sustainable development open to clashes with incremental, specific, and realist demands competing for time on the public agenda. Indicators can help bridge the gap; the articles in this issue begin to explain how. One article presents a bridge from the perspective of environmental economics, illustrating the complexities of measuring natural capital but also the need and precedent for this. The next article presents a way of thinking about indicators of governance for sustainable development from a starting point of allocating equal value to democratic inclusion of each citizen. Moving from the individual to the group, the final two articles ask for greater attention to socially, culturally and demographically-specific cases: new immigrants and Aboriginal people. Nancy Olewiler offers an economist's perspective on the design and utility of an urban indicator project, with a particular focus on natural capital. Her article, Environmental Sustainability for Urban Areas: The Role of Natural Capital Indicators, expands on one of the themes from Holden, the difference between descriptive indicators, which proliferate in policy contexts, and diagnostic indicators, which are rare. Olewiler presents the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and reminds us of the need to consider different indicators at each point in the chain. Her treatment of natural capital indicator issues locally includes useful information on Greater Vancouver's adjacent Fraser Valley Regional District. She looks south to the city of Santa Monica, California for an example of natural capital indicator development and institutionalization. Building on a theme introduced by Holden, Olewiler reminds us that indicators alone are not enough; effective indicators are those presented in a reasoned context with a clear path to actions. Indicators belong at the beginning, not the end, of a good governance process. The next article specifies much more clearly what might be meant by the notion of good governance. In Designing Good Urban Governance Indicators: The Importance of Citizen Participation and its Evaluation in Greater Vancouver, political scientist Kennedy Stewart makes the case for inclusion of governance considerations in any definition of sustainability. The political aspect of sustainability is poorly developed, compared to economic, environmental, and social aspects and this article moves the thinking ahead through treatment of democratic theory, along with work on defining 'good governance' advanced by the United Nations. Stewart draws on evidence of voting patterns in the Vancouver region to raise the spectre of systematic disenfranchisement, that seems to be on the rise. As Canada's only unamalgamated major metropolitan region, led by municipal appointments rather than direct elections, advances in sustainable development policy made by the Greater Vancouver Regional District are at risk if voting trends cannot be reversed. Stewart calls for stepwise moral reasoning, based on the premise of universal equal rights to rectify this wrong. The final two articles examine the limits of belonging to the project of sustainability in the Vancouver region, from the perspective of the region's newest residents and its ancestral residents. Robert Fiedler, Nadine Schuurman and Jennifer Hyndman, in Hidden Homelessness: An Indicator - Based Approach for Examining the Geographies of Recent Immigrants At-Risk of Homelessness in Greater Vancouver, focus on the dimensions of risk of homelessness amongst one particularly vulnerable group, new immigrants. This investigation brings to the fore the interaction of policies, economics, and cultures in explaining the complexities of homelessness and immigration trends in the region. Since about half of the region's population growth in the foreseeable future will come from international immigration, and an increasing proportion of new arrivals face socio-economic difficulties upon arrival, understanding these interactions is key to sustainability in a context of increasing cultural diversity and decreasing affordability of housing. First Nations researcher Nathan Cardinal puts an Aboriginal lens on indicators in his concluding article, The Exclusive City: Identifying, Measuring and Drawing Attention to Aboriginal and Indigenous Experiences in an Urban Context. Along with immigrants, Aboriginal groups constitute fast growing demographic cultural groups in British Columbia.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Holden M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2006.03.002","Text":"The World Urban Forum III: Vancouver. \"Better information for better cities!\" is the call that leads this special issue.

Experts affiliated with RVu have conducted regional and international research on urban indicator-related work, with some bearing on the Vancouver region and on specific indicators used by a range of projects in the major areas of urban capital: health, economy, environment, governance, culture, and infrastructure. Work in progress toward these research articles was presented at the first RVu public event, Focusing ouR View, in October 2005; and the best finished results are presented in this issue of Cities. Keys to the design of Rvu, and in particular its public participatory process, are presented in the first article in this issue, Urban Indicators and the Integrative Ideals of Cities, by Meg Holden. The paper presents the practice in progress of RVu's stance on urban sustainability as a community-based struggle to learn, indicators as a means for long-term learning, and the role of value-based citizen participation, within a theoretical perspective. Sustainable development, as a framework for long-term planning, has value in the Vancouver region for its \"constructive ambiguity\"(Robinson, 2004, p. 374), its pointers toward greater linkages among environmental, social, and economic priorities, without forcing a premature set of quantitative trade-offs. This integrative, vague, idealistic thrust also leaves sustainable development open to clashes with incremental, specific, and realist demands competing for time on the public agenda. Indicators can help bridge the gap; the articles in this issue begin to explain how. One article presents a bridge from the perspective of environmental economics, illustrating the complexities of measuring natural capital but also the need and precedent for this. The next article presents a way of thinking about indicators of governance for sustainable development from a starting point of allocating equal value to democratic inclusion of each citizen. Moving from the individual to the group, the final two articles ask for greater attention to socially, culturally and demographically-specific cases: new immigrants and Aboriginal people. Nancy Olewiler offers an economist's perspective on the design and utility of an urban indicator project, with a particular focus on natural capital. Her article, Environmental Sustainability for Urban Areas: The Role of Natural Capital Indicators, expands on one of the themes from Holden, the difference between descriptive indicators, which proliferate in policy contexts, and diagnostic indicators, which are rare. Olewiler presents the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and reminds us of the need to consider different indicators at each point in the chain. Her treatment of natural capital indicator issues locally includes useful information on Greater Vancouver's adjacent Fraser Valley Regional District. She looks south to the city of Santa Monica, California for an example of natural capital indicator development and institutionalization. Building on a theme introduced by Holden, Olewiler reminds us that indicators alone are not enough; effective indicators are those presented in a reasoned context with a clear path to actions. Indicators belong at the beginning, not the end, of a good governance process. The next article specifies much more clearly what might be meant by the notion of good governance. In Designing Good Urban Governance Indicators: The Importance of Citizen Participation and its Evaluation in Greater Vancouver, political scientist Kennedy Stewart makes the case for inclusion of governance considerations in any definition of sustainability. The political aspect of sustainability is poorly developed, compared to economic, environmental, and social aspects and this article moves the thinking ahead through treatment of democratic theory, along with work on defining 'good governance' advanced by the United Nations. Stewart draws on evidence of voting patterns in the Vancouver region to raise the spectre of systematic disenfranchisement, that seems to be on the rise. As Canada's only unamalgamated major metropolitan region, led by municipal appointments rather than direct elections, advances in sustainable development policy made by the Greater Vancouver Regional District are at risk if voting trends cannot be reversed. Stewart calls for stepwise moral reasoning, based on the premise of universal equal rights to rectify this wrong. The final two articles examine the limits of belonging to the project of sustainability in the Vancouver region, from the perspective of the region's newest residents and its ancestral residents. Robert Fiedler, Nadine Schuurman and Jennifer Hyndman, in Hidden Homelessness: An Indicator - Based Approach for Examining the Geographies of Recent Immigrants At-Risk of Homelessness in Greater Vancouver, focus on the dimensions of risk of homelessness amongst one particularly vulnerable group, new immigrants. This investigation brings to the fore the interaction of policies, economics, and cultures in explaining the complexities of homelessness and immigration trends in the region. Since about half of the region's population growth in the foreseeable future will come from international immigration, and an increasing proportion of new arrivals face socio-economic difficulties upon arrival, understanding these interactions is key to sustainability in a context of increasing cultural diversity and decreasing affordability of housing. First Nations researcher Nathan Cardinal puts an Aboriginal lens on indicators in his concluding article, The Exclusive City: Identifying, Measuring and Drawing Attention to Aboriginal and Indigenous Experiences in an Urban Context.

The aim of this court was to represent the interests of the indigenous people in these areas. An on-site analysis, diagnosis and assessment of the heritage elements was carried out from architectural, urban planning, historical, and intangible heritage perspectives.

Methodology: Engineering learning from earthquakes, based on a long-term seismic culture, became a continuous activity based on field observation, since more than a century. On the other hand, creating earthquake disaster prevention awareness and disaster preparedness can be achieved nowadays by education and active learning addressed to all levels of population, from elder generations to the younger ones, and from usual people to the representatives of authorities. The link between these two approaches is becoming more and more necessary in the context of high local seismicity: investigating the behavior of people, while using emerging technologies (computer-generated imagery, immersive virtual reality etc.), to obtain an active individual attitude. The general concept of awareness and preparedness trends evolved. To deal with earthquake-related situations, people are taught to take measures to prevent severe earthquakes effects, but we must take a step forward to get closer to the system that includes: research knowledge, innovation, GIS and specialized software, and more importantly, the access to all of these, through public and private involvement. Conclusions: The Vrancea seismic zone of Romania, as a natural laboratory, involves us with knowledge and individual perception and attitudes and we have time for improved engineering codes, exploring and experiencing some new learning modalities, refining new policies and regulations from this field, new scenarios for implementation of disaster measures. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Dobre D., Sorin Dragomir C., Georgescu E.-S.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/2\/022020","Text":"Experiential Learning for Seismic Protection Using Living Lab Approach in Romania.

us to simulate the movements of people more realistic as in real case. This paper developed human mobility system using random way point and random walk methods to model the individual movement of person in different places within area of Baghdad, Iraq. There are a lot of types of mobility model but we use Random Way Point (RWP) because it is simple, most common use and needs less memory and time for computation. The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city. Al-Sadar city is one of biggest population city in Baghdad, Iraq. It has three millions people population. We choose 5000 users moves from Al-Sadar city to two different places in Baghdad: Al- Khadmia and Al-Zawra. Al-Khadmiia is old and religion place and Al-Zawra is biggest public garden in Baghdad. In our work, we find the best ways that connect Al-Sadar city with both places. We decide the best ways depending on distances and traffic between them. It gives good method to build smart transportation and smart city using mobility and traffic models. .This paper will help urban decision maker to suggest the analytical model for urban space and have a clear picture about the city: how can it change, how do the people move in the city, what are the problems and how can solve them to generate smart city. \u00a9 2017 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Prefecture also drew respective plans for reconstruction to rebuild their cities, financially backed up by the prefectural and national governments coupled with special laws and measures.

The Basic Act on Reconstruction in Response to the GEJE 2011 (hereinafter the Basic Act 2011) prescribes that, considering the unprecedented national crisis caused by the GEJE, the act has the purpose of promoting the smooth and prompt reconstruction and revitalization of a vibrant Japan, securing financial resources, identifying afflicted areas as Special Zones for Reconstruction with institutional and tax measures and establishing a Reconstruction Agency to undertake tasks regarding integrated national measures (Art. 1). The Basic Act 2011 then prescribes its basic philosophy, adopting the idea of the building back better concept, promoting dramatic measures for revitalization that are not limited to physical recovery of afflicted facilities, but also reconstruction measures to assist individuals to overcome the disaster and lead prosperous lives while honoring local culture and enhancing people\u2019s ties with the community (Art. 2). The Act for Special Zones for Reconstruction 2011 was enacted as separate legislation from the Basic Act 2011 to implement the reconstruction measures. Under this legislation, afflicted local governments designated as special areas can acquire significantly larger budget funds from the national government for recovery and can deregulate their spatial planning under the Agricultural Land Act, the Forest Act and the Urban Planning Act. Via this funding and deregulation, they can plan recovery-related projects for disaster prevention: the promotion of collective relocation, functional reinforcement of fishery villages, land reallocation for the revival of affected city areas, basic construction to lead city centers towards recovery from the tsunami and disaster-resistant public housing. The Act on Town Planning for Tsunami Disaster Prevention 2011 allows prefectural governments to set tsunami hazard zones and municipal governments to make integrated town plans for tsunami disaster prevention. Under the act, prefectural governments can set the presumed tsunami hazard zones and special tsunami warning zones.

common with current global concerns over wise use and effective management of water, the Government of Bangladesh is committed to exploring, developing and using its water resources to the benefit of all users. To this end the Ministry of Water Resources published the first National Water Policy in 1999,whereas the paper focuses the Regional Water Management Plan (RWMP) with the intention of guiding both public and private actions in the future for ensuring optimal development and management of water that benefits both individuals and the society at large. This Paper aims to ensure progress towards fulfilling national goals of economic development, poverty alleviation, food security, public health and safety, decent standard of living for the people and protection of the natural environment. The Plan is presented in three phases: in the short-term (2000-05) it is considered a firm plan of ongoing and new activities; in the medium-term (2006-10) it is an indicative plan, and in the long-term (2011-25) a perspective plan. Implementation of the plan is to be monitored regularly and it will be updated every five years (IWRM, 2002). Water is central to the way of life in Bangladesh. Indeed, the river systems, many of which emanate from outside the country, have shaped much of the history, economy, literature and rich culture of the people. However, with a burgeoning population of 129 million expected to rise to 181 million by 2025 and to 224 million by 2050 (IWRM, 2002), the country faces many challenges ahead in an era of increasing globalization. Rapid urbanization is expected with 40% of people living in the towns and major cities by 2025, and 60% by 2050 (WARPO, 2001). Poverty is still endemic with over half the population classified as poor. In addressing these and other related issues, this paper sets new paradigms for the water sector, which include: decentralized water management; cost sharing and cost recovery; private sector participation; community participation; nontraditional financing modalities; regulation separated from supply; and new rights, obligations and accountability.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Hafiz R., Chowdhury S., Sultana S.","DOI":null,"Text":"The development strategy of sustainable regional level water management plan: An agenda for Bangladesh perspectives..
