Urban studies in particular has failed to consider the overwhelming impact of the automobile in transforming the time-space 'scapes' of the modern urban\/suburban dweller. Focusing on forms of mobility into, across and through the city, we consider how the car reconfigures urban life, involving distinct ways of dwelling, travelling and socializing in, and through, an automobilized time-space. We trace urban sociology's paradoxical resistance to cultures of mobility, and argue that civil society should be reconceptualized as a 'civil society of automobility'. We then explore how automobility makes instantaneous time and the negotiation of extensive space central to how social life is configured. As people dwell in and socially interact through their cars, they become hyphenated car-drivers: at home in movement, transcending distance to complete a series of activities within fragmented moments of time. Urban social life has always entailed various mobilities but the car transforms these in a distinct combination of flexibility and coercion. Automobility is a complex amalgam of interlocking machines, social practices and ways of dwelling which have reshaped citizenship and the public sphere via the mobilization of modern civil societies. In the conclusion we trace a vision of an evolved automobility for the cities of tomorrow in which public space might again be made 'public'.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sheller M., Urry J.","DOI":"10.1111\/1468-2427.00276","x":2.5599999428,"y":9.8100004196},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":4,"Cited by":303.0,"Year":1999,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Typhoid fever in children aged less than 5 years","Abstract":"Background. Calculation of the incidence of typhoid fever during preschool years is important to define the optimum age of immunisation and the choice of vaccines for public-health programmes in developing countries. Hospital-based studies have suggested that children younger than 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever, but this view needs to be re-examined in community-based longitudinal studies. We undertook a prospective follow-up study of residents of a low-income urban area of Delhi, India, with active surveillance for case detection. Methods. A baseline census was undertaken in 1995. Between Nov 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 1996, we visited 8172 residents of 1820 households in Kalkaji, Delhi, twice weekly to detect febrile cases. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings. 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases were detected. Of these, 28 (44%) were in children aged under 5 years. The incidence rate of typhoid per 1000 person-years was 27.3 at age under 5 years, 11.7 at 5-19 years, and 1.1 between 19 and 40 years. The difference in the incidence of typhoid fever between those under 5 years and those aged 5-19 years (15.6 per 1000 person-years [95% CI 4.7-26.5]), and those aged 19-40 years (26.2 [16.0-36.3]) was significant (p < 0.001 far both). The difference between the incidence of typhoid at 5-19 years and the incidence at 19-40 years was also significant (10.6 [6.3-14.8], p < 0 001). Morbidity in those under 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and need for hospital admission. Interpretation. Our findings challenge the common view that typhoid fever is a disorder of school-age children and of adults. Typhoid is a common and significant cause of morbidity between 1 and 5 years of age. The optimum age of typhoid immunisation and the choice of vaccines needs to be reassessed.This study was conducted to measure the incidence of typhoid fever among preschoolers. It was suggested that children aged 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever. However, it is important to re-examine this view, particularly in infants and young children in the low-income urban area of Delhi, India, through active surveillance. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings revealed 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases, about 44% of which were in children under 5 years of age. Morbidity in children under age 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and the need for hospital admission. The incidence of typhoid fever and the age distribution of the case varied between developing countries. Thus, the age patterns of typhoid fever observed in the urban study area may differ in rural areas within India or in other developing countries. A reevaluation of the optimum age and vaccine of choice is needed.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sinha A., Sazawal S., Kumar R., Sood S., Reddaiah V.P., Singh B., Rao M., Naficy A., Clemens J.D., Bhan M.K.","DOI":"10.1016\/S0140-6736(98)09001-1","x":2.1099998951,"y":6.6199998856},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":11,"Cited by":110.0,"Year":2009,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Making friends in Zurich's urban forests and parks: The role of public green space for social inclusion of youths from different cultures","Abstract":"Integrating the distinct cultures of foreign resident youths is a challenge for Swiss political and educational institutions.

During the past two decades, rapid urbanisation and the conversion of rural land for urban development have led to numerous social conflicts and tensions between the Chinese government and its people. SIA and public participation in development decisions have received increasing attention from the Chinese authorities as possible ways to tackle the problem. Based on a Guangzhou case study, this paper argues that the assessment and mitigation of adverse impacts on the community from urban development have been carried out with different objectives, core values and principles when compared with those in Western societies. It concludes that the poor prospects of SIA and collaborative planning in China lie not only in the weak framework for environmental legislation, but also in all institutions concerning state-society relations, the socialist governing ideology and traditional Chinese culture. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, to develop guidelines, thermal comfort ranges need to be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating different thermal environments in Damascus during summer and winter. A second aim was to define the lower and upper limits of the thermal comfort range for some of these indices. The study was based on comprehensive micrometeorological measurements combined with questionnaires. It was found that the thermal conditions of different outdoor environments vary considerably. In general, Old Damascus, with its deep canyons, is more comfortable in summer than modern Damascus where there is a lack of shade. Conversely, residential areas and parks in modern Damascus are more comfortable in winter due to more solar access. The neutral temperatures of both the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and the outdoor standard effective temperature (OUT_SET*) were found to be lower in summer than in winter. At 80 % acceptability, the study defined the lower comfort limit in winter to 21.0 \u00b0C and the upper limit in summer to 31.3 \u00b0C for PET. For OUT_SET*, the corresponding lower and upper limits were 27.6 \u00b0C and 31.3 \u00b0C respectively. OUT_SET* showed a better correlation with the thermal sensation votes than PET. The study also highlighted the influence of culture and traditions on people's clothing as well as the influence of air conditioning on physical adaptation. \u00a9 2012 ISB.","Author Keywords":"Damascus; Microclimate; Thermal comfort; Thermal indices; Thermal sensation; Urban design","Authors":"Yahia M.W., Johansson E.","DOI":"10.1007\/s00484-012-0589-8","x":0.4099999964,"y":8.6400003433},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":17,"Cited by":93.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Revanchist sanitisation or coercive care?

Cultural value changed through time, with a significant transition from intrinsic, intrapersonal values (spiritual, cultural heritage) to instrumental, interpersonal values (recreation, education). Additionally, cultural value varied between different mangroves depending on their public accessibility, and the evolving degree of human interaction with the ecosystem as urban development occured. Cultural values change as development transitions, though mangroves still play an important cultural role in a heavily urbanized environment. \u00a9 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Author Keywords":"Coastal; Ecosystem services; Mangrove; Recreation; Singapore; Urbanization","Authors":"Thiagarajah J., Wong S.K.M., Richards D.R., Friess D.A.","DOI":"10.1007\/s13280-015-0647-7","x":2.5999999046,"y":6.6100001335},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":23,"Cited by":66.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Urban sustainability transitions","Abstract":"The world\u2019s population is currently undergoing a significant transition towards urbanisation, with the UN expecting that 70% of people globally will live in cities by 2050. Urbanisation has multiple political, cultural, environmental and economic dimensions that profoundly influence social development and innovation. This fundamental long-term transformation will involve the realignment of urban society\u2019s technologies and infrastructures, culture and lifestyles, as well as governance and institutional frameworks. Such structural systemic realignments can be referred to as urban sustainability transitions: fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent societal challenges are addressed, such as shifts towards urban farming, renewable decentralised energy systems, and social economies. This book provides new insights into how sustainability transitions unfold in different types of cities across the world and explores possible strategies for governing urban transitions, emphasising the co-evolution of material and institutional transformations in socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. With case studies of mega-cities such as Seoul, Tokyo, New York and Adelaide, medium-sized cities such as Copenhagen, Cape Town and Portland, and nonmetropolitan cities such as Freiburg, Ghent and Brighton, the book provides an opportunity to reflect upon the comparability and transferability of theoretical\/conceptual constructs and governance approaches across geographical contexts.

Through an analysis of four themes constituting the landscape of Singapore's Chinatown, we unpack two different but interdependent versions of landscape reality: the construction of social meanings from the state's perspective and those derived from the lived experiences of Chinatown's inhabitants. In our first theme, we explore the multiplicity of meanings invested in Chinatown's housing landscape. For the state, urban renewal and public housing schemes in Chinatown represent the redrawing of landscapes along modernist lines informed by efficiency and rationality of land use, in tandem with the larger goals of nation-building. Among residents, however, the vision of modern living in everyday life was only a reality for a few; others experience the landscape in more contradictory ways. Second, in the landscape of community building, we show that state-initiated efforts at inculcating a sense of community have replaced the old spontaneous, interpersonal ties and the strength of organised vernacular associations. Inadvertently, these state strategies have in some ways actually been damaging and deleterious to community ties. In our third theme, we show how the state has, to a large extent, successfully rewritten the socially and physically polluted landscapes of Chinatown. Yet, there are examples of resistances where the state's vision of an unpolluted landscape has been punctured. Since the mid-1980s, a fourth imperative has emerged in the state's management of the Chinatown landscape in the form of attempts to conserve the landscape as a \"historic district\", a repository of the nation's tradition, history and culture. We show that there are different interpretations of the state's effort to revitalise Chinese culture in the conserved landscape and its attempt to cast Chinatown in the role of a \"common bond place\" for all Singaporeans. Singapore's Chinatown is thus a multicoded landscape inscribed with a multiplicity of meanings. It is neither used entirely as an ideological tool for manipulative ends nor does it fully embody the authenticity of daily experiences. \u00a9 1994.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Yeoh B.S.A., Kong L.","DOI":"10.1016\/0197-3975(94)90015-9","x":2.9400000572,"y":6.9200000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":27,"Cited by":55.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Moving young lives: Mobility, immobility and inter-generational tensions in urban Africa","Abstract":"This paper explores young people's experiences and perceptions of mobility and mobility constraints in poorer urban areas of Ghana, Malawi and South Africa within the specific context of inter-generational relations.

Indeed, years of cooperative urban planning between developers and those interested in ecology and habitability have transformed Portland from a provincial western city into an exemplary American metropolis. Its thriving downtown, its strong neighborhoods, and its pioneering efforts at local management have brought a steady procession of journalists, scholars, and civic leaders to investigate the \u201cPortland style\u201d that values dialogue and consensus, treats politics as a civic duty, and assumes that it is possible to work toward public good. Probing behind the press clippings, acclaimed urban historian Carl Abbott examines the character of contemporary Portland-its people, politics, and public life-and the region\u2019s history and geography in order to discover how Portland has achieved its reputation as one of the most progressive and livable cities in the United States and to determine whether typical pressures of urban growth are pushing Portland back toward the national norm. In Greater Portland, Abbott argues that the city cannot be understood without reference to its place. Its rivers, hills, and broader regional setting have shaped the economy and the cityscape. Portlanders are Oregonians, Northwesteners, Cascadians; they value their city as much for where it is as for what it is, and this powerful sense of place nurtures a distinctive civic culture. Tracing the ways in which Portlanders have talked and thought about their city, Abbott reveals the tensions between their diverse visions of the future and plans for development. Most citizens of Portland desire a balance between continuity and change, one that supports urban progress but actively monitors its effects on the region\u2019s expansive green space and on the community\u2019s culture. This strong civic participation in city planning and politics is what gives greater Portland its unique character, a positive setting for class integration, neighborhood revitalization, and civic values.

Derelict waterfronts and ageing neighbourhoods have been given new life, enjoying their reincarnation as landscapes of economy and leisure. A prevalent theme in Singapore's transformation has been the reclamation of landscapes to cater to new users, activities and agendas. Adopting a case study of the Singapore River waterfront, this paper analyses three forms of urban reclamation. They include reclaiming functionality, aimed at infusing the waterfront with new land uses; reclaiming access, as a way of opening up the landscape to more people; and reclaiming the local, as a way to commemorate local cultures and histories. While government planners and private enterprise are intent on developing a world-class environment, Singaporeans and visitors respond to this urban vision in different ways with some praising the dynamism of worldly transformations and others criticising them as a prelude to a soulless city. While some degree of worldliness is essential in any redevelopment, a fine balance has to be sought between the excesses of global urbanism and the parochialism of vernacular concerns. \u00a9 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Chang T.C., Huang S.","DOI":"10.1177\/0042098010382677","x":2.4800000191,"y":6.9000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":32,"Cited by":46.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Natural disaster and nuclear crisis in Japan: Response and recovery after Japan\u2019s 3\/11","Abstract":"The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan plunged the country into a state of crisis.

In this context, cities can be regarded complex entities driven by material and energy flows that entail consumption of resources and production of waste materials in the pursuit of economic welfare and social progress. According to a sustainability perspective, environmental, social and economic indicators must also be integrated into urban planning processes. However, methodological advances regarding the definition and development of sustainable cities are required since a consensus of indicators, weighting and data management is still lacking. In this paper, a multi-criteria approach that combines three methodologies: Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed and applied to a sample of 26 representative Spanish cities with different characteristics (i.e., population, location, demands, economy, topography and culture). The combined approach allows identifying the non-sustainable cities considering an offset of indicators from the three pillars of sustainability. With this purpose, the mentioned items are implemented in a DEA model of efficiency, being the inefficient cities with an efficiency score lower than 100% defined as non-sustainable ones. Finally, this multi-criteria method allows setting the target values for the assessed indicators (benchmarked values), which become objectives for the non-sustainable cities to evolve toward a more sustainable performance. The outcomes from the analysis have identified six cities that ranked worse, with efficiency scores ranging from 57.9% to 85.8%. According to the targets of socio-economic indicators, attention should be paid to AROPE rate (people at risk of poverty and social exclusion), unemployment rate and number of crimes, meanwhile lower levels of electricity consumption, municipal solid waste and on-site greenhouse gases emissions are desirable from an environmental perspective.

This paper presents the case of the Singapore River development zone as a \"hyper-symbol\" of Singapore's global urbanism. By creating a world-class riverfront not unlike the acclaimed waterfronts of London, Sydney, or San Francisco, Singapore's urban planners hope to project the city as a venue worthy of world-class tourism and leisure activities, an important node in international circuits of capital, and a vibrant city for both foreign visitors and local residents. Our paper, however, also argues that local forces and influences play a significant role in the waterfront's development. The Singapore River landscape is the negotiated outcome of both globalism and localism\u2014a dialectical landscape formed by dominant global influences on the one hand, and emerging local processes on the other. Fieldwork comprising a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews, and on-site observations provide evidence of such global-local interactions. The paper contends that the challenges at the river are symptomatic of the broader Singapore experience as the city-state grapples with issues of national identity, local empowerment, and community rights in the midst of a global convergence of tourists, capital, people, and cultures. \u00a9 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Chang T.C., Huang S., Savage V.R.","DOI":"10.2747\/0272-3638.25.5.413","x":2.6300001144,"y":7.0599999428},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":45,"Cited by":30.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"The middle class in neoliberal China: Governing risk, life-building, and themed spaces","Abstract":"Since the late 1970s, China's move towards neoliberalism has made it not only one of the world's fastest growing economies, but also one of the most polarised states. This economic, social and political transformation has led to the emergence of a new Chinese middle class, and understanding the development and the role of this new social group is crucial to understanding contemporary Chinese society. Investigating the new politics of the middle class in China, this book addresses three major questions. First, how does the Chinese state deal with problems of national sovereignty and political representation to create the middle class both as a legitimate category of the people and as an ideal norm of citizenship? Second, how does the recognition of the middle class norm take place in the practice of everyday life? Finally, what kind of risks does the politics of the middle class generate not only for middle class subjects but also for the disenfranchised? In answering these questions, this book examines a set of practices, bodies of knowledge, measures, and institutions that aim to manage, govern, control, and orient the behaviours, gestures, and thoughts of Chinese citizens. This investigation contributes not only to the understanding of the Chinese middle class society but also to the scholarly debate over the relationship between governmental apparatuses, subjectification, and life-building. Drawing on ethnographic information, historical archives, and the media, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars working in the fields of Chinese studies, Chinese politics, ethnic studies and urban studies, as well as those interested in culture, society, class and welfare. \u00a9 2013 Hai Ren.

In analyzing Dutton's career, I use a Gramscian conception of the role of intellectuals in creating colonial hegemony, against the backdrop of recent research on the relationship of geography to colonial discourse. Dutton worked and corresponded with key players in Britain's African empire. He was a major force behind early urban-planning programs in East and Central Africa and author of four geographical books. Permanently disabled by war wounds, he was also permanently infatuated with the moral rightness of British imperial culture. A concern for geography's professional relationship with, and the geographical legacy of, colonialism has emerged in recent scholarship on Africa, largely through studies of travel writing, fiction, and nineteenth- or early twentieth-century exploration geography. Later scholar-officials like Dutton sought to apply their knowledge to the shaping of spaces to serve the Empire's direct and immediate needs in Africa, even while trying to win the hearts and minds of its subject peoples. Around Timothy Mitchell's (1988) concept of \"enframing,\" I build an analysis of the spatial projects with which Dutton is most associated and show how Lusaka and Zanzibar were enframed by his plans. Through his publications and correspondences, as well as his seemingly omnipresent service, Dutton has an important legacy that has neither been articulated nor analyzed, one which points to the importance of contextualized biography for analyses of colonial discourse. I argue here for seeing Dutton as an intellectual in the service of colonial hegemony and its enframing spatial discourse, although the character of his agency exemplifies why that attempted hegemony failed.","Author Keywords":"Africa; Colonialism; Cultural hegemony","Authors":"Myers G.A.","DOI":"10.1111\/1467-8306.00082","x":1.6799999475,"y":6.8499999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":50,"Cited by":27.0,"Year":1989,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Space, culture and urban design in late modernism and after","Abstract":"Among the questions underlying recent debates about the architecture of the city, two are perhaps more fundamental. The first concerns the legitimacy of architectural practice: can we be assertive about how we should design our cities without seeking to enforce social assumptions which are ultimately authoritarian? The second concerns architectural theory itself: can we be specific about what architecture does without being reductive about what society is? This article identifies and criticizes two kinds of recent responses to these questions: the first is to defend an architecture of localism and containment in some new and some old ways; the second is to retreat into relativism, sometimes supported by the assertion that architecture is of limited consequence because society is increasingly independent of space. The article defends the view that we can and must be assertive about the architecture of cities in global rather than local terms. The experience of genuinely urban environments is about meeting, though not necessarily interacting with, other people, mostly unknown, who can be of recognizably different class, status, race or ethnic origin; it is also about exploring the strange, and becoming aware of, though not necessarily participating in, other ways of life. -from Author","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Peponis J.","DOI":null,"x":3.7400000095,"y":8.7700004578},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":52,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Imagining Portland's urban growth boundary: Planning regulation as cultural icon","Abstract":"Problem: In the 30 years since its creation, has Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation? Spirited debate about its impacts on land uses and values has inspired vivid descriptions by both supporters and critics and spurred the imagination of artists and creative writers. Purpose: The UGB has become a symbol, metaphor, and touchstone, as people read complex meanings into it that go beyond its simple legal function. This article looks at the UGB as a cultural icon. It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media.Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives. Takeaway for practice: In the world of 21st-century planning theory there is a strong assumption that many voices engaged in overlapping conversations can help shape more equitable and sustainable cities. Creative depictions of Portland's UGB show the role of cultural actors in shaping and enriching such conversations.","Author Keywords":"Culture and regulation; Oregon; Urban growth boundary (UGB); Portland","Authors":"Abbott C., Margheim J.","DOI":"10.1080\/01944360801944997","x":1.4800000191,"y":8.1499996185},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":56,"Cited by":24.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"'China's leading historical and cultural city': Branding Dali City through public-private partnerships in Bai architecture revitalization","Abstract":"Competing with other Chinese cities for investment and tourism, various governmental bodies with jurisdiction in Dali City have begun to make use of local historical and cultural assets in order to brand the city.

Discovering these unassuming places (e.g. restaurants) of a city will benefit the understanding of local culture and help to build livable neighborhoods. Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing. These places are potential recreational areas for all groups of people and could be improved regarding urban design and planning to make these public infrastructures more attractive. This work demonstrates how multi-source big geo-data can be combined to build comprehensive place-based representations for different groups of people. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Place semantics; Residents and visitors; Social media check-ins; Social sensing; Street view images","Authors":"Zhang F., Zu J., Hu M., Zhu D., Kang Y., Gao S., Zhang Y., Huang Z.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101478","x":2.9600000381,"y":9.529999733},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":61,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Key concepts in event management","Abstract":"In recent years we have seen an enormous growth of festivals and event activity and the literature within the field is consequently huge.

These people are too many to mention by name, but I owe all of them a debt of gratitude. While writing this book I was very fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of colleagues, particularly Lucy Horan and Ruth Craggs, as well as the support and encouragement of my other colleagues at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Finally, a huge thank you to John, Muireann and Aoife for absolutely everything.IntroductionIn 1991, Getz wrote that festivals and holiday events represented nouveau, alternative tourism (cited in Lee et al., 2008). How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of \u2018 risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of \u2018 emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature. Others, such as the sustainability of the sector's activities have been an issue for longer. Most recently of all, the question as to how festival and event activities are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated, in response to the harsh realities negatively affecting the health of the sector in very recent times. The 35 concepts that are discussed in this volume are laid out in alphabetical order. \u00a9 Bernadette Quinn 2013.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Quinn B.","DOI":"10.4135\/9781473914742","x":3.1600000858,"y":8.2600002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":64,"Cited by":21.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Population and climate change.","Abstract":"To review, the four broad dimensions of any complex human problem, including climate change, are the human population, economics, culture, and environment. These dimensions interact with one another in all directions and on many time-scales. From 2010 to 2050, the human population is likely to grow bigger, more slowly, older, and more urban. It is projected that by 2050 more than 2.6 billion people (almost 94% of global urban growth) will be added to the urban population in today's developing countries. That works out to 1.26 million additional urban people in today's developing countries every week from 2010 to 2050. Humans alter the climate by emitting greenhouse gases, by altering planetary albedo, and by altering atmospheric components. Between 1900 and 2000, humans' emissions of carbon into the atmosphere increased fifteenfold, while the numbers of people increased less than fourfold. Population growth alone, with constant rates of emissions per person, could not account for the increase in the carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The world economy grew sixteenfold in the twentieth century, accompanied by enormous increases in the burning of gas, oil, and coal. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, population grew much faster in developing countries than in high-income countries, and, compared with population growth, the growth of carbon emissions to the atmosphere was even faster in developing countries than in high-income countries. The ratio of emissions-to-population growth rates was 2.8 in developing countries compared with 1.6 in high-income countries. Emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are influenced by the sizes and density of settlements, the sizes of households, and the ages of householders. Between 2010 and 2050, these demographic factors are anticipated to change substantially. Therefore demography will play a substantial role in the dynamics of climate changes. Climate changes affect many aspects of the living environment, including human settlements, food production, and diseases. These changes will affect poor people more severely than rich, and poor nations more severely than rich. Yet not enough is known to predict quantitatively many details that will matter enormously to future people and other species. Three kinds of responses are related to demographic issues that affect climate changes: universal secondary education, voluntary contraception and maternal health services, and smarter urban design and construction. These responses may prevent, reduce, or ameliorate the impacts of climate changes. They are as relevant to rich countries as to poor, though in ways that are as different as are rich countries and poor. They are desirable in their own right because they improve the lives of the people they affect directly; and they are desirable for their beneficial effects on the larger society and globe. They are effective responses to the twin challenges of reducing poverty and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Cohen J.E.","DOI":null,"x":1.3200000525,"y":7.3800001144},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":65,"Cited by":21.0,"Year":2009,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Factors affecting compliance with residential standards in the city of Old Salt, Jordan","Abstract":"The aim of this paper is to examine the factors which impact on the extent to which urban housing complies with residential standards in the city of Old Salt based in Jordan. The research found that the level of compliance with residential standards is quite low and can vary from one standard to another and from one house to another due to differences in the socio-economic characteristics among people. The findings of multiple regression analysis reveal that there is a good level of public awareness of residential standards, but this does not result in complete compliance with residential standards. Factors, such as household income per month, household size, finance facilities, municipal administration culture, monitoring, enforcement and the uncertainty of residential standards have a significant impact on the extent of compliance with planning standards. Suggestions for improved urban planning practices which address these issues are summarised in the paper and include reassessed current residential standards through comprehensive legal frameworks, linking residential standards with urban design approaches, changing planning practices, developing information systems to produce effective monitoring systems of construction processes and enforcement mechanisms, the development of local staff including planners, designers and environmental engineers, supported partnerships between private and public sectors, and the use of participatory planning and citizen involvement.

Competitive spending among affluent households has intensified the importance of style and design at every scale and design professions have grown in size and importance, reflecting distinctive geographies and locating disproportionately in cities most intimately connected with global systems of key business services. Meanwhile, many observers still believe good design can make positive contributions to people's lives. ities and Design explores the complex relationships between design and urban environments. It traces the intellectual roots of urban design, presents a critical appraisal of the imprint and effectiveness of design professions in shaping urban environments, examines the role of design in the material culture of contemporary cities, and explores the complex linkages among designers, producers and distributors in contemporary cities, for example: fashion and graphic design in New York; architecture, fashion and publishing in London; furniture, industrial design, interior design and fashion in Milan; haute couture in Paris and so on.

In this paper, the author uses first hand information to chart the development and actual implementation of urban planning in the PRC using the national capital, Beijing, as an example. The study finds that the concepts, standards and methods used in the USSR had greatly influenced urban planning in Beijing between 1949 and 1991. However, there were also locally derived influences involved - Confucianism and Maoism. After 1978, market forces as well as contemporary Western planning ideas and methodologies started to have an effect on the planning of Beijing. Urban planning is perceived therefore as the combined outcome of culture, politics and economic development.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sit V.F.S.","DOI":"10.3828\/tpr.67.4.y02r48x8r267t7g3","x":3.4900000095,"y":7.7800002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":72,"Cited by":19.0,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Blue urbanism: Exploring connections between cities and oceans","Abstract":"What would it mean to live in cities designed to foster feelings of connectedness to the ocean? As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like \"community supported fisheries\" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more \"green.\" Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of \"ocean literacy\" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals. \u00a9 2014 Timothy Beatley.

A concentration of people in the same geographic area who are of similar ethnic background, culture and language can be an important source of financial and personal support, information and guidance, and social mores. Evidence is found that, after controlling for a range of other observable and unobservable factors important to the location decision, the concentration of people of a particular ethnic group in a particular area has a significant effect on the chance that new immigrants of the same ethnic group will choose to live there. The size of the effect, however, depends on the personal characteristics of immigrants. The attraction of ethnic concentrations of immigrants is significantly smaller for new immigrants with a university degree and for those who normally speak English at home. Characteristics of the local ethnic community related to education and language profiles are also significant determinants of location choice. \u00a9 2004 by the Institute of Urban Studies All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Author Keywords":"Immigrants; Mobility; Neighborhood effects","Authors":"McDonald J.T.","DOI":null,"x":1.5299999714,"y":9.720000267},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":78,"Cited by":18.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Scales, regimes, and the urban governance of Glasgow","Abstract":"Over the last two decades, urban regime theory has become one of the most dominant paradigms of thought in urban studies. In particular, regime theory offers a complex account of urban governance, or how local governments, the business communities, and community organizations gain the capacity to shape the policies that affect cities, that is, govern. Although regime theory is a dominant theory in urban studies, it does, nevertheless, have its share of detractors, and one criticism has been its failure to take into account geographical scale. While there is an acknowledgment in urban regime theory of wider economic processes, such as the broad transformations in international and national trade, investment, finance, etc., or the role played by federal or state governments, the bias has remained mostly local, particularly in regards to urban governance. In urban regime theory literature the policies and actions of international and national institutions either nicely conjoin with local interests or are nearly totally absent. Due to this oversight, urban regime theory tends to underemphasize how the capacity to govern a city effectively is sometimes the result of the interaction of actions of people at multiple scales. This article attempts to address this oversight in an analysis of Glasgow, Scotland, during the 1980s. By focusing on the role of the European City of Culture in the revitalization of the city, this article demonstrates how the capacity for a ruling coalition to transform the city and to govern effectively was the consequence of the policy and administrative actions undertaken at other geographical scales. \u00a9 2008 Urban Affairs Association.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Tretter E.M.","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1467-9906.2007.00375.x","x":1.0900000334,"y":7.0700001717},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":80,"Cited by":17.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Aquatic systems and water security in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico City","Abstract":"In megacities water quantity and quality are threatened by complex and interrelated processes caused by population growth, land use change, unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, erosion, destruction of ecosystems, lack of planning, laissez-faire policies, unsustainable water management, political conflicts, and increasingly also by the impacts of climate change.

In this wave of revival, many groups are marginalized, the reclaimed public space is often sanitized, gentrified and fortified, and not inclusive. However, there are urban public spaces that defy or at least resist these trends. Examining urban neighbourhood main streets reveals that even though the contemporary urban street can never be an unregulated place of unconstrained diversity, there are streets that counter the prevalent culture of consumption, and one can find visible signs of spontaneity and diversity of people and activities, and genuine social life. Using research in urban sociology, a taxonomy for sociability is developed, and the existing range of classifications of outdoor social activities is expanded.

Our scheme suggests five categories of conditions that together create Communities of Trust: Shared place, shared daily-life practices, shared basic beliefs, and shared perceptions of community interests and risks. This scheme was examined in five communities in Gaza city. Data were collected first by informal talks with residents and local decision-makers and then by means of 973 personal interviews in residents' homes. Undoubtedly, the human conditions of the people of Gaza are among the worst in the world. Living conditions in the city have been difficult for the past century due to a number of factors, including: waves of incoming Palestinian refugees of the War of 1948, and decades of Israeli occupation. In spite of difficult housing conditions, poor services and the pressure of lasting internal risks, this study found livable communities and strong trust relationships among people of Gaza's communities. This article explains this by the high levels of agreement on basic beliefs, the shared daily-life practices, the strong shared perception towards external risks and a few common interests, which were found within each studied area. The last part of the paper is related to the issues of generalizing from the case of homogeneous urban community in Gaza to the frequently heterogeneous communities of Western cities. This study concludes that trust relationships are the corner-stone upon which communities are based anywhere in the world. Hence, in order to sustain communities, planners should support trust relationships among residents. This requires culture-sensitive planning. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Community of trust; Gaza; Housing; Palestinians; Planning; Risk","Authors":"Jabareen Y., Carmon N.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2009.12.005","x":1.0099999905,"y":9.0399999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":88,"Cited by":14.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Hong Kong architecture 1945-2015: From colonial to global","Abstract":"This book focuses on the transformation from colonial to global - the formation, mechanism, events, works and people related to urban architecture. The book reveals hardships the city encountered in the 1950s and the glamour enjoyed in the 1980s. It depicts the public and private developments, and especially the public housing which has sheltered millions of residents. The author identifies the architects practising in the formative years and the representatives of a rising generation after the 1980s. Suffering from land shortage and a dense environment, the urban development of Hong Kong has in the past 70 years met the changing demands of fluctuating economic activities and a rising population. Architecture on the island has been shaped by social demands, the economy and technology. The buildings have been forged by the government, clients, planners, architects, many contractors and end-users. The built environment nurtures our life and is visual evidence of the way the city has developed. Hong Kong is a key to East Asia in the Pacific Era.

However, Lean philosophy has not been well understood yet in the construction industry for the fact that the complexity and dynamic nature of construction projects bring up uncertainties that may be hardly handled by construction practitioners. Moreover, project-based nature of construction business makes Lean implementation even more challenging for construction people. Even though Lean efforts in construction have recently increased, there are problems with the implementation processes. It is undeniable that successful Lean implementation strongly affects project performance. Therefore, it is essential to reveal enablers and barriers in Lean implementation so that the construction industry practitioners might conduct projects more effectively and satisfy project requirements (i.e. schedule, budget, safety). This study aims to provide a set of core enablers and barriers of Lean implementation in construction projects and guide construction professionals to better satisfy project requirements. Within this context, the study proposes seven major enabler and barrier groups, namely the financial, managerial, technical, workforce, culture, government, and communication and twenty-seven components for each group. Moreover, a survey was designed and administered to Lean practitioners to rank the enablers and barriers based on importance level. Clear understanding of technical requirements in Lean practices was ranked as the most important enabler of Lean implementation whereas lack of top management support was ranked as the most important barrier in the Lean implementation. However, the average rankings were not found to be diverging indicating that selected components of enabler and barrier groups are properly chosen. The study is expected to lead Lean practitioners with creating value to customers while preventing them from experiencing waste. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Bayhan H.G., Demirkesen S., Jayamanne E.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/2\/022002","x":2.3800001144,"y":9.4399995804},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":107,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Recognition of urban unsustainability in Iran (case study: Sanandaj City)","Abstract":"Rapid urban growth and urbanization in recent decades have caused changes in the structure of human habitations such as social and economic changes that would further clarify the importance of sustainable development and urban sustainability.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine various aspects of unsustainability in Iranian middle-large cities in order to provide strategies to improve the indicators and to achieve sustainability by finding the causes of failure to develop these indicators. Accordingly, first, urban sustainability indicators in four social, economic, physical and environmental aspects were presented. Then, the process of changing was determined through the study of these indicators in Sanandaj during two different periods; and indicators such as jobs, green urban economics, housing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), social participation, culture, public services and facilities, transportation, leisure, and medical care and health services were specified as unsustainability indicators in Sanandaj and other similar cities. Then, the following strategies are provided to improve urban sustainability in order to analyze the reasons for the decline or stagnation of these indicators: (1) strategies to revise the urban planning system in Iran; (2) strategies to improve the city's economy; and (3) strategies to improve the condition and status of poor people. The declining trend of unsustainability indicators could be reversed by applying these strategies.

Creative knowledge work is based on an understanding of language, culture and symbolic meanings. This can best be obtained through local and national embeddedness. Yet, this necessity for embeddedness stands in contrast to the demand in geographical mobility. How is this contradiction solved by individuals? What new forms of place attachment does this bring about? This book introduces a showcase of 25 multilocal creative knowledge workers, who live in different countries at the same time. It investigates how continuous mobility becomes part of their lifeworld, and how it changes their feelings of belonging and practices of place attachment. Applying an innovative methodological mix of social phenomenology, hermeneutics and mental mapping, this book takes a detailed look at biographies and the role of places in mobile lifeworlds. Plug&Play Places brings forth the idea that places have to be understood as individual items, which are configured and then plugged into the 'system' of the own lifeworld. They can be 'played' without great effort once an individual needs to make use of them. This new type of place attachment is a form of subjective standardization of place, which complements the well-known models of objective standardization of places. Plug&Play Places is relevant for scientists who deal with mobility and its impact on individual lifeworlds, with transnational multilocality and with flexibilized labour markets. Furthermore, the book provides a detailed qualitative perspective which can enrich the explanations of quantitative research in the same field. It is an interesting reading also for practitioners engaged in urban planning, housing and real estate development.

Although overshadowed by the crackdown on Prague Spring mere weeks later, the willful destruction of this historic landmark on a central site called Karl Marx Square represents an essential turning point in relations between the Communist authorities and the \u201cpeople\u201d they claimed to serve. As the largest case of East German protest between the 1953 Uprising and 1989 Revolution, this intimate local trauma exhibits how the inner workings of a \u201cdictatorial\u201d system operated more broadly and exposes the often gray and overlapping lines between State and citizenry. Through deep analysis of untapped periodicals and archives, it introduces a broad cast of characters who helped make the demolition possible and restores the voices of ordinary citizens who dared in the name of culture, humanism, and civic pride to protest what they saw as an inconceivable tragedy. In this city that later started the 1989 Revolution triggering the fall of the Berlin Wall, residents from every social background desperately hoped to convince their leaders to step back from the brink. But as the dust cleared in 1968, they saw with all finality that their voices meant nothing, that the DDR was a sham democracy awash with utopian rhetoric that had no connection with their everyday lives.

Selected Issues","Abstract":"Creation of the built environment and research in this field pose a particularly difficult challenge nowadays. The pace of social and technological change does not allow for evolutionary development of cities and the formation of their land use according to current conditions. Creating spatial solutions that are unmatched in their contexts is becoming not only possible, but very probable (see Alexander, 1964). The development of the built environment involves not only art, technology, history, economics and law, but also philosophy, culture, medicine, psychology, sociology and many other spheres in which human life is manifested. However, only a relatively small number of disciplines such as spatial planning, urban design, urban planning, etc. (ignoring at this point the differences in the meaning of the concepts) in their application layer are meant to create space and bear responsibility for it. Also society has certain requirements of practical nature towards them. This article attempts to outline the nature of research on space urbanised by people and to determine the four main fields of research aimed at the problems of man and the built environment. In the next part, particular attention is paid to issues related to the impact of the built environment on the life of its residents in order to highlight the particular role and complexity of this area of research. This study, acting as a kind of test of the research, cannot be considered representative. Nevertheless, the analysis prompts several reflections on the current and future role of the built environment in the development of our civilisation, as well as further challenges related to it. \u00a9 2016 European Spatial Research and Policy 2016.","Author Keywords":"built environment; physical environment; quality of life; spatial planning; urban planning","Authors":"Lamprecht M.","DOI":"10.1515\/esrp-2016-0011","x":1.6399999857,"y":9.4899997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":116,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":2000,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Integrative analysis of city systems: Bangkok 'man and the biosphere' programme study","Abstract":"This paper argues that integrative analysis of city systems helps us to see beyond their current environmental and social problems to underlying causes, and it suggests different opportunities for possible interventions. Focusing on a single aspect of a city or its people without understanding its context risks interventions which treat symptoms rather than causes and whose short-term 'solution' often means that the problem returns in the same or perhaps a different form. Our integrative analysis of Bangkok suggests that the root of its environmental (and some social) problems lie in decision-making structures and a political culture which has historically fostered self interested decisions by stakeholders rather than the public interest. This has produced a land use and built environment configuration that largely ignores the functioning of the natural flood plain ecosystem and the well-being of residents. People adapt their behaviour to their environment but often in ways that have serious cumulative impacts on the city. This analysis suggests that problems need to be addressed at their source: the nature of decision-making by stakeholders, at every level. This requires the engagement of all parties inside and outside government, the elite and otherwise. To the extent that planning has a viable role, the focus needs to be on the source of the impacts, such as national development planning, rather than in sectors such as transport, where the problems are evident.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Ross H., Poungsomlee A., Punpuing S., Archavanitkul K.","DOI":"10.1177\/095624780001200212","x":0.7599999905,"y":7.4899997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":117,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":1980,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Chicago sociology and urban planning policy - Sociological theory as occupational ideology","Abstract":"This account has provided one illustration of the possibility of an alternative approach to the sociology of knowledge other than the \"reductionist\" analysis of ideas as mere epiphenomena of material interests. If the sociology of knowledge cannot be pursued in any other fashion, the field's oft-lamented neglect seems entirely justifiable. But sociologists of knowledge can choose to define the purpose of their work, not as the exposure of perceptual distortions conditioned by social position, but as the elucidation of factors which lend certain formulations plausibility within a given socio-cultural context. Ironically, such explication of the relationship of ideology to work has been consonant with the developing Chicago tradition, although not unique to it, for Chicagoans have been concerned to elucidate the means by \"which people respond creatively to the limitations of their institutional context.\" As we have seen, the pre-World War II manifestation of that tradition has permitted urban bureaucrats to maximize their possibilities for action within the constraints of their formal obligations. Not only has their faith in the accuracy of evolutionist predictions sustained civil servants in the belief that they have maintained value-neutrality, but it has also allowed them to enjoy the pleasures of power and concrete accomplishment. For the city is conceptualized as an ever-expanding frontier, perpetually subjected to cycles of devastation and construction. Hence, while ostensibly acting as instruments of inexorable historical forces, urban bureaucrats are constantly provided with opportunities to raise tangible monuments to their personal authority. And evolutionist sociology has sanctioned a viable occupational strategy for the bureaucrat qua bureaucrat, for it justifies the civil servants' favored relationship with powerful clients, allowing them to negotiate their continued occupational survival. Although Chicago sociology has proved useful to planning professionals, I do not mean to suggest that its creators would have approved of the consequences of bureaucratic activity. In fact, both in method and substance the practices of government agencies have violated the human ecologists' ideal; Chicagoan Louis Wirth deplored planners' operational categories, arguing that they should be replaced with more sophisticated sociological ones. More importantly, federal officials used Chicago sociologists' projections to support policies counter to the Chicagoans' prescriptions for civilized society. Government policy has been effectively anti-urban. Based on the Chicago evolutionists' model, and in the name of sound business practices, central city decline has been assured and suburban expansion facilitated. Chicago sociologists saw conflict arising from large-scale urban migration and rapid industrialization, but they accepted conflict as necessary to progress; the highest development of civilization required diversity and an urban milieu. Within the city various groups created homogeneous communities, but heterogeneity of the population as a whole was essential to urban culture. Federal agencies, while adhering to the sociologists' premises, turned the model on its head; they sought to minimize conflict by eradicating social heterogeneity, and encouraged the growth of homogeneous suburban neighborhoods in which residents were protected from alien persons and lifestyles. \u00a9 1980 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Kuklick H.","DOI":"10.1007\/BF00169091","x":1.7599999905,"y":7.8299999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":125,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Below the double bottom line: The challenge of socially sustainable urban water strategies","Abstract":"Recent interview-based research on how Australian urban water professionals grasp the social aspects of sustainable water management suggests that interest in these dimensions outstrips understanding of them, and that more culturally intelligent, socially realistic and ethically sensitive notions of people, culture and society are needed.

COVID-19-induced immobility in the mobile risk society","Abstract":"Since the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) declared the Coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, the virus has invaded lives around the globe. The ongoing health, social and economic crisis that followed forced urban life, business, culture, community etc. into idle mode for weeks resulting from mandated immobility. What was once taken for granted as the essence of urban experience such as cultural activities, meeting friends, relatives and colleagues in public space or in professional encounters, disappeared overnight. Free movement became significantly restricted all over the world. It seemed that immobility, social and physical distancing, and isolation were the only antidote to the fast-moving virus. For many people, working from home while also schooling their children and providing social care at a distance, peak activity at maximum physical immobility became the \u201cnew normal.\u201d A culture emerged where rules and norms of mobilities previously taken for granted were re-negotiated and re-defined. Before the crisis and despite the negative ecological side effects, mobility has been positively connotated as a signifier for progress and success. Under the Corona regime mobility turned into a life-threatening risk. The theory of reflexive modernization, risk society and the mobilities paradigm are used to discuss these contemporary shifts and transformations. \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"automobility; COVID-19; crisis; mobile risk society; Networked urban mobilities; planning; reflexivity","Authors":"Freudendal-Pedersen M., Kesselring S.","DOI":"10.1080\/17450101.2020.1846436","x":2.2599999905,"y":9.6800003052},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":135,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Young adults and the decline of the urban English pub: Issues for planning","Abstract":"The numbers of English public houses or \"pubs\" have reduced significantly in the last two decades.

Using evidence drawn from a wider study of the relationships between places and youth drinking cultures, the paper discusses young adults' use of pubs. While recognising the adverse effects of heavy drinking, arguments are put forward in support of the traditional pub as a site for restrained and responsible social interaction for young adults.

Specifically, the article explores the relationship between the spatial dynamics of the conflicts-in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity-and the following four dimensions of urban space: social composition; built environment; propensity to associate and to voice; and accessibility to various urban resources. The results of statistical analyses by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Mann-Whitney test show, regardless of the dimension considered, to what extent certain areas are characterized by frequency, duration, or intensity of the conflict activity. Specifically, the results suggest that the degree of involvement of local people in a conflict varies very much depending on the nature of the social composition. Other findings show a relationship between areas with a high propensity to associate and to voice and a conflict activity that is more intense, more frequent, but not necessarily longer. These forms of social practices are thus testimony to the existence of know-how, i.e., a culture of conflict activity oriented towards efficiency. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Author Keywords":"Spatial analysis; Statistical analysis; Territorial decision-making processes; Urban conflicts; Urban environments","Authors":"Pelletier M., Joerin F., Kestens Y., Villeneuve P.Y.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12061-010-9050-8","x":1.25,"y":9.1999998093},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":146,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Festive Cities: Multi-Dimensional Perspectives","Abstract":"Until recently there has been limited attention paid in urban studies to features that relate to sensory, not material features, to consumption not production, pleasure not work, and to episodic rather than permanent characteristics. However festivals, episodic events lasting a few days, do provide such functions. They take people outside their routine behaviours of work, leisure and family, providing joy, excitement and new experiences, sometimes linking to historical traditions. Although such events have always been part of the life of the bigger places, new valuations of their utility have led to an enormous growth in such activities in recent decades, both in numbers within cities, and many other urban places, adding to their vitality and often providing major economic returns. A review of the variety of festivals shows that most fall into six main types, linked to temporal or cyclical, religious, political, tradition-heritage, new cultures and lifestyle functions, although some may overlap the categories and others have morphed from one type to another through time. A multidimensional model of the nature of festivals based on eight components provides a basis for assessing their varied character and reveals their often contradictory nature and conflicted consequences. \u00a9 2015, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Author Keywords":"Festival dimensions; Festival growth; Festival impacts; Festival typology","Authors":"Davies W.K.D.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-94-017-9655-2_14","x":1.6599999666,"y":7.5700001717},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":147,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"From designed spaces to designer savvy societies: The potential of ideas competitions in willing participation","Abstract":"The design of public space has gained importance as cities are increasingly positioned in global flows of people, capital, and ideas. These spaces speak to the culture of a place as much as to the quality of its design, but the implementation of design as an inclusive process is fraught with difficulty. This is particularly pertinent in discussions about better ways of engaging people with urban design, where there is often a language barrier between those who specialise in spatial manipulation and the broader 'society' that uses this space. This paper gives an empirical account of how a spatial consciousness can be translated to society through an international design competition. The competition method of urban design relies upon promotion and 'eventfulness', both of which interpolate the public and contribute towards the generation of a deeper interest in the spatial imaginary of city planning. The creation of 'urban design consumers' through the visual consumption of the designs themselves offers an alternative way to gain public interest to the established traditions of public notices and formal public meetings. In this case, the competition extended the activity of urban designers beyond the mechanics of 'space production' to include 'consumer production' where a more intimate relationship between city planning and the people began to emerge.","Author Keywords":"Competition; Consumerism; Public spaces; Urban design","Authors":"Picken F.","DOI":"10.1068\/a45460","x":2.8199999332,"y":9.0900001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":148,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Small businesses and the vitality of main street","Abstract":"People use the neighborhood Main Street for shopping but also for other leisurely activities, active and passive engagement, social affiliation and interaction, sensory stimulation, and relaxation. Traditionally, small businesses have made up a fair share of businesses on Main Street. Small businesses have been an integral part of the American culture of entrepreneurship, individualism, and self-reliance and have played an important role in American economic development. Community development programs recommend supporting small businesses for their social and economic benefits. This paper examines the role of small businesses in supporting public life on the neighborhood Main Street. The study urn conducted in two cities and one town in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. Extensive behavior mapping and interviews were conducted to determine the relationship between social interaction and small businesses. The findings expand our understanding of the social value of small businesses and suggest a strong relationship between small businesses and the vitality of Main Street as a result offour qualities of small businesses: uniqueness, engagement, friendliness, and responsiveness. These findings have implications for urban design, community planning, and economic development policies because they suggest that small businesses influence their immediate public space by paying more attention to it than large businesses.

It approaches the issue from within the post-socialist everyday experience of people living in a German-Polish twin city on the outskirts of the larger Berlin-Brandenburg Region. The article outlines a longstanding 'culture of displacement' as dominant for that area, and asks to what extent this rather peripheralized area is equipped to come to terms with the options and pressures of globalization and European integration.

The coordination of these (as we call them) \u2018domestic\u2019 city organisations has proven challenging. Extant literature argues that such coordination is achieved through a mix of various hierarchical, market and network mechanisms. Yet it is unclear how these modes are combined. Addressing this gap, we ask: How do governance modes interact in the hybrid coordination of domestic city organisations? Analysing the case of Vienna, where 100 domestic organisations employ about 60,000 people, we find that while cultural mechanisms, rooted in the network mode, are predominant, they unfold in the shadow of latent structural mechanisms, which are associated with hierarchy and market. In the background, structural mechanisms keep cultural coordination effective, while cultural mechanisms allow structural coordination to remain (generally) hidden. This study aims to contribute to the literature on the governance of public organisations by exploring the relationship between governance modes as well as furthering urban governance studies by applying insights from studies on the coordination of public organisations to the city context. \u00a9 Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.","Author Keywords":"(domestic) city organisations; coordination; governance; integration; Vienna","Authors":"Leixnering S., Meyer R.E., Polzer T.","DOI":"10.1177\/0042098020963854","x":1.6100000143,"y":7.8400001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":156,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Exposing globalization: Visual approaches to researching global interconnectivity in the urban everyday","Abstract":"This article explores how visual approaches to globalization as expressed and enacted in everyday life may enrich and complement the more abstract and mainly quantitatively supported discourses around this convoluted phenomenon.

In this article, we analyze local factors that are significant for urban planning to include in an integration plan through case studies in three cities in Germany. We have chosen to study Germany because of the country\u2019s touted Willkommen Kultur (welcome culture), which was prompted in large part by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201cFl\u00fcchtlinge Willkommen\u201d (\u201crefugees welcome\u201d) stance. Now, three years after Chancellor Merkel\u2019s declaration to the world, although international and national policies set many parameters for refugee integration, responses to the uncertainty of the situation are fundamentally informed by local contexts. Germany has adopted a policy of distributing refugees to communities throughout the country according to the so-called \u201cK\u00f6nigstein Key\u201d, which sets quotas for each state according to economic capacity. We have selected case study cities and a county that are at different scales and regions: Borken in Hessen (13,500 people), Kassel County (200,000), and Essen, a larger city (600,000). Here we investigate the ways in which German citizens and refugees interact and integrate, with a focus on the social-spatial aspects of refugee experiences and the impacts on urban planning policy, urban morphology, building typology, and pattern language formation. Beyond crisis, we are looking at how refugees can and will try to integrate into their host countries, cities, and neighborhoods and start a new life and how host communities respond to refugee arrival. Urban architecture projects for housing and work opportunities that help the process of integration are part of this study. Particularly, in this article, we investigate the reality on the ground of the positive Willkommen Kultur and the high expectations and implied promises that were set in 2015 by Chancellor Angela Merkel and German society. \u00a9 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Author Keywords":"Building projects; Pattern language; Refugee acclimatization; Urban design; Urban transformation; Welcome city; Welcome culture","Authors":"Neis H.J., Meier B., Furukawazono T.","DOI":"10.17645\/up.v3i4.1668","x":1.7899999619,"y":9.1800003052},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":161,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Applying social norms to high-fidelity pedestrian and traffic simulations","Abstract":"Smart cities are founded on complex interactions among architectural and urban designs, sensors, actuators and crowds of people with their devices. In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement. In order to allow for a more effective participation of humans in the simulation, our approach does not use central coordinators or coordination protocol, but rather each agent takes its own decision so to make more realistic interactions.

Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid-1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world's most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition, greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay. Campbell dispels long-held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize-winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision. As a national symbol, the Gateway Arch has a singular place in American culture, Campbell concludes, yet it also stands as an instructive example of failed urban planning. \u00a9 2013 by Tracy Campbell.

This is increasingly more critical for children and young people, as educating them to become better citizens, it also do strongly relate with development habits and their awareness of interacting with outdoor environments surrounding them. For inhabitants of cities to live an enriched life in every means, they require more than just the infrastructure and the trappings of material wealth: They require an attachment to a place, a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose, of which, a sound cultural development can help generate. Given the central government's recent emphasis in the 13th 5-year plan on encouraging creative and innovative industries, it is relevant to generate programs on cultural development focusing on younger generations. Through this, municipal governments can improve the quality of life and empower the young generation to shape the long-term prosperity of their cities. What are various ways to develop solutions based on strengthening community relations? What are the dynamics of relationship of people with each other from different social milieu?

The controls from the state and other pertinent forces led to the actual outcomes of political-economic ambitions and spatial policy rhetoric. It was an inherent feature of the society and economy to go outside of the state's controls, and the unintended consequences were unavoidable.

Toward this end, we propose a joint research program, namely, crowd-based communicative and deliberative e-planning (CCDP), a blended approach, which is a mixture of using an artificial-intelligence-led technology, decision-support system called D-Agree and experimental participatory planning in Kabul, Afghanistan. For the sake of real-world implementation, Nagoya Institute of Technology (Japan) and Kabul Municipality (Afghanistan) have formed a novel developed and developing world partnership by using our proposed methodology as an emerging-deliberation mechanism to reframe public participation in urban planning processes. In the proposed program, Kabul municipality agreed to use our methodology when Kabul city needs to make a plan with people. This digital field study presents the first practical example of using online decision support systems in the context of the neighborhood functions of Gozars, which are Kabul\u2019s social and spatial urban units. The main objective was to harness the wisdom of the crowd to innovative suggestions for helping policymakers making strategic development plans for Gozars using open call ideas, and for responding to equal participation and consultation needs, specifically for women and minorities. This article presents valuable insights into the benefits of this combined approach as blended experience for societies and cities that are suffering long-term distress. This initiative has influenced other local Afghan governments, including the cities of Kandahar and Herat as well as the country\u2019s central government\u2019s ministry of urban planning and land, which has officially expressed its intention to collaborate with us. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Ecosystem management; Municipal government; Nature-based solutions; Q-method; Urban forest governance; Urban planning","Authors":"Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez C., Kendal D., Threlfall C.G., Hochuli D.F., Davern M., Fuller R.A., van der Ree R., Livesley S.J.","DOI":"10.3390\/f11090963","x":2.7899999619,"y":8.1599998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":202,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Post-pandemic city: Historical context for new urban design","Abstract":"Cities have been almost completely unpre-pared for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Urban planning should concentrate on an organic relationship between people and their living spaces. The city is a product of Earth, a fact of nature, man\u2019s method of expression, Mumford writes in his The Culture of Cities (first edition in 1938). This also means that both the designer and the user must have a high degree of creativity in order to design and utilise the built environment. By analysing the definition of the city Mumford examines its changes during history from ancient times to recent planning method. He criticises the most dominant design processes of the 20th century: the functionalist and mechanical urban design. He is an advocate of the organic method in planning and understanding cities. The organic approach requires an active and creative approach as opposed to mere passive reception. This organic approach by Mumford to understanding cities is based on the theory of Kevin A. Lynch. We may distinguish 3 normative ways of city planning theory: (1) the cosmic, (2) the mechanic and (3) the organic model. In my paper I will first apply the onion model of culture developed by Geert Hofstede for the city and its analysis, and also for the appearance of creativity in them. After that I am going to examine the city with a special, architectural based mind map theory: the five elements by Lynch. Lynch suggests that these five elements (paths, edges, districts, nodes, landmarks) create the mental map for readability. Finally, I will investigate a usage of mental map in modern city planning (Le Corbusier) and works on the process of \u201cdebabelisation\u201d (Otto Neurath). \u00a9 2018 The Author(s).","Author Keywords":"City planning; Creativity; Hofstede; Lynch; Mental map; Urban design; Visual argumentation","Authors":"J\u00e1sz B.","DOI":"10.3846\/cs.2018.6901","x":1.2699999809,"y":8.029999733},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":212,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Lewis Mumford's Urbanism and the Problem of Environmental Modernity","Abstract":"This essay reconsiders the early career of Lewis Mumford and the assumption that modernity has been disastrous environmentally. Might it be possible to see Mumford, especially in his writings of the 1930s, as an early exemplar of green urbanism? Within environmental history, Mumford has been treated mostly as a regionalist - sometimes even as an opponent of the city. This essay argues that in fact his path toward ecological \"balance\" led directly through the city, not out of it. Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic \"renewal\" but also as a landscape full of what he called \"remnants\" and \"persistents\"; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. \u00a9 2016 The Author.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sachs A.","DOI":"10.1093\/envhis\/emw034","x":2.5999999046,"y":8.1000003815},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":216,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Swettenham pier waterfront redevelopment, Penang","Abstract":"A waterfront is a place where life of a city bloomed. Water is the source of life. Life is the practice of living. A waterfront signified a city's growth, bounded by water. Swettenham Pier is one part of Penang Island's east coast waterfront link, and happened to be at the sport where Georgetown started. The spot where in history, Sir Francis Light landed on this island and where Georgetown is established along with the blooming of international entrepot activities. It was glorious back in the late 80's. The main objective of this thesis is to bring back the glory moment of Swettenham Pier, giving back the waterfront to the people of Georgetown, people of Penang. Having to attend to this said aim, the redevelopment of Swettenham Pier waterfront is to give a chance to the people to claim a part of this waterfront, for living, for leisure or for any unplanned activities, as to establish its aim to contribute back to the local people, local culture and local living. This call for a strategy to design a waterfront to revive the history, while injecting new life to the place for people and activities to be carry on care freely. The design potential of this project is to look through the entire master plan of the waterfront and then move into the micro elements that support the entire scheme. The master plan plays a crucial role in supporting the waterfront with various types of activities that serve various demographics of users. The redevelopment of the new cruise terminal would also be explored thoroughly in conjunction with Penang Structure Plan in order to come out with the design that could cope with future development. One of the key outcomes of this research is that community magnet or a civic component inserted in the scheme will contribute back to the local people and culture. \u00a9 2015 AENSI Publisher All rights reserved.","Author Keywords":"Public spaces\/function plaza; Redevelopment; Revitalize; Socio-cultural; Tourist destination area; Urban design characteristics; Waterfront; Waterfront development","Authors":"Teoh Tong M., Ismail S., Yusoff S.Y., Utaberta N., Yunos M.Y.M., Ismail N.A.","DOI":null,"x":1.8600000143,"y":7.3099999428},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":217,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Planned to be reclaimed: Public design strategies for spontaneous practices of spatial appropriation","Abstract":"Several contemporary studies on public space focus on its loss, in relation to an increase in people's disengagement from these types of spaces.

It is imperative to harness the latent potential of existing settlements for an inclusive smart urban development. The study aims to assess the socio-cultural attributes of an Indian historic urban landscape with a thriving residential culture. Since data collection of neighborhood-level urban communities is not feasible in India, a structured questionnaire was used to conduct household surveys. Such real-world phenomena have inherent imprecision and ambiguity associated with human judgments. Therefore, the survey items are assumed as fuzzy linguistic variables, and the raw dataset is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy arithmetic and weighted averaging operators are applied for the hierarchical evaluation of indicators and variables. A robust algorithm is used for the dimension reduction of a fuzzy coded dataset while dealing with subjective responses. The aggregated fuzzy scores show an overall better performance of traditional communities with respect to their socio-cultural attributes, such as a sense of safety and collective efficacy. The application of fuzzy logic in urban planning and allied behavioral studies can effectively and pragmatically deal with the inherent uncertainties in a humanistic system.

While the subjectivity view is commonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of subsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion of beauty\u2014structural beauty\u2014among people and even different peoples, regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a physical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based on the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To verify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight pairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies that goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an opinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision, architecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and psychology. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Studies conducted by the 'Roselectromontazh' Association have shown a significant difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity, which is further confirmed by the reports of electric grid companies. In some cases, there is a 3-fold difference. This occurs due to the emergence of a sustainable culture of electricity consumption and the use of highly energy-efficient devices. In 2019, the results of the research work were taken into account in the regional urban planning standards of the Republic of Tatarstan. On average, the normative values have been reduced by 2 times. This enabled a significant reduction in the difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity. From 2020 onwards, leading construction companies in the Republic of Tatarstan are applying up-to-date values to decrease utility services' construction costs. For power grid companies the savings consist of reduction of electrical energy losses and 'locked electrical capacity' and the elimination of inefficient investments. It is important to note that specific values of electrical load were calculated taking into account summer and winter peaks in order to exclude the emergencies. However, it was impossible to predict a time when people would need to stay self-isolated at home to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019). Corresponding diagrams relative to 2019 were constructed to determine the impact of the electricity consumption of residential buildings during lockdown. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Calculated electrical load; COVID-19; Daily power profiles; Electrical power supply system; Locked electrical capacity; Standby electric power","Authors":"Soluyanov Y., Fedotov A., Akhmetshin A., Khalturin V.","DOI":"10.1109\/USEC50097.2020.9281179","x":0.9900000095,"y":8.2899999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":234,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban cohesion vis-\u00e0-vis organic spatialization of \u201cThird places\u201d in Saudi Arabia: The need for an alternative planning praxis","Abstract":"Many medium-sized middle-eastern cities like Khobar in Saudi Arabia have become a popular destination for predominantly low-to semi-skilled expatriate workers from several South and South East Asian countries.

Interaction between Russian and Chinese universities in the scientific and educational sphere has specific features and reflects the general mechanisms of functioning in social and cultural environment. The socio-cultural context of such interaction is the life activity of megalopolis, regional features and it is related to the socio-cultural traditions of people relationship. The general purpose of the study was to identify changes in interaction between Russian and Chinese students studying in a Russian University. The study conducted in Russian and Chinese Universities. The research methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The primary data was collected using questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Three hundred and ninety respondents - Russian students and five hundred respondents - Chinese students, were questioned on the basis of quota sampling. Depths interviews were conducted with 20 experts. The study has revealed some actual issues and tendencies of social interaction in the educational sphere. It has a temporal character and it is developed in a single educational environment of universities-partners of Russia and China. The study has identified the structure of social interaction, consisting of five levels: 1. At the level of connectivity, social relations between social and ethnic groups (in this case, Russian and Chinese students) are established on the basis of their values. 2. At the level of translation, understanding of the values of another (different) culture through the interpretation of cultural codes (cultural signs) takes place. 3. At the level of transcendence, transition from one's cultural system to another, the development of positive experience and knowledge of another cultural system take place. 4. At the level of adaptation, an interiorization, application in behaviour and activity of values of other cultural system take place. 5. At the level of inter cultural dialogue, an organization of effective and fruitful cooperation between social and ethnic groups and their representatives based on an understanding of the universal values takes place. The five levels of social interaction identified by researches in the joint educational environment of Russian and Chinese universities allow not only to find out the content components of the structure of social and cultural interaction, but also to consider its dynamics and development. Our research has identified a set of factors that affect the functioning of the interaction between Russian and Chinese students structure: geopolitical situation, cost and quality of education, adaptation of training courses for foreigners, comfort of the educational environment of University, the complexity of learning of the host country language, the prestige of education. This model of interaction between social and ethnic groups of Russian and Chinese students being representatives of partner universities is confirmed by the real practice of scientific and educational cooperation between Russian and Chinese universities.

Contemporary City as Adaptable Hybrid","Abstract":"Global space - both natural and cultural - is the greatest good belonging to the human community. The said community has, therefore, the right and responsibility to protect it, wisely and in solidarity, from wasteful exploitation. The postulate of public utility of this good must also presume such mutual conditioning of the rights and obligations of private owners that would minimise the chance of their infringement of collective interests. The culture of space management became an important measure of cultural level of societies at the turn of the 20th century, perhaps one of those moments which decide upon the future of our civilisation. The conclusion that large agglomerations in particular are \"incorrigible zones of spatial and social pathology, from which we need to escape into pristine areas and there create a more perfect living environment\" is unacceptable, also from the ethical point of view, both as regards the people living in those agglomerations and nature. As far as what has been created by man is concerned, we need to assume that we are able to control and improve this material creation of our civilisation. Such is the fundamental requirement of sustainable development - a difficult, but probably the only way of managing \"the global village\" in the millennium that has just commenced. The spatial structure of the contemporary city as a whole is a broken form: it has formally expressive and perfectly composed elements, it has mutilated compositions, chaotic arrangements and \"lost spaces\", finally, it has spaces that as yet have not been properly used compositionally and are still waiting for their role in the whole. A broken form - in compliance with the principle of irreversibility - may not return to its original composition. Thinking about the future of the city and taking into account the irrefutable fact that a considerable part of the built environment of tomorrow already exists today, we should ask ourselves the question: can it adopt, as a whole, a composition of a different kind? If the urbanised environment, being the basic one, is also to become a full-value environment for human existence, it will require continuous and universal improvement of its quality, as well as new strategies, methods and scenarios for rational organisation of urbanised space that will be able to meet new challenges. It seems that \"dramaturgically consistent logic of composition\" may become an original formula of urban public space. Scenarios built on the basis of the city \"genotype\", in which urban \"layers of memory\" are the basis for adaptive transformations. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Franta A.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/9\/092030","x":1.1499999762,"y":8.3699998856},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":245,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"'This place has potential': Trash, culture, and urban regeneration in Tallinn, Estonia","Abstract":"The article analyses the use of cultural programmes and trash as tools for urban speculation in Tallinn, Estonia, naturalising an urban strategy that entails extensive spatial revaluation and socioeconomic intervention. Through an anthropological perspective focused on concepts of potential and trash, the analysis shows how the central-north shoreline was mobilised discursively as a wasteland and a zone of unrealised potential to justify capitalist development of the area. The way it was framed, both moving towards completion and as a playground for cultural activities and young people, increased the value and accessibility of the area, but also allowed real estate developers to exploit the synergies generated and make profit from the revaluated plots. Tropes of potential and trash appear thus as discursive tools for urban regeneration, co-related with a formal allocation of resources and official permits.

As the proportion of people living in cities in China quintupled from 1950 to 2014, from 11% to 54% according to a 2009 report by McKinsey, while at the same time various challenges have paved the way to limit cultural prosperity and quality of life in cities. Cities currently face number of problems: Vehicle-oriented streets are not friendly to pedestrians; public spaces are designed without users in mind [1]; communities are isolated from one another [2]; and finally creative industries are lagging behind other industries according to a 2014 Forbes report. It seems that China's urban development states a condition of \"survivability\" rather than \"livability\". What is understood from the notion of livability within a city today is to be able to sustain quality of life through holistic planning strategies rather than purely economic ones. Such cities create robust natural environments as well as built environments, social equity as well as social stability. And as a result both a more reliable creative prosperity and economic prosperity have been maintained. This paper will seek to establish a 3-pillar approach to social inclusion and will examine each of these through issues related with migrants in China facing today. It seems that there is a great potential in using mobile and web-based technologies to generate rapid and sustainable solutions for migrants. There is also an enormous potential to develop feedback mechanisms for these solutions that can become part of the 'culture' of living in big cities in China. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"hukou; livability; migrants; mobile technology; social inclusion","Authors":"Gorgul E., Luo L., Rivera C.R., Jesseph B.-A.H., Hamel J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.proeng.2017.07.105","x":2.2799999714,"y":7.8099999428},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":251,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Future metropolis","Abstract":"Florida is an American urban studies theorist, head of the Martin Prosperity institute at the Rotman school of Management, university of Toronto, and a doyen of the urban planning sector, so when he speaks the community listen.

From its founding, Philadelphia's unfolding futures were consistently dynamic, focusing the energies of colonial expansion, democratic governance, and industrialization in one urban crucible. No other city in America exhibited each trend so dramatically. It was the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876- with the glass and steel dome of its Memorial Hall, its displays of telegraphy and the telephone, its prototype steam automobiles-that first demonstrated to Americans what an industrialized nation might really look like. Ed Bacon was an enthusiast of world's fairs and public exhibitions, writing and speaking of them throughout his career to illustrate and promote trends in urban development, and working in the genre himself to advance a far-reaching planning agenda for Philadelphia in the postwar decades. Philadelphia emerged from World War II burdened by creaking infrastructure and a housing shortage, its Center City business district underperforming against rival cities. Deindustrialization was already noticeable by the mid-1950s, an emerging economic reality that foretold difficulty in achieving the social goals of a new and aggressive generation of reform-minded political leadership.1 Residents were embarking for the suburbs at a steady clip, with the city falling by 1960 from third to fourth in population behind Los Angeles.2 Bacon's 50-year vision projected against this backdrop might have struck the reader as cheerful but unrealistic, even na\u00efve. But what good is a prophecy if it does not reveal a hidden future, a future obstructed? Bacon's future was a city revitalized, beautified, and modernized in time to host the nation's Bicentennial celebration and a simultaneous 1976 Philadelphia World's Fair. Imaginative planning was his method, enabling the political gatekeepers along with the citizens of the city to see with him decades ahead and to grasp the occasion of a fair to accomplish lasting change for the city's built environment and its people. \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009\" builds its case on this one powerful idea: A world's fair could transform it into a model of humane urbanism.3 Considering his vantage point in 1959, it is possible to imagine why Ed Bacon might predict the future of Philadelphia with such mesmerizing flourishes. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC), under his directorship, was in the midst of one of the longest winning streaks any urban planning body had or has ever achieved. With Penn Center, Society Hill, Independence Mall, the neighborhoods of Eastwick and the Far Northeast each underway or finished, Bacon and his team of young planners were totally in their stride in 1959, working to think, dig, and build the city out of its rut. The Market East transportation center, a pedestrian-friendly Chestnut Street, and a tourist-friendly Delaware waterfront were all on Bacon's drawing board, too. These were the varied pieces, described in turn by each of the authors in this volume, of a full urban-renewal portfolio advanced consistently over more than two decades by the PCPC. Postwar federal legislation enabled city officials for the first time to broadly exercise eminent domain powers, moving masses of residents and bulldozing whole sections of the city, planning and building anew.4 Ed Bacon's PCPC was certainly of its time in this respect and forceful in its place, stirring up both wonder and backlash. The old industrial city, the city that had lain fallow through the Depression and World War II, was awakening slowly to the possibility of highrises and integrated transportation hubs, and at the same time rediscovering its walkable character and the vernacular beauties of its historic neighborhoods. Bacon's idea was to liberate William Penn's grid from over a century of industrial-age clutter and to make the city simultaneously auto-, pedestrian-, and investment-friendly. Bacon understood the power of display and salesmanship as keys to making his idea of the next Philadelphia into something tangible. In this spirit, his \"2009\" essay arrived on newsstands in 1959. Could new high-rises and a suburban-style shopping center downtown reverse massive job losses and a suburban exodus? Whether the PCPC's projects were comprehensive enough remained an open question in 1959. In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The \"2009\" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's \"2009\" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the \"master planner\" and by extension New Deal\/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009.\".

Grant and Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil entered Machinery Hall to open the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Since early morning, the day's 186,000 attendees had been streaming through the gates. The president and the emperor stood in front of thirteen acres of motionless machinery, all connected by pulleys, shafts, wheels and belts to the giant Corliss engine in the central transept. Several hundred invited guests, already waiting there, made room for the ceremonial party to climb upon the concrete base of the huge metal monster towering forty feet above their heads almost to the trussed roof of the Hall. Machinery Hall was one of five major buildings put up by exhibition organizers in Fairmount Park; outside groups built dozens more. The Main Building was the largest in the world at the time-over a third of a mile long. Visitors marveled at the items on display: A typewriter, Hires root beer, the Statue of Liberty's torch, the Westinghouse air brake, Fleischmann's yeast, cable from the Brooklyn Bridge, Bell's telephone, and Otis's elevator.2 The Centennial was a resounding success, dramatically displaying Philadelphia's wealth and industrial might. Over nine million people-nearly one-fifth of the country's population-attended before its close in November. It was the first international exposition held in the United States and probably the single most important cultural event of its era. Foreigners flocked to Philadelphia-inaugurating mass tourism to the United States-to see American industrial innovations and dozens of foreign exhibits from Britain, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Japan, China, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and \"two large Arab tents.\" This influx of visitors and national cultures also opened Philadelphia andthe United States to a world of new influences; the Japanese exhibit in particular stirred an Oriental design fashion in the United States.3 Beyond the pomp, the fanfare, the hotel receipts, and the visitors, the Centennial also helped restructure the city's politics. The event both cemented networks of alliances among previously divided elites and marked the ascendance of a Republican hegemony in local political culture that would be virtually unchallenged for the next sixty years. The Republican regime that coalesced in the 1870s combined several elements: party bossism centered in control of several city agencies, an electoral machine that came to trade votes for public construction contracts, business support based in ideological solidarity (support for protectionist legislation), and reliance on rail- And port-related industries as the engine of the city's economy. In Philadelphia's case, the irony is that those Republicans who did the most to make the Centennial happen-large, reformist civic organizations like the Union League that played crucial roles in event planning and in promoting commitment to the Republican Party-did not necessarily enjoy the political fruits of their labors. Over time, the elite's cultural and ideological commitment to Republicanism became a straitjacket, and they lost control of the polity they had helped build. More broadly, I use the example of the Centennial to examine the role that cultural projects play in urban governance. These projects, and the planning efforts that produce them, contribute to the emergence and consolidation of governing regimes out of situations of extreme political discord and fragmentation. They connect processes of elite network formation (social capital) and ideological consolidation. These two processes in turn are the building blocks of hegemony in local governance-cultural and social leadership that shapes people's political commitments and the extent to which they are willing to consider or pursue alternatives to prevailing arrangements. \u00a9 2006 by Temple University Press.

The proposed methodology was tested with the design of a Smart Village in Egypt, awarded the second prize in an international competition. Our design approach is based on environmental and social sustainability and works as a genetic algorithm. This process generates the sustainable architecture of the village using the behaviour of biological creatures in artificial systems. The design ultimately ensures that our architecture is nurtured by renewable energies and built with re-cycled materials. The disposition of public spaces and the flexible organization of different functions are conceived in order to stimulate social sustainability, allowing the community to be interdependent as much as an ecosystem. Local cultures, typologies, materials and climate build the DNA of both the village and its buildings. We apply concepts from artificial life, using \"creatures\" that follow simple low-level rules in order to get high-level group behaviour. By combining the principles of artificial life and architecture, we get both high energy-efficiency and optimal placement of built units on a specific site. As in any ecosystem, a fractal, coherent, continuous fluctuation at every scale of the system is vital, and this kinetic flexibility is achieved at four levels: 1) decentralized urban planning; 2) reconfigurable spaces; 3) modular building blocks; 4) kinetic structures that respond to light, climate and people.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Magnoli G.C., Bonanni L.A., Khalaf R.","DOI":null,"x":1.2100000381,"y":8.0900001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":271,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Exploring Cities and Countries of the World.

Urban livability is often measured based on various measurable aspects such as stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure as stated in EIU's Global Liveability Ranking. However, these indicators often neglect the nature and processes by which places are made that form people's sense of place much more than the physical availability of urban amenities. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the critical perspective and contribution that placemaking brings to the measures of urban livability. This theoretical study analyzes key concepts and frameworks from secondary data such as reports and journal papers with the inductive content analysis method. Through the lens of placemaking principles, the gaps in many urban livability measures are identified. It is proposed that urban livability measure should incorporate placemaking principles of being community-driven, local assets, bottom-up, and trans-disciplinary to enhance the human-environment quality of urban livability. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Christy F., Raissa G., Sihotang S., Wijaya K.","DOI":"10.1088\/1755-1315\/764\/1\/012016","x":1.2400000095,"y":8.8299999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":278,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"(Re)framing spatiality as a socio-cultural paradigm: Examining the iranian housing culture and processes","Abstract":"With rapid changes in urban living today, peoples\u2019 behavioural patterns and spatial practices undergo a constant process of adaptation and negotiation.

This specific typology of museums intends to explain the nearby historical site through the use of multiple interpretation strategies. Understanding the visitors' expectations is an important component in the success of cultural institutions. Exploring the components of a visitor experience and expectations within site interpretation centres has, so far, received limited attention. Hence, this research intends to analyse the visitors' experience and expectations in a specific site interpretation centre in Bahrain: Qalat al Bahrain Site Museum. The visitor's experience and expectations were assessed through two streams of feedbacks. First, an analysis of the comments recorded on the visitors' book. These comments addressed the visitors' reflections, expectations, experiences, and the type of activities undertaken within the premises. Second, the online TripAdvisor from 169 valid returns, 200 TripAdvisor comments and an overview of the visitors' written comments, different types of emotional and spiritual experience expectations were extracted for further analysis... In parallel, this research analysed visitors' behaviour through observation inclusive of different timings during the day and during the year to understand the impact of climatic condition on the visitors' experience and expectations for validation purposes. Finally, some related scholarship discussions and suggestions were proposed based on visitors voice and reflection underlining the reasons why people choose to visit site interpretation centres with reference to personal and social demands. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Al-Saffar M., Anissa Tabet Aoul K.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/5\/052006","x":2.6600000858,"y":8.3299999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":306,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Experiential Learning for Seismic Protection Using Living Lab Approach in Romania","Abstract":"The purpose of the research: The paper is going to present the role of seismic areas as living labs\/natural laboratories for studying the behavior of buildings and of people and establishing a relationship between a research, a training-education and a knowledge dissemination. The results materialized by experiential actions to reduce negative impacts of disasters are highlighted. Methodology: Engineering learning from earthquakes, based on a long-term seismic culture, became a continuous activity based on field observation, since more than a century. On the other hand, creating earthquake disaster prevention awareness and disaster preparedness can be achieved nowadays by education and active learning addressed to all levels of population, from elder generations to the younger ones, and from usual people to the representatives of authorities. The link between these two approaches is becoming more and more necessary in the context of high local seismicity: investigating the behavior of people, while using emerging technologies (computer-generated imagery, immersive virtual reality etc.), to obtain an active individual attitude. The general concept of awareness and preparedness trends evolved. To deal with earthquake-related situations, people are taught to take measures to prevent severe earthquakes effects, but we must take a step forward to get closer to the system that includes: research knowledge, innovation, GIS and specialized software, and more importantly, the access to all of these, through public and private involvement.

Accordingly, when a city decides to make a bid, all its concerns is much more captivated by the urban transformation impact on the city whether it's a positive or a negative one. As a result, several factors, if not well-organized and taken into consideration in the strategic development plans of the host cities, may be a burden on the city. Site selection for the event is considered one of the main critical decisions to assure the possibility of the host of the Games by the city. Therefore, this paper reviews several case studies that proved its success in location choice under the delivery of sustainable urban design and strategic planning for the host city. It attempts to mention the main urban design elements affected by the preparation process. Consequently, an urban design sustainable assessment will be developed highlighting both the main urban design factors affected due to the host of the Olympic Games and, the main sustainable key factors affected by the urban changes on site. \u00a9 2019, Cairo University.

This bay is also famous for many floating fishing villages where the people live together on the sea as a community. However, due to rapid population growth in the floating villages, the present situation shows lacks in urban planning, waste management and development of infrastructure. Ha Long Bay had suffered the pressure of environmental pollution and resource degradation. Since 2014, in order to protect the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the local authority has planned a project to demolish the floating villages and move these communities to the mainland. In fact, the demolition project has caused the loss of cultural heritage and a tourist attraction in Ha Long Bay. The goal of this study is to propose a sustainable concept of living space organization for Cua Van, the largest floating village in Ha Long Bay, in order to preserve, revive, and promote floating communities as a unique heritage culture and tourist attraction. Therefore, a detailed analysis of environment and socio-cultural, economic, architectural characteristics of Cua Van is provided in this study. The analysis does not only accumulate precious traditional values that need to be preserved and developed in the proposed concept but also illustrate its weakness that need to be addressed to optimally design the future sustainable floating village. Based on these studies, as well as on general principles of a sustainable floating community and promoting ecotourism, the study proposes a living space concept for Cua Van, including solutions to both a sustainable floating community adapting to climate change and ecotourism development. The proposed concept would ensure stable and permanent living on the water for water dwellers and reduce human-induced impacts on the environment as well as an increasing livelihood income by tourism development. \u00a9 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Climate change; Ecotourism; Floating villages; Sustainable floating community","Authors":"Trang N.T.T., Vukorep I., Stopp H.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-10804-5_2","x":2.4200000763,"y":8.3999996185},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":325,"Cited by":null,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"To plan, design and evaluate \u201curban mending\u201d","Abstract":"Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical provides researchers concerned with the problem of the urban periphery with three suggestions. The first is to renounce any specialized approach that is based on an acritical confidence in the power of science and technology to solve the complex problems of today\u2019s world, particularly those that concern the environment and the poor. The second is to adopt an approach based on a \u201cculture of care\u201d for nature and for the most vulnerable people, and third approach is to include people (especially those who are weakest) in transparent decision-making processes that affect the quality of their lives. Starting from these suggestions, and from Renzo Piano\u2019s statement that, at present and in the future, \u201cthe mission of architecture is to save the outskirts\u201d through \u201ca huge work of mending\u201d, we believe that researchers should, with humility, make use of the \u2018urban-mending\u2019 approach when dealing with the complexity of regeneration projects. At the levels of both the architectural project and urban planning, they should adopt an integrated, interdisciplinary approach that is lighter and more sensitive than those used in the past. This will help them to face up to the multidimensionality and complexity of redeveloping peripheral areas. All stakeholders, especially the weakest people in society, should be empowered and involved in public decision making and planning implementation. Finally, genuine participation of the marginalized, excluded and disaffected inhabitants of peripheral areas (i.e., the outcasts) can be achieved using a \u201cdeliberative-democratic\u201d approach. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Author Keywords":"Evaluation; Inclusion empowerment; Urban distressed areas; Urban mending; Urban regeneration project","Authors":"Berni M., Renzi R., Rossi R.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-78271-3_12","x":1.7100000381,"y":9.0699996948},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":328,"Cited by":null,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"City and Urbanity in the Social Discourse","Abstract":"The aim of our article is an attempt to present the concept of urbanity that has been shaped throughout centuries along with the development of European civilisation and now entered a new phase of social production of space based on cultural dimensions. The future of the majority of World's population is connected currently with the urban life with the assumption that qualitative characteristics of life in the 21st century define the quality of civilisation itself. Contrary to many scientists' predictions of the decline of the city and urbanity, new reviving urban projects, social local activities and everyday urbanism appear which are connected with redefinition of the city as a community. The rebirth of cities, currently referred to as \"urban renaissance\", \"urban resurgence\" or \"urban revival\", can be also defined in terms of new urbanity regarded as an insightful and creative attitude towards the city and its culture. The elementary order of things was determined in the last decades not by the space but by the time and its acceleration and simultaneously the role of architecture alters. The course of thinking about the city is changing from a single space-time city towards a personalised city, based on individual identities and corresponding places in the physical and virtual space. That can mean a new role of the city in the creation of urbanity. In the era of advanced communication technologies, a question arises about the ontological status of the city when the emphasis is placed on independence and individuality in interactions between people. Social life becomes detached from traditional spatial patterns and practices. We are interested in the urbanity understood in the wider context of cultural urban studies which are focused on new ways of organising the communication space and social relations. We will refer in this article to the values constitutive for the city and urbanity that guided the idea of the city since the dawn of time as well as its new deconstructed forms (e.g. the pop-up city, neo-bohemia, the creative class, neighbour communities, urban guerrilla gardening, experimental urban farms, etc.). \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Dymnicka M., Badach J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/245\/4\/042058","x":2.0099999905,"y":9.1899995804},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":332,"Cited by":null,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Design and implementation of human mobility embedded system for urban planning of smart city","Abstract":"The mobility model will help us to simulate the movements of people more realistic as in real case. This paper developed human mobility system using random way point and random walk methods to model the individual movement of person in different places within area of Baghdad, Iraq. There are a lot of types of mobility model but we use Random Way Point (RWP) because it is simple, most common use and needs less memory and time for computation. The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city. Al-Sadar city is one of biggest population city in Baghdad, Iraq. It has three millions people population. We choose 5000 users moves from Al-Sadar city to two different places in Baghdad: Al- Khadmia and Al-Zawra. Al-Khadmiia is old and religion place and Al-Zawra is biggest public garden in Baghdad. In our work, we find the best ways that connect Al-Sadar city with both places. We decide the best ways depending on distances and traffic between them. It gives good method to build smart transportation and smart city using mobility and traffic models. .This paper will help urban decision maker to suggest the analytical model for urban space and have a clear picture about the city: how can it change, how do the people move in the city, what are the problems and how can solve them to generate smart city. \u00a9 2017 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

They are planning central city areas under the principles of DRR as well as BBB. There are too many laws pertaining to disaster prevention and reconstruction to refer to in full here. Therefore, this chapter focuses only on some of the new enactments after the GEJE. But attention has to be paid to their approaches to reconstruction when it comes to the question of whether they sufficiently concord with DRR and BBB (Ikuta 2013; Kaneko 2014). The Basic Act on Reconstruction in Response to the GEJE 2011 (hereinafter the Basic Act 2011) prescribes that, considering the unprecedented national crisis caused by the GEJE, the act has the purpose of promoting the smooth and prompt reconstruction and revitalization of a vibrant Japan, securing financial resources, identifying afflicted areas as Special Zones for Reconstruction with institutional and tax measures and establishing a Reconstruction Agency to undertake tasks regarding integrated national measures (Art. 1). The Basic Act 2011 then prescribes its basic philosophy, adopting the idea of the building back better concept, promoting dramatic measures for revitalization that are not limited to physical recovery of afflicted facilities, but also reconstruction measures to assist individuals to overcome the disaster and lead prosperous lives while honoring local culture and enhancing people\u2019s ties with the community (Art. 2). The Act for Special Zones for Reconstruction 2011 was enacted as separate legislation from the Basic Act 2011 to implement the reconstruction measures. Under this legislation, afflicted local governments designated as special areas can acquire significantly larger budget funds from the national government for recovery and can deregulate their spatial planning under the Agricultural Land Act, the Forest Act and the Urban Planning Act. Via this funding and deregulation, they can plan recovery-related projects for disaster prevention: the promotion of collective relocation, functional reinforcement of fishery villages, land reallocation for the revival of affected city areas, basic construction to lead city centers towards recovery from the tsunami and disaster-resistant public housing. The Act on Town Planning for Tsunami Disaster Prevention 2011 allows prefectural governments to set tsunami hazard zones and municipal governments to make integrated town plans for tsunami disaster prevention. Under the act, prefectural governments can set the presumed tsunami hazard zones and special tsunami warning zones. In the latter zone, normal town planning and building activities are restricted. \u00a9 2016 Yuka KANEKO, Katsumi MATSUOKA and Toshihisa TOYODA.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Matsuoka K.","DOI":"10.4324\/9781315680323-25","x":1.8200000525,"y":8.3299999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":357,"Cited by":null,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"5th KKU International Engineering Conference 2014, KKU-IENC 2014","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 317 papers.
