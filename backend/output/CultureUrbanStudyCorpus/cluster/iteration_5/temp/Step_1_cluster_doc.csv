20 year later , finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge .', 'Does this constitute progress ?', 'How do festival and event contribute to contemporary society ?', 'What has the remarkable rise in festival and event meant for the development of tourism destination ; for the development of economy , be they local , national or international ?', 'These and many other question preoccupy what is now an extremely large , international community of scholar from a range of discipline who adopt a variety of research approach to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebration at the heart of the diverse festival and event treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity , academic , policy and industry commentator everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in term of number , diversity and popularity has been enormous ( Getz , 1991 ; Finkel , 2009 ; Thrane , 2002 ) .', 'In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festival per year , attracting over 31 million visitor by the mid-1990s ( Janiskee , 1996 ; TIA , 2004 ) .', 'In Australia , the government notes that festival have become ubiquitous , with hundred being held every year ( Australian Government , 2012 ) .', 'In Europe , the growth has been similarly dramatic .', 'According to the International Festival and Event Association ( IFEA ) , the special event industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring event ( Wood , 2012 ) .', 'This significant growth in the practice of festival and event brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession .', 'It soon also brought a rise in academic interest : closely allied to the development of tourism study , academic began to take an interest in charting development in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 year .', 'Much of the research is published in tourism study and specific event-oriented journal , but it also finds expression in a wide range of journal dedicated to management and marketing , urban

fracture between academic discipline and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields .', 'The literature on the Olympic Games , for example , is now in and of itself very substantial , yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other event that differ by scale and type is very unclear .', 'Getz and Andersson ( 2010 ) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researcher from many perspective : impact ( of varying type ) , place marketing , travel pattern , displacement effect , motivation , market segmentation , quality and satisfaction , regional development , relationship to urban renewal and development , and link to culture and community .', 'However , this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gap are closing in some area , they continue to open up elsewhere all the time .', 'This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concept that would seem very important in term of future development .', ""The concept of ‘ risk management ' , so important from an applied perspective , and that of ‘ emerging economy ' , so important from a geographical perspective , are

is well recognised that festival and special event are important from community , social , cultural , political and economic perspective .', 'Despite the growth and popularity of festival and special event , researcher were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impact and motivation ( Gursoy et al.', ', 2004 ) .', 'However , this imbalance is now being corrected .', 'The recent evolution of the academic study of festival and event can not be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism .', 'As theme of enquiry have emerged and
