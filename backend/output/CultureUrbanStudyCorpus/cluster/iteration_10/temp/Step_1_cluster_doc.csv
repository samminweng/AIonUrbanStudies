festival and holiday event represented nouveau , alternative tourism ( cited in Lee et al.', ', 2008 ) .', 'How time have changed !', 'Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when , more than 20 year later , finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge .', 'Does this constitute progress ?', 'How do festival and event contribute to contemporary society ?', 'What has the remarkable rise in festival and event meant for the development of tourism destination ; for the development of economy , be they local , national or international ?', 'These and many other question preoccupy what is now an extremely large , international community of scholar from a range of discipline who adopt a variety of research approach to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebration at the heart of the diverse festival and event treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity , academic , policy and industry commentator everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in term of number , diversity and popularity has been enormous ( Getz , 1991 ; Finkel , 2009 ; Thrane , 2002 ) .', 'In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festival per year , attracting over 31 million visitor by the mid-1990s ( Janiskee , 1996 ; TIA , 2004 ) .', 'In Australia , the government notes that festival have become ubiquitous , with hundred being held every year ( Australian Government , 2012 ) .', 'In Europe , the growth has been similarly dramatic .', 'According to the International Festival and Event Association ( IFEA ) , the special event industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring event ( Wood , 2012 ) .', 'This significant growth in the practice of festival and event brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession .', 'It soon also brought a rise in academic interest : closely allied to the development of tourism study , academic began to take an interest in charting development in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 year .', 'Much of the research is published in tourism study and specific event-oriented journal , but it also finds expression in a wide range of journal dedicated to management and marketing , urban and place study , art and cultural policy , as well as many social sciences-oriented journal .', 'In the majority of case , festival and special event are presented as broadly positive phenomenon .', 'Throughout the literature , opening paragraphs emphasise the important role they play in advancing local and regional economy , branding place , attracting visitor , extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit .', 'Yet , festival and special event , the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial , complex and dynamic set of activity that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in country throughout the world .', 'In academia , they are studied from diverse management , social science and humanity perspective .', 'As such , interpretation of their impact and contribution to contemporary economy and society as well as approach to valuing , managing and shaping appropriate policy for their advancement are multiple and at time conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time .', 'Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge , the fracture between academic discipline and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields .', 'The literature on the Olympic Games , for example , is now in and of itself very substantial , yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other event that differ by scale and type is very unclear .', 'Getz and Andersson ( 2010 ) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researcher from many perspective : impact ( of varying type ) , place marketing , travel pattern , displacement effect , motivation , market segmentation , quality and satisfaction , regional development , relationship to urban renewal and development , and link to culture and community .', 'However , this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gap are closing in some area , they continue to open up elsewhere all the time .', 'This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concept that would seem very important in term of future development .', ""The concept of ‘ risk management ' , so important from an applied perspective , and that of ‘ emerging economy ' , so important from a geographical perspective , are two example of this.This volume is tasked with introducing , defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concept in the contemporary study of festival and event ."", 'While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of , or closely associated with , tourism study , in reality , it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline area .', 'It is well recognised that festival and special event are important from community , social , cultural , political and economic perspective .', 'Despite the growth and popularity of festival and special event , researcher were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impact and motivation ( Gursoy et al.', ', 2004 ) .', 'However , this imbalance is now being corrected .', 'The recent evolution of the academic study of festival and event can not be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism .', 'As theme of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism study , they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event study .', 'This link between the two area of study is very strong , with tourism study the primary field of enquiry and festival and event a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meaning , practice and policy associated with festival and event remains ongoing .', 'As this volume will show , the understanding of core concept remains uneven , and our knowledge of certain dimension of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others .', 'Some of the extant gap are recent , emerging only when contemporary political and societal debate begin to highlight particular concern .', 'The concept of innovation is a case in point : question as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting , adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature .', ""Others , such as the sustainability of the sector 's activity have been an issue for longer ."", 'Most recently of all , the question as to how festival and event activity are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated ,

dominant theory in urban study , it does , nevertheless , have its share of detractor , and one criticism has been its failure to take into account geographical scale .', 'While there is an acknowledgment in urban regime theory of wider economic process , such as the broad transformation in international and national trade , investment , finance , etc.', ', or the role played by federal or state government , the bias has remained mostly local , particularly in regard to urban governance .', 'In urban regime theory literature the policy and action of international and national institution either nicely conjoin with local interest or are nearly totally absent .', 'Due to this oversight , urban regime theory tends to underemphasize how the capacity to govern a city effectively is sometimes the result of the interaction of action of people at multiple scale .', 'This article attempts to address this oversight in an analysis of Glasgow , Scotland , during the
