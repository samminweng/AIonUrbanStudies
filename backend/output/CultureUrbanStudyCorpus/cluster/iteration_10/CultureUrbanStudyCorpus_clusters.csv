-1,4,303.0,1999,Article,Typhoid fever in children aged less than 5 years,"Background. Calculation of the incidence of typhoid fever during preschool years is important to define the optimum age of immunisation and the choice of vaccines for public-health programmes in developing countries. Hospital-based studies have suggested that children younger than 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever, but this view needs to be re-examined in community-based longitudinal studies. We undertook a prospective follow-up study of residents of a low-income urban area of Delhi, India, with active surveillance for case detection. Methods. A baseline census was undertaken in 1995. Between Nov 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 1996, we visited 8172 residents of 1820 households in Kalkaji, Delhi, twice weekly to detect febrile cases. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings. 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases were detected. Of these, 28 (44%) were in children aged under 5 years. The incidence rate of typhoid per 1000 person-years was 27.3 at age under 5 years, 11.7 at 5-19 years, and 1.1 between 19 and 40 years. The difference in the incidence of typhoid fever between those under 5 years and those aged 5-19 years (15.6 per 1000 person-years [95% CI 4.7-26.5]), and those aged 19-40 years (26.2 [16.0-36.3]) was significant (p < 0.001 far both). The difference between the incidence of typhoid at 5-19 years and the incidence at 19-40 years was also significant (10.6 [6.3-14.8], p < 0 001). Morbidity in those under 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and need for hospital admission. Interpretation. Our findings challenge the common view that typhoid fever is a disorder of school-age children and of adults. Typhoid is a common and significant cause of morbidity between 1 and 5 years of age. The optimum age of typhoid immunisation and the choice of vaccines needs to be reassessed.This study was conducted to measure the incidence of typhoid fever among preschoolers. It was suggested that children aged 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever. However, it is important to re-examine this view, particularly in infants and young children in the low-income urban area of Delhi, India, through active surveillance. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings revealed 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases, about 44% of which were in children under 5 years of age. Morbidity in children under age 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and the need for hospital admission. The incidence of typhoid fever and the age distribution of the case varied between developing countries. Thus, the age patterns of typhoid fever observed in the urban study area may differ in rural areas within India or in other developing countries. A reevaluation of the optimum age and vaccine of choice is needed.",,"Sinha A., Sazawal S., Kumar R., Sood S., Reddaiah V.P., Singh B., Rao M., Naficy A., Clemens J.D., Bhan M.K.",10.1016/S0140-6736(98)09001-1,17.67,0.99

An empirical survey of pupils (n = 437) and teachers in selected schools of the city and metropolitan area of Zurich investigated leisure activities in urban forests and public green spaces for their potential to facilitate social interaction between Swiss and immigrant young people. Patterns of socialising and making friends in these outdoor locations were found to differ depending on age, school level, gender and the percentage of immigrants in each residential area. Public urban green spaces were found to play an important role for children and youths in making contacts and friends across cultures, which is considered a prerequisite for social inclusion. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The use of enforcement to combat begging, street drinking and rough sleeping in England","This paper examines recent responses to 'problematic street culture' in England, where increasing pressure has been exerted to prevent people from begging and street drinking in public spaces, with rough sleeping also targeted in some areas. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with enforcement agents, support providers and targeted individuals, it assesses the extent to which the strategies employed are indicative of a 'revanchist expulsion' of the deviant Other and/or an expression of 'coercive care' for the vulnerable Other. It concludes that, whilst the recent developments appear, at first glance, to be symptomatic of revanchist sanitisation of public space, closer examination reveals that the situation is actually much more complex than a revanchist reading of the situation might suggest, and perhaps not as devoid of compassion. © 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.",,"Johnsen S., Fitzpatrick S.",10.1177/0042098009356128,17.41,1.93

This article examines the range of suburban definitions in terms of their structure and the topical issues that they grapple with. Suburbs have been defined according to many different dimensions from location and transportation modes to culture and physical appearance. Given this confusion, one approach is to abandon the term; another is to use it with greater precision. This is more than just an issue of semantics. Rather how people talk and think about suburbs shapes how they can see such areas being developed and redeveloped in the future. © The Author(s) 2012.",design; housing; land use; planning history; planning practice; urban design; urban form,Forsyth A.,10.1177/0885412212448101,17.11,0.07

Previous research and case studies suggest that the physical environment has a positive or negative role in perceptions of everyday life. It is argued that landscapes have a symbolic dimension, and aspects of landscapes can be recognized as familiar or alien, welcoming or excluding. A wide variety of case studies in Britain are used to discuss design and management practices that reflect a range of cultural experiences. The need for landscape architects and managers to be aware of how places may be interpreted in different ways by different ethnic minority groups, and to work towards inclusive design, is highlighted.",Culture; Design; Ethnic minorities; Perception; Urban parks,Rishbeth C.,10.1080/01426390120090148,14.78,0.86

Drawing principally on qualitative research findings from a study involving both adult and child researchers, our aim is to chart the diversities and commonalities of urban young people's mobility experiences in the everyday - how they use and experience the city - developing a comparative perspective across three urban study sites which links young people's mobility with the power relations that operate to shape their movements in individual locations. In particular, we consider how positive and negative images of young people's mobility play out in terms of the inter-generational frictions and negotiations generated by their mobility performances. We also reflect on the developmental implications, in terms of young people's access to services and income and their participation in the social networks and peer culture which may shape their life trajectories. Three themes are explored in detail: mobility as challenge, mobility as temptation and mobility control. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Children; Ghana; Inter-generational relations; Malawi; Mobility; South Africa; Transport; Urban; Young people,"Porter G., Hampshire K., Abane A., Robson E., Munthali A., Mashiri M., Tanle A.",10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.05.001,17.82,1.65

Since today all people are engaged in emerging collective experiments on matters as varied as climate, food, landscape, health, urban design, and technical communication as consumers, militants, and citizens, they can all be considered co-researchers. Co-researching has consequences for our understanding of nature and demands a renewed attention to ""multinaturalist"" politics.

-1,29,52.0,2011,Book,Greater Portland: Urban life and landscape in the Pacific Northwest,"It has been called one of the nation’s most livable regions, ranked among the best managed cities in America, hailed as a top spot to work, and favored as a great place to do business, enjoy the arts, pursue outdoor recreation, and make one’s home. Indeed, years of cooperative urban planning between developers and those interested in ecology and habitability have transformed Portland from a provincial western city into an exemplary American metropolis. Its thriving downtown, its strong neighborhoods, and its pioneering efforts at local management have brought a steady procession of journalists, scholars, and civic leaders to investigate the “Portland style” that values dialogue and consensus, treats politics as a civic duty, and assumes that it is possible to work toward public good. Probing behind the press clippings, acclaimed urban historian Carl Abbott examines the character of contemporary Portland-its people, politics, and public life-and the region’s history and geography in order to discover how Portland has achieved its reputation as one of the most progressive and livable cities in the United States and to determine whether typical pressures of urban growth are pushing Portland back toward the national norm. In Greater Portland, Abbott argues that the city cannot be understood without reference to its place. Its rivers, hills, and broader regional setting have shaped the economy and the cityscape. Portlanders are Oregonians, Northwesteners, Cascadians; they value their city as much for where it is as for what it is, and this powerful sense of place nurtures a distinctive civic culture. Tracing the ways in which Portlanders have talked and thought about their city, Abbott reveals the tensions between their diverse visions of the future and plans for development. Most citizens of Portland desire a balance between continuity and change, one that supports urban progress but actively monitors its effects on the region’s expansive green space and on the community’s culture. This strong civic participation in city planning and politics is what gives greater Portland its unique character, a positive setting for class integration, neighborhood revitalization, and civic values. The result, Abbott confirms, is a region whose unique initiatives remain a model of American urban planning. © 2001 University of Pennsylvania Press. All rights reserved.",,Abbott C.,,14.66,1.59

As the nation struggled to recover from a record breaking magnitude 9 earthquake and a tsunami that was as high as thirty-eight meters in some places, news trickled out that Fukushima had experienced meltdowns in three reactors. These tragic catastrophes claimed some 20,000 lives, initially displacing some 500,000 people and overwhelming Japan’s formidable disaster preparedness.This book brings together the analysis and insights of a group of distinguished experts on Japan to examine what happened, how various institutions and actors responded and what lessons can be drawn from Japan’s disaster. The contributors, many of whom experienced the disaster first hand, assess the wide–ranging repercussions of this catastrophe and how it is already reshaping Japanese culture, politics, energy policy, and urban planning. © 2012 Editorial selection and matter, Jeff Kingston.",,Kingston J.,10.4324/9780203124109,15.95,1.88

-1,45,30.0,2013,Book,"The middle class in neoliberal China: Governing risk, life-building, and themed spaces","Since the late 1970s, China's move towards neoliberalism has made it not only one of the world's fastest growing economies, but also one of the most polarised states. This economic, social and political transformation has led to the emergence of a new Chinese middle class, and understanding the development and the role of this new social group is crucial to understanding contemporary Chinese society. Investigating the new politics of the middle class in China, this book addresses three major questions. First, how does the Chinese state deal with problems of national sovereignty and political representation to create the middle class both as a legitimate category of the people and as an ideal norm of citizenship? Second, how does the recognition of the middle class norm take place in the practice of everyday life? Finally, what kind of risks does the politics of the middle class generate not only for middle class subjects but also for the disenfranchised? In answering these questions, this book examines a set of practices, bodies of knowledge, measures, and institutions that aim to manage, govern, control, and orient the behaviours, gestures, and thoughts of Chinese citizens. This investigation contributes not only to the understanding of the Chinese middle class society but also to the scholarly debate over the relationship between governmental apparatuses, subjectification, and life-building. Drawing on ethnographic information, historical archives, and the media, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars working in the fields of Chinese studies, Chinese politics, ethnic studies and urban studies, as well as those interested in culture, society, class and welfare. © 2013 Hai Ren.

-1,49,27.0,1998,Article,Intellectual of empire: Eric Dutton and hegemony in British Africa,"This essay examines the career of Eric Dutton in five British African colonies from 1919 to 1952, with case studies of his work in Lusaka and Zanzibar. In analyzing Dutton's career, I use a Gramscian conception of the role of intellectuals in creating colonial hegemony, against the backdrop of recent research on the relationship of geography to colonial discourse. Dutton worked and corresponded with key players in Britain's African empire. He was a major force behind early urban-planning programs in East and Central Africa and author of four geographical books. Permanently disabled by war wounds, he was also permanently infatuated with the moral rightness of British imperial culture. A concern for geography's professional relationship with, and the geographical legacy of, colonialism has emerged in recent scholarship on Africa, largely through studies of travel writing, fiction, and nineteenth- or early twentieth-century exploration geography. Later scholar-officials like Dutton sought to apply their knowledge to the shaping of spaces to serve the Empire's direct and immediate needs in Africa, even while trying to win the hearts and minds of its subject peoples. Around Timothy Mitchell's (1988) concept of ""enframing,"" I build an analysis of the spatial projects with which Dutton is most associated and show how Lusaka and Zanzibar were enframed by his plans. Through his publications and correspondences, as well as his seemingly omnipresent service, Dutton has an important legacy that has neither been articulated nor analyzed, one which points to the importance of contextualized biography for analyses of colonial discourse. I argue here for seeing Dutton as an intellectual in the service of colonial hegemony and its enframing spatial discourse, although the character of his agency exemplifies why that attempted hegemony failed.",Africa; Colonialism; Cultural hegemony,Myers G.A.,10.1111/1467-8306.00082,16.7,2.19
-1,52,26.0,2008,Article,Imagining Portland's urban growth boundary: Planning regulation as cultural icon,"Problem: In the 30 years since its creation, has Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation? Spirited debate about its impacts on land uses and values has inspired vivid descriptions by both supporters and critics and spurred the imagination of artists and creative writers. Purpose: The UGB has become a symbol, metaphor, and touchstone, as people read complex meanings into it that go beyond its simple legal function. This article looks at the UGB as a cultural icon. It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media.Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives. Takeaway for practice: In the world of 21st-century planning theory there is a strong assumption that many voices engaged in overlapping conversations can help shape more equitable and sustainable cities. Creative depictions of Portland's UGB show the role of cultural actors in shaping and enriching such conversations.",Culture and regulation; Oregon; Urban growth boundary (UGB); Portland,"Abbott C., Margheim J.",10.1080/01944360801944997,15.08,1.63
0,60,22.0,2020,Article,Uncovering inconspicuous places using social media check-ins and street view images,"There is a Chinese proverb, “if your wine tastes really good, you do not need to worry about the location of your bar (酒香不怕巷子深)”, which implies that the popular places for local residents are sometimes hidden behind an unassuming door or on unexpected streets. Discovering these unassuming places (e.g. restaurants) of a city will benefit the understanding of local culture and help to build livable neighborhoods. Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing. These places are potential recreational areas for all groups of people and could be improved regarding urban design and planning to make these public infrastructures more attractive. This work demonstrates how multi-source big geo-data can be combined to build comprehensive place-based representations for different groups of people. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Place semantics; Residents and visitors; Social media check-ins; Social sensing; Street view images,"Zhang F., Zu J., Hu M., Zhu D., Kang Y., Gao S., Zhang Y., Huang Z.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101478,16.12,-0.17

How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of ‘ risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of ‘ emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature.

The research found that the level of compliance with residential standards is quite low and can vary from one standard to another and from one house to another due to differences in the socio-economic characteristics among people. The findings of multiple regression analysis reveal that there is a good level of public awareness of residential standards, but this does not result in complete compliance with residential standards. Factors, such as household income per month, household size, finance facilities, municipal administration culture, monitoring, enforcement and the uncertainty of residential standards have a significant impact on the extent of compliance with planning standards. Suggestions for improved urban planning practices which address these issues are summarised in the paper and include reassessed current residential standards through comprehensive legal frameworks, linking residential standards with urban design approaches, changing planning practices, developing information systems to produce effective monitoring systems of construction processes and enforcement mechanisms, the development of local staff including planners, designers and environmental engineers, supported partnerships between private and public sectors, and the use of participatory planning and citizen involvement.

A concentration of people in the same geographic area who are of similar ethnic background, culture and language can be an important source of financial and personal support, information and guidance, and social mores. Evidence is found that, after controlling for a range of other observable and unobservable factors important to the location decision, the concentration of people of a particular ethnic group in a particular area has a significant effect on the chance that new immigrants of the same ethnic group will choose to live there. The size of the effect, however, depends on the personal characteristics of immigrants. The attraction of ethnic concentrations of immigrants is significantly smaller for new immigrants with a university degree and for those who normally speak English at home. Characteristics of the local ethnic community related to education and language profiles are also significant determinants of location choice. © 2004 by the Institute of Urban Studies All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Immigrants; Mobility; Neighborhood effects,McDonald J.T.,,16.8,-0.04
-1,78,18.0,2008,Article,"Scales, regimes, and the urban governance of Glasgow","Over the last two decades, urban regime theory has become one of the most dominant paradigms of thought in urban studies. In particular, regime theory offers a complex account of urban governance, or how local governments, the business communities, and community organizations gain the capacity to shape the policies that affect cities, that is, govern. Although regime theory is a dominant theory in urban studies, it does, nevertheless, have its share of detractors, and one criticism has been its failure to take into account geographical scale. While there is an acknowledgment in urban regime theory of wider economic processes, such as the broad transformations in international and national trade, investment, finance, etc., or the role played by federal or state governments, the bias has remained mostly local, particularly in regards to urban governance. In urban regime theory literature the policies and actions of international and national institutions either nicely conjoin with local interests or are nearly totally absent. Due to this oversight, urban regime theory tends to underemphasize how the capacity to govern a city effectively is sometimes the result of the interaction of actions of people at multiple scales. This article attempts to address this oversight in an analysis of Glasgow, Scotland, during the 1980s. By focusing on the role of the European City of Culture in the revitalization of the city, this article demonstrates how the capacity for a ruling coalition to transform the city and to govern effectively was the consequence of the policy and administrative actions undertaken at other geographical scales. © 2008 Urban Affairs Association.",,Tretter E.M.,10.1111/j.1467-9906.2007.00375.x,16.51,0.43

In this wave of revival, many groups are marginalized, the reclaimed public space is often sanitized, gentrified and fortified, and not inclusive. However, there are urban public spaces that defy or at least resist these trends. Examining urban neighbourhood main streets reveals that even though the contemporary urban street can never be an unregulated place of unconstrained diversity, there are streets that counter the prevalent culture of consumption, and one can find visible signs of spontaneity and diversity of people and activities, and genuine social life. Using research in urban sociology, a taxonomy for sociability is developed, and the existing range of classifications of outdoor social activities is expanded. Through empirical examination, this paper explains how these streets perform as social spaces—how sociability is enacted, and what is the nature of planning, design and management, which supports social behaviours. Finally, the research emphasizes the role of the street as an ordinary public space in creating affordances for everyday social contacts that are crucial to personal well-being and social cohesion. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",Main streets; Public space; Sociability; Social life; Taxonomy; Urban design,Mehta V.,10.1057/s41289-018-0069-9,16.89,0.45

The book reveals hardships the city encountered in the 1950s and the glamour enjoyed in the 1980s. It depicts the public and private developments, and especially the public housing which has sheltered millions of residents. The author identifies the architects practising in the formative years and the representatives of a rising generation after the 1980s. Suffering from land shortage and a dense environment, the urban development of Hong Kong has in the past 70 years met the changing demands of fluctuating economic activities and a rising population. Architecture on the island has been shaped by social demands, the economy and technology. The buildings have been forged by the government, clients, planners, architects, many contractors and end-users. The built environment nurtures our life and is visual evidence of the way the city has developed. Hong Kong is a key to East Asia in the Pacific Era. The book is a must-read for a thorough understanding the contemporary history and architecture of this oriental pearl. Endorsement: ""Hong Kong sets an extreme example of hyper-density living. MTR’s Kowloon Station project offered my firm the unique opportunity to contribute to a new type of fully integrated three dimensional transport mega-structure, conceived as a well-connected place for people to live, work and play.

However, Lean philosophy has not been well understood yet in the construction industry for the fact that the complexity and dynamic nature of construction projects bring up uncertainties that may be hardly handled by construction practitioners. Moreover, project-based nature of construction business makes Lean implementation even more challenging for construction people. Even though Lean efforts in construction have recently increased, there are problems with the implementation processes. It is undeniable that successful Lean implementation strongly affects project performance. Therefore, it is essential to reveal enablers and barriers in Lean implementation so that the construction industry practitioners might conduct projects more effectively and satisfy project requirements (i.e. schedule, budget, safety). This study aims to provide a set of core enablers and barriers of Lean implementation in construction projects and guide construction professionals to better satisfy project requirements. Within this context, the study proposes seven major enabler and barrier groups, namely the financial, managerial, technical, workforce, culture, government, and communication and twenty-seven components for each group. Moreover, a survey was designed and administered to Lean practitioners to rank the enablers and barriers based on importance level. Clear understanding of technical requirements in Lean practices was ranked as the most important enabler of Lean implementation whereas lack of top management support was ranked as the most important barrier in the Lean implementation. However, the average rankings were not found to be diverging indicating that selected components of enabler and barrier groups are properly chosen. The study is expected to lead Lean practitioners with creating value to customers while preventing them from experiencing waste. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayhan H.G., Demirkesen S., Jayamanne E.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/2/022002,15.77,1.33

COVID-19-induced immobility in the mobile risk society,"Since the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declared the Coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, the virus has invaded lives around the globe. The ongoing health, social and economic crisis that followed forced urban life, business, culture, community etc. into idle mode for weeks resulting from mandated immobility. What was once taken for granted as the essence of urban experience such as cultural activities, meeting friends, relatives and colleagues in public space or in professional encounters, disappeared overnight. Free movement became significantly restricted all over the world. It seemed that immobility, social and physical distancing, and isolation were the only antidote to the fast-moving virus. For many people, working from home while also schooling their children and providing social care at a distance, peak activity at maximum physical immobility became the “new normal.” A culture emerged where rules and norms of mobilities previously taken for granted were re-negotiated and re-defined. Before the crisis and despite the negative ecological side effects, mobility has been positively connotated as a signifier for progress and success. Under the Corona regime mobility turned into a life-threatening risk. The theory of reflexive modernization, risk society and the mobilities paradigm are used to discuss these contemporary shifts and transformations. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",automobility; COVID-19; crisis; mobile risk society; Networked urban mobilities; planning; reflexivity,"Freudendal-Pedersen M., Kesselring S.",10.1080/17450101.2020.1846436,17.78,1.17
1,153,5.0,2021,Article,Hybrid coordination of city organisations: The rule of people and culture in the shadow of structures,"Under far-reaching reforms, many cities have delegated core tasks previously delivered by their administrations to independent organisations that they formally own, e.g. municipal companies, or supervise, e.g. municipal trust funds. The coordination of these (as we call them) ‘domestic’ city organisations has proven challenging. Extant literature argues that such coordination is achieved through a mix of various hierarchical, market and network mechanisms. Yet it is unclear how these modes are combined. Addressing this gap, we ask: How do governance modes interact in the hybrid coordination of domestic city organisations? Analysing the case of Vienna, where 100 domestic organisations employ about 60,000 people, we find that while cultural mechanisms, rooted in the network mode, are predominant, they unfold in the shadow of latent structural mechanisms, which are associated with hierarchy and market. In the background, structural mechanisms keep cultural coordination effective, while cultural mechanisms allow structural coordination to remain (generally) hidden. This study aims to contribute to the literature on the governance of public organisations by exploring the relationship between governance modes as well as furthering urban governance studies by applying insights from studies on the coordination of public organisations to the city context. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.",(domestic) city organisations; coordination; governance; integration; Vienna,"Leixnering S., Meyer R.E., Polzer T.",10.1177/0042098020963854,16.08,1.24
1,161,5.0,2016,Conference Paper,Applying social norms to high-fidelity pedestrian and traffic simulations,"Smart cities are founded on complex interactions among architectural and urban designs, sensors, actuators and crowds of people with their devices. In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement. In order to allow for a more effective participation of humans in the simulation, our approach does not use central coordinators or coordination protocol, but rather each agent takes its own decision so to make more realistic interactions. A software architecture and initial experimental results are presented and discussed. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Robol M., Giorgini P., Busetta P.",10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580808,15.7,0.15

The factors that support this point of view are: 1) the ubiquity of the high rise and new town way of life; 2) a shared value system and culture within the new towns that is shaped by and reflected in the architecture and planning of the new towns; 3) the importance of relationships between spaces in the new towns; 4) the ability of the architecture and planning of new towns to adapt to changes within Singaporean society; 5) the acceptance, legitimacy, and identification of the high-rise way of life by Singaporeans.

1,197,2.0,2021,Article,Using decision support system to enable crowd identify neighborhood issues and its solutions for policy makers: An online experiment at kabul municipal level,"Planning a city is a systematic process that includes time, space, and groups of people who must communicate. However, due to security problems in such war-ravaged countries as Afghanistan, the traditional forms of public participation in the planning process are untenable. In particular, due to gathering space difficulties and culture issues in Afghanistan, women and religious minorities are restricted from joining male-dominated powerholders’ face-to-face meetings which are nearly always held in fixed places called masjids (religious buildings). Furthermore, conducting such discussions with human facilitation biases the generation of citizen decisions that stimulates an atmosphere of confrontation, causing another decision problem for urban policy-making institutions. Therefore, it is critical to find approaches that not only securely revolutionize participative processes but also provide meaningful and equal public consultation to support interactions among stakehold-ers to solve their shared problems together. Toward this end, we propose a joint research program, namely, crowd-based communicative and deliberative e-planning (CCDP), a blended approach, which is a mixture of using an artificial-intelligence-led technology, decision-support system called D-Agree and experimental participatory planning in Kabul, Afghanistan. For the sake of real-world implementation, Nagoya Institute of Technology (Japan) and Kabul Municipality (Afghanistan) have formed a novel developed and developing world partnership by using our proposed methodology as an emerging-deliberation mechanism to reframe public participation in urban planning processes. In the proposed program, Kabul municipality agreed to use our methodology when Kabul city needs to make a plan with people. This digital field study presents the first practical example of using online decision support systems in the context of the neighborhood functions of Gozars, which are Kabul’s social and spatial urban units. The main objective was to harness the wisdom of the crowd to innovative suggestions for helping policymakers making strategic development plans for Gozars using open call ideas, and for responding to equal participation and consultation needs, specifically for women and minorities. This article presents valuable insights into the benefits of this combined approach as blended experience for societies and cities that are suffering long-term distress.

Might it be possible to see Mumford, especially in his writings of the 1930s, as an early exemplar of green urbanism? Within environmental history, Mumford has been treated mostly as a regionalist - sometimes even as an opponent of the city. This essay argues that in fact his path toward ecological ""balance"" led directly through the city, not out of it. Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic ""renewal"" but also as a landscape full of what he called ""remnants"" and ""persistents""; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. © 2016 The Author.",,Sachs A.,10.1093/envhis/emw034,15.2,2.15

Para signifies a community or neighbourhood that share close spatial proximity and similar emotional ideology, whereas adda denotes an exchange of casual or intellectual discussions among people. Para refers to a spatial connotation with a neighbourhood, but the physical manifestation is not the only pre-requisite to form a para. Para reflects a networked social cohesion as the continuous affection concretely demonstrated in people's decisions about where to live, how to work and with whom to engage in their daily lives. Culture, ethnicity, language, food habit, mutual feelings of belongingness and robust social networking within a neighbourhood contribute to the growth of a para. Adda propagates the intensity of social networking and influence the development of para.

The social spatialization of these working class people has been manifested in compartmentalized public spaces as specific ethnic oriented “third places”, such as Filipino markets, Bangladeshi bazaar, and Pakistani neighborhood. Yet, there is no research scholarship available on the nature and type of such third places and their importance and influences on plan making process in the middle-eastern context. Certain (re-)defining themes, notably expressing and celebrating everyday culture, feeling of home being away from home, sense of places, and center places for socialization and integration emerge to brand these places as we explored empirical evidence with grounded theory centered socio-cultural lenses. Additionally, exploring spatio-temporal permeability of these third places using Space Syntax accessibility model helped us to draw critical insights about how such lessons and practices can challenge the contemporary city planning and design practices.

Drawing on over 15 years of ethnographic research, the book explores the impact of rapid urbanisation and modernisation on contemporary Thai youth, focusing on conspicuous youth subcultures, drug use (especially methamphetamine use), and violent youth gangs. Anjalee Cohen shows how young Thai people construct a specific youth identity through consumerism and symbolic boundaries – in particular through enduring rural/urban distinctions. The suggestion is that the formation of subcultures and “deviant” youth practices, such as drug use and violence, are not necessarily forms of resistance against the dominant culture, nor a pathological response to dramatic social change, as typically understood in academic and public discourse. Rather, Cohen argues that such practices are attempts to “fit in and stick out” in an anonymous urban environment.

Building on communicative theories of organizing and Luhmann’s Theory of Social Systems, we explore the communicative organizationality of a Facebook group related to urban planning. By analyzing private chat logs of the group administrators, we explore the group’s organizationality and the ways in which organizational and interactional communication become intertwined to produce and curate digital political discussions. Our findings illustrate how technological affordances built for moderation also support the strategic organization of discussions to orchestrate political talk. We conceptualize such operations as discursive conditioning of organizational interaction and suggest that political action online can be propelled not only by connecting people, but also by the powerful yet concealed tactic of conditioning public online discussions. © 2021 The Author(s).

In doing so, it situates colonial histories of urban planning and emerging African cultures of auto-mobility within a broader critique of colonial technology and infrastructure. This article argues that the realities of indirect rule—the autonomy of African urban residents and the weakness of colonial authority and infrastruc-ture—raised new questions and problems for colonial officials who were tasked with turning ideology into policy and practice. In particular, mobility politics allow us to trace the way that “average” people negotiated colonial politics within and outside of the formal, elite structures of elected Town Councils, Legislative Assembles, or chieftaincy politics. Within the colonial bureaucracy and the Town Council, African elites negotiated their own prestige and status alongside the interests and demands of the city’s lower-and middle-class populations. © 2020 by the Society for the History of Technology.

There are a lot of types of mobility model but we use Random Way Point (RWP) because it is simple, most common use and needs less memory and time for computation. The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city.

The Basic Act 2011 then prescribes its basic philosophy, adopting the idea of the building back better concept, promoting dramatic measures for revitalization that are not limited to physical recovery of afflicted facilities, but also reconstruction measures to assist individuals to overcome the disaster and lead prosperous lives while honoring local culture and enhancing people’s ties with the community (Art. 2). The Act for Special Zones for Reconstruction 2011 was enacted as separate legislation from the Basic Act 2011 to implement the reconstruction measures. Under this legislation, afflicted local governments designated as special areas can acquire significantly larger budget funds from the national government for recovery and can deregulate their spatial planning under the Agricultural Land Act, the Forest Act and the Urban Planning Act. Via this funding and deregulation, they can plan recovery-related projects for disaster prevention: the promotion of collective relocation, functional reinforcement of fishery villages, land reallocation for the revival of affected city areas, basic construction to lead city centers towards recovery from the tsunami and disaster-resistant public housing. The Act on Town Planning for Tsunami Disaster Prevention 2011 allows prefectural governments to set tsunami hazard zones and municipal governments to make integrated town plans for tsunami disaster prevention. Under the act, prefectural governments can set the presumed tsunami hazard zones and special tsunami warning zones. In the latter zone, normal town planning and building activities are restricted. © 2016 Yuka KANEKO, Katsumi MATSUOKA and Toshihisa TOYODA.",,Matsuoka K.,10.4324/9781315680323-25,15.81,1.73

Indigenous knowledge is accessible, useful and cheap. Its perspective is holistic and its transmission is verbal. Knowledge is dynamic and time-tested, and while it has grown within local natural and social environment, so it is very sustainable with indigenous condition. Indigenous knowledge refers to both component and whole part of culture of each nation and this component and whole integration is so that stop to change traditional society of life without indigenous knowledge out of its cultural origin and therefore would lose it concept and effectiveness. in recent decades following issues had been recognized very essential: programming and performing development plans, indigenous knowledge at farming, pest control, ranching, veterinary, nutrition, medicine, watershed management, foresting, architecture, urban planning, social associations and decision making method as sustainable technology. At on hand, reason of this great evolution can be found due to wrong policy and at the other hand in undesirable environmental consequences of these policies. Indigenous knowledge is different with scientific knowledge that was established by universities and scientific communities. This knowledge is basis for decision making at field of agriculture, health, education, food and natural sources Indigenous knowledge is set of all knowledge and skills that people enjoy in one geographical area (in one environmental conditions) that most of their skills and knowledge be transmitted to next generation, and new generation would be adapted with them and add to it Since, each knowledge is consequent of individual interaction with environment, so indigenous knowledge is consequent of indigenous people interaction with their environment.",Agriculture; Indigenous knowledge,"Arjmandi H., Mardani H., Nazeri M.",,16.14,2.78
