Urban studies in particular has failed to consider the overwhelming impact of the automobile in transforming the time-space 'scapes' of the modern urban\/suburban dweller. Focusing on forms of mobility into, across and through the city, we consider how the car reconfigures urban life, involving distinct ways of dwelling, travelling and socializing in, and through, an automobilized time-space. We trace urban sociology's paradoxical resistance to cultures of mobility, and argue that civil society should be reconceptualized as a 'civil society of automobility'. We then explore how automobility makes instantaneous time and the negotiation of extensive space central to how social life is configured. As people dwell in and socially interact through their cars, they become hyphenated car-drivers: at home in movement, transcending distance to complete a series of activities within fragmented moments of time. Urban social life has always entailed various mobilities but the car transforms these in a distinct combination of flexibility and coercion. Automobility is a complex amalgam of interlocking machines, social practices and ways of dwelling which have reshaped citizenship and the public sphere via the mobilization of modern civil societies. In the conclusion we trace a vision of an evolved automobility for the cities of tomorrow in which public space might again be made 'public'.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sheller M., Urry J.","DOI":"10.1111\/1468-2427.00276","x":9.8299999237,"y":5.7699999809},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":2,"Cited by":357.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The relation between perceived sensory dimensions of urban green space and stress restoration","Abstract":"Research indicates a relationship between sensory perception of natural environments and human health. Our hypothesis is that people perceive green spaces in terms of certain dimensions, where some dimensions are more important and preferred than others with respect to restoring people from stress. The aims are to: identify and describe the perceived dimensions in nature; identify which dimensions people in general prefer; identify the dimensions people reporting stress prefer; and identify a combination of the dimensions people reporting stress prefer. A total of 953 randomly selected informants from nine Swedish cities (representative of the Swedish population) answered a postal questionnaire with pre-coded questions. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: personal data, preferences for natural qualities and self-estimations of health status. The data were analyzed using factor analysis and regression analyses. The results identify and describe eight perceived sensory dimensions. People in general prefer the dimension Serene, followed by Space, Nature, Rich in Species, Refuge, Culture, Prospect and Social. The dimensions Refuge and Nature are most strongly correlated with stress, indicating a need to find the most restorative environments. A combination of Refuge, Nature and Rich in Species, and a low or no presence of Social, could be interpreted as the most restorative environment for stressed individuals. From a city planning perspective, the results indicate how urban green spaces can be viewed as elements of importance to public mental health. However, before the dimensions can be used by practitioners as tools to promote health through city planning, more research is needed. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This review paper explores the wide spectrum of human dimensions and issues, or human needs, addressed by 90 of these studies. As a basis for analysis, the major themes tapped by the findings were classified into two overarching groups containing three categories each. The Nature needs, directly linked with the physical features of the environmental setting, were categorized in terms of contact with nature, aesthetic preference, and recreation and play. The role of the environment is less immediate in the Human-interaction group, which includes the issues of social interaction, citizen participation in the design process, and community identity. Most significantly, the publications offer strong support for the important role nearby natural environments play in human well-being. Urban settings that provide nature contact are valuable not only in their own right, but also for meeting other needs in a manner unique to these more natural settings. In addition, although addressed in different ways, remarkable similarities exist concerning these six people requirements across diverse cultures and political systems. Urban residents worldwide express a desire for contact with nature and each other, attractive environments, places in which to recreate and play, privacy, a more active role in the design of their community, and a sense of community identity. The studies reviewed here offer continued evidence that the design of urban landscapes strongly influences the well-being and behavior of users and nearby inhabitants. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Calculation of the incidence of typhoid fever during preschool years is important to define the optimum age of immunisation and the choice of vaccines for public-health programmes in developing countries. Hospital-based studies have suggested that children younger than 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever, but this view needs to be re-examined in community-based longitudinal studies. We undertook a prospective follow-up study of residents of a low-income urban area of Delhi, India, with active surveillance for case detection. Methods. A baseline census was undertaken in 1995. Between Nov 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 1996, we visited 8172 residents of 1820 households in Kalkaji, Delhi, twice weekly to detect febrile cases. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings. 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases were detected. Of these, 28 (44%) were in children aged under 5 years. The incidence rate of typhoid per 1000 person-years was 27.3 at age under 5 years, 11.7 at 5-19 years, and 1.1 between 19 and 40 years. The difference in the incidence of typhoid fever between those under 5 years and those aged 5-19 years (15.6 per 1000 person-years [95% CI 4.7-26.5]), and those aged 19-40 years (26.2 [16.0-36.3]) was significant (p < 0.001 far both). The difference between the incidence of typhoid at 5-19 years and the incidence at 19-40 years was also significant (10.6 [6.3-14.8], p < 0 001). Morbidity in those under 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and need for hospital admission. Interpretation. Our findings challenge the common view that typhoid fever is a disorder of school-age children and of adults. Typhoid is a common and significant cause of morbidity between 1 and 5 years of age. The optimum age of typhoid immunisation and the choice of vaccines needs to be reassessed.This study was conducted to measure the incidence of typhoid fever among preschoolers. It was suggested that children aged 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever. However, it is important to re-examine this view, particularly in infants and young children in the low-income urban area of Delhi, India, through active surveillance. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings revealed 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases, about 44% of which were in children under 5 years of age. Morbidity in children under age 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and the need for hospital admission. The incidence of typhoid fever and the age distribution of the case varied between developing countries. Thus, the age patterns of typhoid fever observed in the urban study area may differ in rural areas within India or in other developing countries. A reevaluation of the optimum age and vaccine of choice is needed.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sinha A., Sazawal S., Kumar R., Sood S., Reddaiah V.P., Singh B., Rao M., Naficy A., Clemens J.D., Bhan M.K.","DOI":"10.1016\/S0140-6736(98)09001-1","x":7.6199998856,"y":5.5700001717},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":5,"Cited by":216.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Ten questions on the soundscapes of the built environment","Abstract":"Soundscape research represents a paradigm shift from noise control policies towards a new multidisciplinary approach as it involves not only physical measurements but also the cooperation of humanity and social sciences to account for the diversity of soundscapes across countries and cultures, with more focus on how people actually experience the acoustic environments; and it considers environmental sounds as a 'resource' rather than a 'waste'.

The TCC is conceptualized in terms of four fractions: (1) Those who own and\/or and control the major transnational corporations and their local affiliates (corporate fraction). In architecture these are the major architectural, architecture-engineering and architecture-developer-real estate firms. In comparison with the major global consumer goods, energy and financial corporations the revenues of the biggest firms in the architecture industry are quite small. However, their importance for the built environment and their cultural importance, especially in cities, far outweighs their relative lack of financial and corporate muscle. (2) Globalizing politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction). These are the politicians and bureaucrats at all levels of administrative power and responsibility who actually decide what gets built where, and how changes to the built environment are regulated. (3) Globalizing professionals (technical fraction). The members of this fraction range from the leading technicians centrally involved in the structural features of new building to those responsible for the education of students and the public in architecture. (4) Merchants and media (consumerist fraction). These are the people who are responsible for the marketing of architecture in all its manifestations. (There is obviously some overlap between the membership of these fractions.). My conclusion is that many global and aspiring global cities have looked to iconic architecture as a prime strategy of urban intervention, often in the context of rehabilitation of depressed areas. The attempt to identify the agents most responsible for this transformation, namely the TCC, and to explain how they operate, suggests that deliberately iconic architecture is becoming a global phenomenon, specifically a central urban manifestation of the culture-ideology of consumerism. \u00a9 Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sklair L.","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1468-2427.2005.00601.x","x":8.6800003052,"y":6.3800001144},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":7,"Cited by":187.0,"Year":2005,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Beyond binary choices: Integrating individual and social creativity","Abstract":"The power of the unaided individual mind is highly overrated. Although society often thinks of creative individuals as working in isolation, intelligence and creativity result in large part from interaction and collaboration with other individuals. Much human creativity is social, arising from activities that take place in a context in which interaction with other people and the artifacts that embody collective knowledge are essential contributors. This paper examines: (1) how individual and social creativity can be integrated by means of proper collaboration models and tools supporting distributed cognition; (2) how the creation of shareable externalizations (\"boundary objects\") and the adoption of evolutionary process models in the construction of meta-design environments can enhance creativity and support spontaneous design activities (\"unselfconscious cultures of design\"); and (3) how a new design competence is emerging - one that requires passage from individual creative actions to synergetic activities, from the reflective practitioner to reflective communities and from given tasks to personally meaningful activities. The paper offers examples in the context of collaborative design and art practice, including urban planning, interactive art and open source. In the effort to draw a viable path \"beyond binary choices\", the paper points out some major challenges for the next generation of socio-technical environments to further increase the integration of individual and social creativity. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

They are successful in presenting new findings about landscapes within their specialisation, but collaboration - and thus, transfer of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries - is seldom realised because a common approach that bridges the gaps between disciplines is missing. Instead, different landscape concepts exist side by side. Yet, cooperation is required to tackle the various environmental and social problems related to landscapes. This paper provides an overview of the historical development of landscape concepts originating from different cultural and scientific trends, and presents a new complex concept of landscape, which is designed to enable transdisciplinary landscape research. The transdisciplinary landscape concept is based on five dimensions of landscapes: the spatial entity, the mental entity, the temporal dimension, the nexus of nature and culture, and the systemic properties of landscapes. In contrast to other approaches, it unites dimensions that are usually the domain of individual disciplines and makes it, thus, possible to capitalise on plurality in landscape research. The concept promotes landscape as the combination of the subsystems known as the geo-, bio- and noo-sphere, and is illustrated by the people-landscape interaction model. The concept can be applied to all human-landscape-related research, but is exemplified by two studies that have investigated the relationship between landscape and second-home tourism, and landscape and farming, respectively. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These writers regard victims of popular or \"scenic\" landscape tastes (exemplified by Olmsted's Central Park) as intellectually shallow, motivated by momentary \"sensory pleasures\", and passively and anthropocentrically drawn to \"naturalistic\" environments rather than actively and biocentrically engaged with natural environments. This implicit refusal to grant sensory information and affective processing the power to catalyze and inform serious reflection is not new; neither is the attribution of popular landscape aesthetics to the elite society of a limited culture and historical period surprising, given the current preponderance of post-modernist sensibilities. However, in the often highly-charged atmosphere of local environmental planning and management arenas, both positions are needlessly polemical. More importantly, there is good evidence to suggest that both positions are founded on misconceptions about how the human mind works. In this paper, we will review work that establishes the intellectual bona fides of visual imagery, the important contributions that emotions make to cognition, and the likelihood that explanations of environmental aesthetics rooted in European enlightenment-era landscape painting are inadequate. This review suggests that frequent calls for new normative environmental aesthetics based on a cognitive understanding of ecological sustainability are likely premature. As social scientists, we suggest that attempts to impose prescribed environmental aesthetics (albeit ecologically pure environmental aesthetics) are inappropriate and may well be self-defeating. Instead, we suggest that a thorough understanding of visual and non-visual environmental aesthetics is needed, including examinations of the possibility that affect elicited by scenic encounters with preferred landscapes can lead people to form emotional attachments to the land and thereby develop a greater appreciation for sustainability goals. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Types of nature inferred by means of factor analysis were labeled arcadian, wild and penetrative nature, the last category comprising elements such as mosquitoes and rats in the barn. Factor analysis was used as well to infer images of appropriate relationship, which appeared to hinge around the concepts of mastery over nature, responsibility for nature and participation in nature, respectively. Levels of adherence to the responsibility and participation images were very high, indicative of a 'new biophilia' mainstream in Dutch culture. Landscape types were defined, roughly, as (1) landscape made by and for people; (2) park-like, arcadian landscape; (3) wild, interactive landscape and (4) landscape \"in which one may experience the greatness and forces of nature\". Strikingly, more than half of the respondents expressed preference for this last ('deep ecology') landscape type, with another third preferring the wild, interactive landscape. The highest preference of the 'greatness and forces' landscape was found among the respondents with high ascription of naturalness to the penetrative type of nature and respondents adhering to the participation-in-nature image of relationship. Preferences for landscape types as defined here should be distinguished from visual or behavioral landscape preferences. Even if people may not select landscapes of the 'greatness and forces of nature' in daily behaviors, these landscapes of wilderness and greatness do connect with human visions and desires. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Many have argued that talented people are drawn to artistic and cultural amenities, but few have examined art and culture as a production system and drawn meaningful insights for urban planning and economic development based on understanding its inner workings. Purpose: This article looks closely at the mechanisms that structure and drive the cultural economy and suggests possible avenues for cultural economic development and policymaking based on these mechanisms. I focus on the ways cultural producers obtain jobs, advance their careers, gain value for their goods and services, and interact with each other. Methods: I conducted 80 interviews with cultural producers, cultural gatekeepers, and owners and managers of entertainment venues these groups frequent. Results and conclusions: I find that not only are artistic and cultural producers densely agglomerated, but that key social mechanisms structure and inform this clustered production system. These industries depend on unique kinds of social interaction, from nightlife to gallery openings, to thrive. This is more than just fun and games, and is critical to the operation of this economic sector. Takeaway for practice: Cultural producers rely heavily on their social lives to advance their careers, obtain jobs, and generate value for their goods, so that the local arts social milieu is critical to the cultural economy. Cultural producers also tend to cross-fertilize, collaborating to create goods and services, review each other's products, and establish new careers, meaning the ability to live and work in close proximity to one another is important. Finally, a large concentration of creative people and an active cultural milieu has made New York culture a known brand. While New York is unique, the cultural life of other cities and regions can also be economic development assets. Places can strategically cultivate the social milieus that are most conducive to the production of art and culture. \u00a9 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","Author Keywords":"Art and culture; Cultural economy; Economic development; New York City","Authors":"Currid E.","DOI":"10.1080\/01944360708978526","x":7.4699997902,"y":9.029999733},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":16,"Cited by":98.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Evaluating the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating various outdoor urban environments in the hot dry city of Damascus, Syria","Abstract":"Consideration of urban microclimate and thermal comfort is an absolute neccessity in urban development, and a set of guidelines for every type of climate must be elaborated. However, to develop guidelines, thermal comfort ranges need to be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating different thermal environments in Damascus during summer and winter. A second aim was to define the lower and upper limits of the thermal comfort range for some of these indices. The study was based on comprehensive micrometeorological measurements combined with questionnaires. It was found that the thermal conditions of different outdoor environments vary considerably. In general, Old Damascus, with its deep canyons, is more comfortable in summer than modern Damascus where there is a lack of shade. Conversely, residential areas and parks in modern Damascus are more comfortable in winter due to more solar access. The neutral temperatures of both the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and the outdoor standard effective temperature (OUT_SET*) were found to be lower in summer than in winter. At 80 % acceptability, the study defined the lower comfort limit in winter to 21.0 \u00b0C and the upper limit in summer to 31.3 \u00b0C for PET. For OUT_SET*, the corresponding lower and upper limits were 27.6 \u00b0C and 31.3 \u00b0C respectively. OUT_SET* showed a better correlation with the thermal sensation votes than PET.

Singapore has undergone rapid urbanization after its independence in 1965, with a concomitant decline in natural habitat extent and accessibility. Using coastal mangrove forests as a case study habitat, changing cultural values were explored with a novel array of techniques, including qualitative archival analysis (photographs, oral histories), current sources (publically uploaded social media photographs), and surveys of (a) the general public and (b) visitors to publically accessible mangroves. Cultural value changed through time, with a significant transition from intrinsic, intrapersonal values (spiritual, cultural heritage) to instrumental, interpersonal values (recreation, education). Additionally, cultural value varied between different mangroves depending on their public accessibility, and the evolving degree of human interaction with the ecosystem as urban development occured. Cultural values change as development transitions, though mangroves still play an important cultural role in a heavily urbanized environment. \u00a9 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Author Keywords":"Coastal; Ecosystem services; Mangrove; Recreation; Singapore; Urbanization","Authors":"Thiagarajah J., Wong S.K.M., Richards D.R., Friess D.A.","DOI":"10.1007\/s13280-015-0647-7","x":9.5500001907,"y":9.1300001144},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":22,"Cited by":69.0,"Year":2009,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Bohemia as subculture; \"Bohemia\" as industry: Art, culture, and economic development","Abstract":"Artists have long been thought of as agents of revitalization, transforming warehouses and blighted neighborhoods into bohemian enclaves that become destinations for the well-heeled, simultaneously bringing redevelopment and reinvestment.

Urbanisation has multiple political, cultural, environmental and economic dimensions that profoundly influence social development and innovation. This fundamental long-term transformation will involve the realignment of urban society\u2019s technologies and infrastructures, culture and lifestyles, as well as governance and institutional frameworks. Such structural systemic realignments can be referred to as urban sustainability transitions: fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent societal challenges are addressed, such as shifts towards urban farming, renewable decentralised energy systems, and social economies. This book provides new insights into how sustainability transitions unfold in different types of cities across the world and explores possible strategies for governing urban transitions, emphasising the co-evolution of material and institutional transformations in socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. With case studies of mega-cities such as Seoul, Tokyo, New York and Adelaide, medium-sized cities such as Copenhagen, Cape Town and Portland, and nonmetropolitan cities such as Freiburg, Ghent and Brighton, the book provides an opportunity to reflect upon the comparability and transferability of theoretical\/conceptual constructs and governance approaches across geographical contexts.

The article looks at how specific cultural quarters are developed in city centre areas, focusing on an area of Manchester known as the Northern Quarter, and outlines the ways in which urban design techniques are used as part of the process of wider cultural regeneration.

In burgeoning poor urban settlements growing on city margins, autonomous adaptation strategies are often the only measures to respond to increasing climatic and compounding stressors. Yet, in both research and practice there remains lack of understanding regarding the dynamics of adaptation and risk reduction at the level of the community. In this paper, we argue urban slums are ideal places to consider adaptation because they offer examples of more extreme social-ecological stress than one finds in more established communities - the kind we can anticipate more broadly in the face of climate change. A framework for identifying local adaptation processes is presented and applied to analyse the case of Mathare Valley Slums in Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated suburb, where residents are regularly exposed to flooding from heavy rainfall. Findings reveal that slums, often viewed as illegitimate, makeshift, and temporary settlements, are places experienced by many residents as permanent communities characterised by rapid environmental change. Processes of adaptation in Mathare have become institutionalised through time, as a new generation of people imagine themselves staying and (re)organise to achieve a higher level of functioning through various strategies to reduce risk. Innovative and revitalising adaptation occurs as residents shift from employing more generic and expected coping strategies, such as evacuating homes or economic diversification, to creating \"gated\" communities and savings schemes to maintain and improve the settlement, despite uncertain tenure. Both formal and informal institutions, such as youth groups, play an important role in governing such heterogeneous localities, incrementally upgrading the slum and providing critical public services. Long-term residents' increasing recognition of the permanence of the slum community and its stressful conditions appears to lead to more collective action toward adaptation pathways. However, this is in marked contrast to the dominant non-local perspective of Mathare's status as both impermanent and illegal, which prevails among government officials. As such, strategies are generally not incorporated into planned interventions. While progressive policies designed to reduce risk exist, they remain nascent in their establishment and fail to benefit slumdwellers. The case illustrates the need to incorporate the wealth of knowledge, techniques, and experience extant at the community level in the development of adaptation planning. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Autonomous adaptation; Climate change; Flooding; Mathare valley slums; Urban slums; Urbanisation","Authors":"Thorn J., Thornton T.F., Helfgott A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.gloenvcha.2014.12.009","x":7.1199998856,"y":5.7600002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":26,"Cited by":60.0,"Year":1994,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Reading landscape meanings: State constructions and lived experiences in Singapore's Chinatown","Abstract":"The term 'landscape\" embodies multiple levels of meaning: it articulates the ideological intent of the powerful who plan or shape the landscape in particular ways and at the same time reflects the everyday meanings implicit in the daily routines of ordinary people associated with the landscape. Through an analysis of four themes constituting the landscape of Singapore's Chinatown, we unpack two different but interdependent versions of landscape reality: the construction of social meanings from the state's perspective and those derived from the lived experiences of Chinatown's inhabitants. In our first theme, we explore the multiplicity of meanings invested in Chinatown's housing landscape. For the state, urban renewal and public housing schemes in Chinatown represent the redrawing of landscapes along modernist lines informed by efficiency and rationality of land use, in tandem with the larger goals of nation-building. Among residents, however, the vision of modern living in everyday life was only a reality for a few; others experience the landscape in more contradictory ways. Second, in the landscape of community building, we show that state-initiated efforts at inculcating a sense of community have replaced the old spontaneous, interpersonal ties and the strength of organised vernacular associations. Inadvertently, these state strategies have in some ways actually been damaging and deleterious to community ties. In our third theme, we show how the state has, to a large extent, successfully rewritten the socially and physically polluted landscapes of Chinatown. Yet, there are examples of resistances where the state's vision of an unpolluted landscape has been punctured. Since the mid-1980s, a fourth imperative has emerged in the state's management of the Chinatown landscape in the form of attempts to conserve the landscape as a \"historic district\", a repository of the nation's tradition, history and culture. We show that there are different interpretations of the state's effort to revitalise Chinese culture in the conserved landscape and its attempt to cast Chinatown in the role of a \"common bond place\" for all Singaporeans. Singapore's Chinatown is thus a multicoded landscape inscribed with a multiplicity of meanings. It is neither used entirely as an ideological tool for manipulative ends nor does it fully embody the authenticity of daily experiences. \u00a9 1994.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Yeoh B.S.A., Kong L.","DOI":"10.1016\/0197-3975(94)90015-9","x":9.2899999619,"y":9.2299995422},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":27,"Cited by":55.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Moving young lives: Mobility, immobility and inter-generational tensions in urban Africa","Abstract":"This paper explores young people's experiences and perceptions of mobility and mobility constraints in poorer urban areas of Ghana, Malawi and South Africa within the specific context of inter-generational relations.

Indeed, years of cooperative urban planning between developers and those interested in ecology and habitability have transformed Portland from a provincial western city into an exemplary American metropolis. Its thriving downtown, its strong neighborhoods, and its pioneering efforts at local management have brought a steady procession of journalists, scholars, and civic leaders to investigate the \u201cPortland style\u201d that values dialogue and consensus, treats politics as a civic duty, and assumes that it is possible to work toward public good. Probing behind the press clippings, acclaimed urban historian Carl Abbott examines the character of contemporary Portland-its people, politics, and public life-and the region\u2019s history and geography in order to discover how Portland has achieved its reputation as one of the most progressive and livable cities in the United States and to determine whether typical pressures of urban growth are pushing Portland back toward the national norm. In Greater Portland, Abbott argues that the city cannot be understood without reference to its place. Its rivers, hills, and broader regional setting have shaped the economy and the cityscape. Portlanders are Oregonians, Northwesteners, Cascadians; they value their city as much for where it is as for what it is, and this powerful sense of place nurtures a distinctive civic culture. Tracing the ways in which Portlanders have talked and thought about their city, Abbott reveals the tensions between their diverse visions of the future and plans for development. Most citizens of Portland desire a balance between continuity and change, one that supports urban progress but actively monitors its effects on the region\u2019s expansive green space and on the community\u2019s culture. This strong civic participation in city planning and politics is what gives greater Portland its unique character, a positive setting for class integration, neighborhood revitalization, and civic values. The result, Abbott confirms, is a region whose unique initiatives remain a model of American urban planning. \u00a9 2001 University of Pennsylvania Press.

Derelict waterfronts and ageing neighbourhoods have been given new life, enjoying their reincarnation as landscapes of economy and leisure. A prevalent theme in Singapore's transformation has been the reclamation of landscapes to cater to new users, activities and agendas. Adopting a case study of the Singapore River waterfront, this paper analyses three forms of urban reclamation. They include reclaiming functionality, aimed at infusing the waterfront with new land uses; reclaiming access, as a way of opening up the landscape to more people; and reclaiming the local, as a way to commemorate local cultures and histories. While government planners and private enterprise are intent on developing a world-class environment, Singaporeans and visitors respond to this urban vision in different ways with some praising the dynamism of worldly transformations and others criticising them as a prelude to a soulless city. While some degree of worldliness is essential in any redevelopment, a fine balance has to be sought between the excesses of global urbanism and the parochialism of vernacular concerns. \u00a9 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Chang T.C., Huang S.","DOI":"10.1177\/0042098010382677","x":9.2899999619,"y":9.1999998093},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":32,"Cited by":46.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Natural disaster and nuclear crisis in Japan: Response and recovery after Japan\u2019s 3\/11","Abstract":"The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan plunged the country into a state of crisis.

In this context, cities can be regarded complex entities driven by material and energy flows that entail consumption of resources and production of waste materials in the pursuit of economic welfare and social progress. According to a sustainability perspective, environmental, social and economic indicators must also be integrated into urban planning processes. However, methodological advances regarding the definition and development of sustainable cities are required since a consensus of indicators, weighting and data management is still lacking. In this paper, a multi-criteria approach that combines three methodologies: Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed and applied to a sample of 26 representative Spanish cities with different characteristics (i.e., population, location, demands, economy, topography and culture). The combined approach allows identifying the non-sustainable cities considering an offset of indicators from the three pillars of sustainability. With this purpose, the mentioned items are implemented in a DEA model of efficiency, being the inefficient cities with an efficiency score lower than 100% defined as non-sustainable ones. Finally, this multi-criteria method allows setting the target values for the assessed indicators (benchmarked values), which become objectives for the non-sustainable cities to evolve toward a more sustainable performance. The outcomes from the analysis have identified six cities that ranked worse, with efficiency scores ranging from 57.9% to 85.8%. According to the targets of socio-economic indicators, attention should be paid to AROPE rate (people at risk of poverty and social exclusion), unemployment rate and number of crimes, meanwhile lower levels of electricity consumption, municipal solid waste and on-site greenhouse gases emissions are desirable from an environmental perspective. These outcomes are of potential interest for politicians, governments and inhabitants to aid in the identification of the metabolic flows and social\/economic indicators to be optimized in search of sustainability. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Data envelopment analysis; Life cycle assessment; Material flow analysis; Multi-criteria tool; Urban metabolism","Authors":"Gonzalez-Garcia S., Manteiga R., Moreira M.T., Feijoo G.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jclepro.2018.01.056","x":10.6999998093,"y":6.4899997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":37,"Cited by":39.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Development and implementation of Mobility-as-a-Service \u2013 A qualitative study of barriers and enabling factors","Abstract":"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has been argued as part of the solution to prevalent transport problems. However, progress from pilots to large-scale implementation has hitherto been slow. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to empirically and in-depth investigate how, and to what extent, different factors affect the development and implementation of MaaS. A framework was developed, with a basis in institutional theory and the postulation that formal as well informal factors on different analytical levels (macro, meso and micro) must be considered. The research was organised as a multiple case study in Finland and Sweden and a qualitative approach was chosen for data collection and analysis. A number of factors with a claimed impact on the development and implementation of MaaS was revealed. At the macro level, these factors included legislation concerning transport, innovation and public administration, and the presence (or not) of a shared vision for MaaS. At the meso level, (the lack of) appropriate business models, cultures of collaboration, and assumed roles and responsibilities within the MaaS ecosystem were identified as significant factors. At the micro level, people's attitudes and habits were recognised as important factors to be considered. However, how the \u2018S\u2019 in MaaS fits (or not) the transport needs of the individual\/household appears to play a more important role in adoption or rejection of MaaS than what has often been acknowledged in previous papers on MaaS. The findings presented in this paper provide several implications for public and private sector actors. Law-making authorities can facilitate MaaS developments by adjusting relevant regulations and policies such as transport-related subsidies, taxation policies and the definition of public transport. Regional and local authorities could additionally contribute to creating conducive conditions for MaaS by, for example, planning urban designs and transport infrastructures to support service-based travelling. Moreover, private actors have key roles to play in future MaaS developments, as both public and private transport services are needed if MaaS is to become a viable alternative to privately owned cars. Thus, the advance of MaaS business models that benefit all involved actors is vital for the prosperity of the emerging MaaS ecosystem. \u00a9 2019 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Barriers; Enablers; Formal institutions; Informal institutions; MaaS; Mobility-as-a-Service","Authors":"Karlsson I.C.M., Mukhtar-Landgren D., Smith G., Koglin T., Kronsell A., Lund E., Sarasini S., Sochor J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.tra.2019.09.028","x":10.2299995422,"y":5.8299999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":38,"Cited by":38.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Slum upgrading and inclusive municipal governance in Harare, Zimbabwe: New perspectives for the urban poor","Abstract":"The story of the urban poor in Harare and Zimbabwean cities in general is a story of evictions, fear and misery.

The purpose of the paper is to present how the Harare Slum Upgrading Programme is creating and strengthening municipal and community partnerships to tackle city challenges in an inclusive manner. This research indicates the housing struggles of the urban poor and the emerging City-community engagement in urban services provision (water, sanitation, tenure security and roads) and changing municipal attitudes towards the urban poor. In particular, the article presents participatory urban planning and development, slum upgrading institutional structure, profiling and enumeration, and slum upgrading impacts (resilience of the urban poor, living in slums without fear, expansive pool of beneficiaries, review of planning regulations and land ownership) as major issues promoting inclusive municipal governance. Inclusivity is implemented through incremental development, which is allowing people to settle on land first and access municipal services gradually over time. Two main factors explain such positive steps towards inclusive governance in Harare. First are indications of gradual institutional change in which the City of Harare's governance culture is changing through 'opening up' and embracing the urban poor. Second, over the years, the urban poor have built a strong and vibrant alliance which is acting as a medium of participation in City governance. The paper concludes that slum upgrading sustainability at city-wide level requires active City participation and institutionalisation as opposed to a project based approach. Lastly, addressing concerns of the urban poor is susceptible to political contestations, requiring strong impartiality to counter such forces. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Citizen participation; Gradual institutional change; Harare; Housing; Inclusive municipal governance; Slum upgrading; Urban poor; Urban services; Zimbabwe","Authors":"Muchadenyika D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2015.03.003","x":7.0900001526,"y":5.75},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":39,"Cited by":38.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Brain culture: Shaping policy through neuroscience","Abstract":"This unique book offers a timely analysis of the impact of rapidly advancing knowledge about the brain, mind and behaviour on contemporary public policy and practice.

Urban green spaces have particular value because they offer the benefits of cultural services to those living in urban areas. This study analyzed perceptions of cultural ecosystem services in the urban context of Gwacheon, Republic of Korea. We analyzed the cultural services provided by green space by surveying 240 residents of Gwacheon about which green spaces they frequently visit and what their major activities are in these green spaces, in order to find out how green spaces are utilized by urban residents. Since forests and large parks in Gwacheon are easily accessible from downtown areas because of the city structure, they play major roles in providing cultural ecosystem services. This study suggests that people find diverse cultural value in their everyday surroundings, not just in spaces with excellent ecosystems.

This paper presents the case of the Singapore River development zone as a \"hyper-symbol\" of Singapore's global urbanism. By creating a world-class riverfront not unlike the acclaimed waterfronts of London, Sydney, or San Francisco, Singapore's urban planners hope to project the city as a venue worthy of world-class tourism and leisure activities, an important node in international circuits of capital, and a vibrant city for both foreign visitors and local residents. Our paper, however, also argues that local forces and influences play a significant role in the waterfront's development. The Singapore River landscape is the negotiated outcome of both globalism and localism\u2014a dialectical landscape formed by dominant global influences on the one hand, and emerging local processes on the other. Fieldwork comprising a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews, and on-site observations provide evidence of such global-local interactions. The paper contends that the challenges at the river are symptomatic of the broader Singapore experience as the city-state grapples with issues of national identity, local empowerment, and community rights in the midst of a global convergence of tourists, capital, people, and cultures. \u00a9 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Chang T.C., Huang S., Savage V.R.","DOI":"10.2747\/0272-3638.25.5.413","x":9.3199996948,"y":9.1700000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":45,"Cited by":30.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"The middle class in neoliberal China: Governing risk, life-building, and themed spaces","Abstract":"Since the late 1970s, China's move towards neoliberalism has made it not only one of the world's fastest growing economies, but also one of the most polarised states. This economic, social and political transformation has led to the emergence of a new Chinese middle class, and understanding the development and the role of this new social group is crucial to understanding contemporary Chinese society. Investigating the new politics of the middle class in China, this book addresses three major questions. First, how does the Chinese state deal with problems of national sovereignty and political representation to create the middle class both as a legitimate category of the people and as an ideal norm of citizenship? Second, how does the recognition of the middle class norm take place in the practice of everyday life? Finally, what kind of risks does the politics of the middle class generate not only for middle class subjects but also for the disenfranchised? In answering these questions, this book examines a set of practices, bodies of knowledge, measures, and institutions that aim to manage, govern, control, and orient the behaviours, gestures, and thoughts of Chinese citizens. This investigation contributes not only to the understanding of the Chinese middle class society but also to the scholarly debate over the relationship between governmental apparatuses, subjectification, and life-building. Drawing on ethnographic information, historical archives, and the media, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars working in the fields of Chinese studies, Chinese politics, ethnic studies and urban studies, as well as those interested in culture, society, class and welfare. \u00a9 2013 Hai Ren.

There were no systematic differences between community responses in Sapporo and Kumamoto, which have the same culture. People living in detached houses in Gothenburg were more annoyed by the same road traffic noise than the people living in Japanese cities. There were no systematic differences among the three cities with regard to activity disturbances indoors, but significant disturbance of activities and resting in gardens or on balconies was noted in Gothenburg. The difference in activity disturbance was due to the differences between lifestyles in the two countries.

The focus on culture and history as factors in regional transformation has been particularly extensive in response not only to competitiveness among cities but also to sustainability requirements in the cultural sector. In the same perspective of this approach, culture in its broadest sense assumes a decisive role in constructing a system of interventions where employment and social and sustainable development become the product of the integration of places, people, economies and traditions. Creative cities are currently working on how to improve the interaction between regeneration building, economic development and social renewal in order to achieve more comprehensive development of the city. Existing creative cities may be seen to revolve around the design, promotion and activation of urban areas established due to their particular local characteristics. Such areas become creative clusters as a result of economic and structural innovations, related to the realization of innovator projects achieved with the help of local development strategies based on the economies of excellence, culture and territorial quality. Starting from such premises, this article aims to show the main factors which condition creativity in cities - such as new policies, participation, history, place identity, cultural resources and sustainability - and an emblematic case study of creative regeneration. This concerns the HafenCity district in Hamburg, where the history has assumed an important role in re-constructing the maritime identity and for many choices of urban nature. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"attractivity; creative urban regeneration; cultural resources; economic development; innovation; participation; place identity; social renewal; sustainability; urban history","Authors":"Sepe M.","DOI":"10.1080\/02665433.2013.774539","x":7.8600001335,"y":9.1400003433},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":49,"Cited by":27.0,"Year":1998,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Intellectual of empire: Eric Dutton and hegemony in British Africa","Abstract":"This essay examines the career of Eric Dutton in five British African colonies from 1919 to 1952, with case studies of his work in Lusaka and Zanzibar. In analyzing Dutton's career, I use a Gramscian conception of the role of intellectuals in creating colonial hegemony, against the backdrop of recent research on the relationship of geography to colonial discourse. Dutton worked and corresponded with key players in Britain's African empire. He was a major force behind early urban-planning programs in East and Central Africa and author of four geographical books. Permanently disabled by war wounds, he was also permanently infatuated with the moral rightness of British imperial culture. A concern for geography's professional relationship with, and the geographical legacy of, colonialism has emerged in recent scholarship on Africa, largely through studies of travel writing, fiction, and nineteenth- or early twentieth-century exploration geography. Later scholar-officials like Dutton sought to apply their knowledge to the shaping of spaces to serve the Empire's direct and immediate needs in Africa, even while trying to win the hearts and minds of its subject peoples. Around Timothy Mitchell's (1988) concept of \"enframing,\" I build an analysis of the spatial projects with which Dutton is most associated and show how Lusaka and Zanzibar were enframed by his plans. Through his publications and correspondences, as well as his seemingly omnipresent service, Dutton has an important legacy that has neither been articulated nor analyzed, one which points to the importance of contextualized biography for analyses of colonial discourse. I argue here for seeing Dutton as an intellectual in the service of colonial hegemony and its enframing spatial discourse, although the character of his agency exemplifies why that attempted hegemony failed.","Author Keywords":"Africa; Colonialism; Cultural hegemony","Authors":"Myers G.A.","DOI":"10.1111\/1467-8306.00082","x":6.8400001526,"y":5.5300002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":50,"Cited by":27.0,"Year":1989,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Space, culture and urban design in late modernism and after","Abstract":"Among the questions underlying recent debates about the architecture of the city, two are perhaps more fundamental. The first concerns the legitimacy of architectural practice: can we be assertive about how we should design our cities without seeking to enforce social assumptions which are ultimately authoritarian? The second concerns architectural theory itself: can we be specific about what architecture does without being reductive about what society is? This article identifies and criticizes two kinds of recent responses to these questions: the first is to defend an architecture of localism and containment in some new and some old ways; the second is to retreat into relativism, sometimes supported by the assertion that architecture is of limited consequence because society is increasingly independent of space. The article defends the view that we can and must be assertive about the architecture of cities in global rather than local terms. The experience of genuinely urban environments is about meeting, though not necessarily interacting with, other people, mostly unknown, who can be of recognizably different class, status, race or ethnic origin; it is also about exploring the strange, and becoming aware of, though not necessarily participating in, other ways of life. -from Author","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Peponis J.","DOI":null,"x":9.0399999619,"y":6.7100000381},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":51,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Wildfire risk, biodiversity and peri-urban planning in the Mt Lofty Ranges, South Australia","Abstract":"Major fires on the periphery of Australian cities are reframing perceptions of what constitutes effective landscape planning and vegetation management. The emerging governance challenge to simultaneously mitigate wildfire risk and support improved conservation practices is reviewed in the context of pre-colonial and modern cultures within the peri-urban Mediterranean climatic region of South Australia's Mt Lofty Ranges. The analysis suggests that anthropogenic burning of landscape has been a vital historical component of risk management. During the early modern era however, improved capacities to manage wildfire risk led to complacency in light of the hazard, which in turn has led to urbanization that has not sufficiently accounted for the levels of risk. A planning conflict is emerging within the wooded uplands as there is renewed interest in wildfire risk, which is reflected in new state policies providing greater allowances for land owners to clear vegetation around dwellings. Although attempts have been made to constrain urban growth around the city of Adelaide, recent workshops with key environmental management stakeholders suggest that urbanization continues within the Mt Lofty Ranges in areas that are both highly vulnerable to fire and of great importance for biodiversity conservation, such that planning is not reflecting the cultures of risk or biodiversity value. For such risks and values to be taken into account within reflexive systems of governance, the narratives on opportunities for adaptation generated by the people who facilitate vegetation management must be accommodated into deliberations on policy. The identification and planning of particularly vulnerable and valuable spaces within the broader landscape and cultural contexts of risk and value would enable complex, targeted responses to environmental hazards, conservation and development needs in the peri-urban uplands. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Biodiversity conservation; Peri-urban; Planning; Reflexivity; Risk; South Australia; Urban development; Wildfire","Authors":"Bardsley D.K., Weber D., Robinson G.M., Moskwa E., Bardsley A.M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apgeog.2015.06.012","x":6.9699997902,"y":7.1799998283},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":52,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Imagining Portland's urban growth boundary: Planning regulation as cultural icon","Abstract":"Problem: In the 30 years since its creation, has Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation? Spirited debate about its impacts on land uses and values has inspired vivid descriptions by both supporters and critics and spurred the imagination of artists and creative writers. Purpose: The UGB has become a symbol, metaphor, and touchstone, as people read complex meanings into it that go beyond its simple legal function. This article looks at the UGB as a cultural icon. It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media.Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives. Takeaway for practice: In the world of 21st-century planning theory there is a strong assumption that many voices engaged in overlapping conversations can help shape more equitable and sustainable cities. Creative depictions of Portland's UGB show the role of cultural actors in shaping and enriching such conversations.","Author Keywords":"Culture and regulation; Oregon; Urban growth boundary (UGB); Portland","Authors":"Abbott C., Margheim J.","DOI":"10.1080\/01944360801944997","x":7.5999999046,"y":6.9600000381},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":53,"Cited by":25.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Preferences and emotion perceptions of ornamental plant species for green space designing among urban park users in Iran","Abstract":"The main objective of the present study was to explore preferences and eumotion perceptions of people in Rasht and Ardabil (Iran) to some ornamental plants in order to help designing appropriate urban green landscapes. The study surveyed urban park users in the two cities in 2017 to identify and compare the most important factors underpinning the viability of public open spaces from the perspective of users (mental aspect) and the extent to which these mental factors match the visual features of the selected spaces (visual aspect). A random sample of 232 individuals was taken from students in Ardabil (119 persons) and Rasht (113 persons). A considerable part of the participants (37.2%) reported a feeling of tranquility when they saw flowers, while 28.8% of the participants reported a feeling of love. Flower-bearing plant species were more appealing to the participants than leafy ornamental plants. Red was the most preferred flower color (52.1%) followed by violet (18.6%) and orange (11.4%) among the ornamental species commonly used in the design of green spaces, while tulip (Tulipa gesneriana) (29%), rose (Rosa hybrida) (25%), and Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) (19%) were in the first top ranks of preferences, respectively. Coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides) and garden croton (Codiaeum variegatum) were also reported among preferred species.

Through community organizing, they have formed coalitions with people of different national and ethnic backgrounds and other people of color, tackled local concerns, and created new routes for empowerment. The character of Dominican-American politics has changed since the first large wave of Dominican immigrants arrived in New York in the 1960s. Aparicio shows how second-generation activists, raised and educated in public institutions in the city, have expanded their network to include fellow Dominicans-both in the United States and abroad--as well as other ethnic and racial minorities, such as Puerto Ricans and African-Americans, who share common goals. Offering the perspectives of local organizers and members of Dominican-American organizations, Aparicio documents their thoughts on such issues as education, police brutality, civic participation, and politics. She also explores the ways in which they experience, reflect upon, and organize around issues of race and racialization processes, and how their experiences influence their political agendas and actions.

Currently, major urban public transit systems are under construction. This paper looks at Souq Waqif station and its surrounding neighbourhood as one of the new transit hubs of Qatar. The district is located in the core of Doha and plays a significant role in the social, economic and particularly culture, as a way of life, of the people in Qatar. Within the context of Doha, there is an urge to implement transit villages, also defined as transit-oriented developments (TODs), in most of the existing centres along the rail network. A TOD is a mixed use commercial and residential area designed to maximise access to public transport and to encourage transit ridership. Therefore, it is critical to understand the benefits and impacts that TODs would invite in this context before investing large funds in developing them. The research empirically investigates the level at which transit villages can be implemented and also formed within the built environment of Doha. It is argued that this strategy and vision would encourage sustainable development by supporting better transport integration and land use. The aim is to assess and promote sustainable developments integration in the city of Doha through controlling increasing traffic and planning for transit villages. In order to develop a strategy for intervention, the existing TOD case study of Yeerongpilly in Australia was analysed, followed by the exploration of the conditions of the existing Souq Waqif area. The assessment of the Souq Waqif allowed judgments of the existing development to be made, which in turn leads to the draft of potential recommendations and suggestions for the formation and implementation of transit villages in Doha. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"built environment; Doha Metro; TODs; urban fabric","Authors":"Zaina S., Zaina S., Furlan R.","DOI":"10.1080\/07293682.2016.1259245","x":10.4099998474,"y":5.9699997902},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":56,"Cited by":24.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"'China's leading historical and cultural city': Branding Dali City through public-private partnerships in Bai architecture revitalization","Abstract":"Competing with other Chinese cities for investment and tourism, various governmental bodies with jurisdiction in Dali City have begun to make use of local historical and cultural assets in order to brand the city.

Findings - Singapore is chosen as a case study of analysis for a knowledge-based economy in transition because of its developmental approach and strategic shift from one focused on technology-intensive sectors to one focused on high knowledge-intensive companies and towards a free-spirited dynamic creative hub in the making. It displays many characteristics typical of a knowledge-based economy in which people, their ideas and capabilities are the key sources of wealth and opportunities. Practical implications - The paper observes a missing link in the transition from technology to knowledge to culture hub, which might have implications for Singapore's effort towards establishing itself as a cultural industries metropolis, a renaissance city using culture to re-position its international image as a global city for the arts.

Discovering these unassuming places (e.g. restaurants) of a city will benefit the understanding of local culture and help to build livable neighborhoods. Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing. These places are potential recreational areas for all groups of people and could be improved regarding urban design and planning to make these public infrastructures more attractive. This work demonstrates how multi-source big geo-data can be combined to build comprehensive place-based representations for different groups of people. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Place semantics; Residents and visitors; Social media check-ins; Social sensing; Street view images","Authors":"Zhang F., Zu J., Hu M., Zhu D., Kang Y., Gao S., Zhang Y., Huang Z.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101478","x":9.0699996948,"y":8.0},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":61,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Key concepts in event management","Abstract":"In recent years we have seen an enormous growth of festivals and event activity and the literature within the field is consequently huge.

These people are too many to mention by name, but I owe all of them a debt of gratitude. While writing this book I was very fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of colleagues, particularly Lucy Horan and Ruth Craggs, as well as the support and encouragement of my other colleagues at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Finally, a huge thank you to John, Muireann and Aoife for absolutely everything.IntroductionIn 1991, Getz wrote that festivals and holiday events represented nouveau, alternative tourism (cited in Lee et al., 2008). How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of \u2018 risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of \u2018 emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature. Others, such as the sustainability of the sector's activities have been an issue for longer. Most recently of all, the question as to how festival and event activities are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated, in response to the harsh realities negatively affecting the health of the sector in very recent times. The 35 concepts that are discussed in this volume are laid out in alphabetical order. \u00a9 Bernadette Quinn 2013.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Quinn B.","DOI":"10.4135\/9781473914742","x":8.220000267,"y":8.9200000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":62,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Property rights and landscape planning in the intermountain west: The Teton Valley case","Abstract":"Non-participation in landscape planning presents a formidable challenge to sustainable development. We hypothesize that even when people hold negative attitudes toward unplanned development, natural property rights values (favorable evaluations of property as an inviolable and pre-political right) prevent them from acting on their concerns. We chose an intermountain west community as a case study to evaluate our hypothesis regarding natural property rights values. All groups were equally and strongly opposed to continuation of rapid unplanned growth, but those with natural property rights values were also adamantly opposed to land use planning. We used a multiple logistic regression model to evaluate the relationship between support for landscape planning and a natural property rights values. An overall significance test of the regression equation indicated the independent variables were significantly predictive of the dependent variable (\u03c72 128, 8 d.f., p &lt; 0.001) and had high (88.7%) predictive capacity. Natural property rights value was the most important predictor variable, but income was also significant. Sustainable landscape planning requires uncoupling property rights from inviolable and pre-political natural rights. Our results suggest a conversation focused on themes associated with loss of local culture, hypocrisy of building practices, and market control over development could facilitate the aforementioned uncoupling and development planning that promotes both security for land owners and public welfare. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These 'stonewall' trees denoting synergy between nature (trees) and culture (masonry) are worth preserving. This study aims to identify factors influencing public attitude toward this important but threatened natural-cum-cultural asset in a compact city milieu. Evidence is solicited from a face-to-face questionnaire survey involving 800 citizens of Hong Kong. Results indicate that Hong Kong people generally appreciate the existence of stonewall trees. Younger adults harbored doubts about their value, whereas the older ones were more sympathetic. Local residents of the suburbs that host the majority of stonewall trees registered stronger commitment than non-local residents. Community attachment had positive effects across both resident groups, but length of tenure was not a key factor. This suggests that affinity for stonewall trees is a function of the affective bonding between people and the community where they live. Deep engagement with the local community elevated the desire for preserving the walls and associated trees. The findings are important for understanding public perception and enlisting support from the larger society for preserving the urban asset against mounting pressures for urban development and renewal. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Compact city; Place attachment; Public perception; Stone-retaining walls; Urban nature conservation; Urban trees","Authors":"Lo A.Y., Jim C.Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2014.09.006","x":10.0200004578,"y":8.7600002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":64,"Cited by":21.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Population and climate change.","Abstract":"To review, the four broad dimensions of any complex human problem, including climate change, are the human population, economics, culture, and environment. These dimensions interact with one another in all directions and on many time-scales. From 2010 to 2050, the human population is likely to grow bigger, more slowly, older, and more urban. It is projected that by 2050 more than 2.6 billion people (almost 94% of global urban growth) will be added to the urban population in today's developing countries. That works out to 1.26 million additional urban people in today's developing countries every week from 2010 to 2050. Humans alter the climate by emitting greenhouse gases, by altering planetary albedo, and by altering atmospheric components. Between 1900 and 2000, humans' emissions of carbon into the atmosphere increased fifteenfold, while the numbers of people increased less than fourfold. Population growth alone, with constant rates of emissions per person, could not account for the increase in the carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The world economy grew sixteenfold in the twentieth century, accompanied by enormous increases in the burning of gas, oil, and coal. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, population grew much faster in developing countries than in high-income countries, and, compared with population growth, the growth of carbon emissions to the atmosphere was even faster in developing countries than in high-income countries. The ratio of emissions-to-population growth rates was 2.8 in developing countries compared with 1.6 in high-income countries. Emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are influenced by the sizes and density of settlements, the sizes of households, and the ages of householders. Between 2010 and 2050, these demographic factors are anticipated to change substantially. Therefore demography will play a substantial role in the dynamics of climate changes. Climate changes affect many aspects of the living environment, including human settlements, food production, and diseases. These changes will affect poor people more severely than rich, and poor nations more severely than rich. Yet not enough is known to predict quantitatively many details that will matter enormously to future people and other species. Three kinds of responses are related to demographic issues that affect climate changes: universal secondary education, voluntary contraception and maternal health services, and smarter urban design and construction. These responses may prevent, reduce, or ameliorate the impacts of climate changes. They are as relevant to rich countries as to poor, though in ways that are as different as are rich countries and poor. They are desirable in their own right because they improve the lives of the people they affect directly; and they are desirable for their beneficial effects on the larger society and globe. They are effective responses to the twin challenges of reducing poverty and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Cohen J.E.","DOI":null,"x":7.6500000954,"y":6.0100002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":66,"Cited by":20.0,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"An (Extra)ordinary Night Out: Urban Informality, Social Sustainability and the Night-time Economy","Abstract":"A night out in the metropolis can offer a plethora of hedonistic experiences in urban spaces such as waterfront districts, shopping boulevards and cultural precincts.

As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like \"community supported fisheries\" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more \"green.\" Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of \"ocean literacy\" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals. \u00a9 2014 Timothy Beatley.

A concentration of people in the same geographic area who are of similar ethnic background, culture and language can be an important source of financial and personal support, information and guidance, and social mores. Evidence is found that, after controlling for a range of other observable and unobservable factors important to the location decision, the concentration of people of a particular ethnic group in a particular area has a significant effect on the chance that new immigrants of the same ethnic group will choose to live there. The size of the effect, however, depends on the personal characteristics of immigrants. The attraction of ethnic concentrations of immigrants is significantly smaller for new immigrants with a university degree and for those who normally speak English at home. Characteristics of the local ethnic community related to education and language profiles are also significant determinants of location choice. \u00a9 2004 by the Institute of Urban Studies All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Author Keywords":"Immigrants; Mobility; Neighborhood effects","Authors":"McDonald J.T.","DOI":null,"x":7.75,"y":7.3400001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":74,"Cited by":18.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Yanama budyari gumada: reframing the urban to care as Darug Country in western Sydney","Abstract":"In non-urban places of Australia, caring-as-Country frames natural resource management (NRM) as a practice of reciprocal, more-than-human care-giving (S.

The city has played a significant role in the history and development of at least three separate cultures-Polish, Lithuanian, and Jewish-and until very recently, no single cultural-linguistic group composed the clear majority of its population. Vilnius between Nations, 1795-2000 is the first study to undertake a balanced assessment of this particularly diverse city. Theodore Weeks examines Vilnius as a physical entity where people lived, worked, and died; as the object of rhetorical struggles between disparate cultures; and as a space where the state attempted to legitimize a specific version of cultural politics through street names, monuments, and urban planning. In investigating these aspects, Weeks avoids promoting any one national narrative of the history of the city, while acknowledging the importance of national cultures and their opposing myths of the city\u2019s identity. The story of Vilnius as a multicultural city and the negotiations that allowed several national groups to inhabit a single urban space can provide lessons that are easily applied to other diverse cities. This study will appeal to scholars of Eastern Europe, urban studies, and multiculturalism, as well as general readers interested in the region. \u00a9 2015 by Northern Illinois University Press.

The paper argues that many design policies inspired by the sustainability agenda do not take into account inclusive urban design considerations, and thus large sectors of the population are adversely affected. While attention is given to the needs of the disabled, particular emphasis is put in this paper upon the design needs of women and older people who together compose around a third of the population. The impact of compact layouts and higher densities in residential areas is first discussed, along with the problems created by increased car control, without commensurate transport policy alternatives, or adequate, safe pedestrian routeways. Second the problems of city centres are discussed where sustainability policy is also being targeted, but other priorities including the new urbanism, the 24-hour city, the evening economy and the city of culture jostle for pre-eminence. It is concluded that the lack of awareness of people's needs and inclusive design principles are reducing the chances of ordinary people accessing, comfortably moving around and enjoying the city. In order to bridge the gap between sustainability and inclusive design in planning, it is concluded that greater emphasis must be given to user needs and the constraints of everyday life.","Author Keywords":"Pavement design; Social impact; Sustainability","Authors":"Greed C.","DOI":"10.1680\/udap.2011.164.2.107","x":9.470000267,"y":6.9000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":77,"Cited by":18.0,"Year":2009,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Town planning in postcolonial India, 1947-1965: Chandigarh re-examined","Abstract":"The objective of this article is to reassess the new town building movement in India from 1947 to 1965 through a re-examination of the making of Chandigarh, to show how nationalism, modernism, and local regional influences affected the design and building of new towns. Chandigarh emerged as part of the post-Partition need for a new capital for the Punjab, and involved the efforts of several people and levels of government. The context of newly achieved nationhood became important in the way it shaped the ideals of both national and local political leaders, who wanted architects to transfer these into built form. How successful the architects were in this enterprise was shaped by their professional ideologies and understanding (or lack of it) of the local. Much scholarship exists on issues such as early decisions about Chandigarh's establishment, the Mayer and Le Corbusier plans for the city, and the buildings comprising the Capitol complex that were designed by Le Corbusier. Much less attention has been given to the residential areas of Chandigarh and all that lay beyond the Capitol complex and constitutes the actual town.

In particular, regime theory offers a complex account of urban governance, or how local governments, the business communities, and community organizations gain the capacity to shape the policies that affect cities, that is, govern. Although regime theory is a dominant theory in urban studies, it does, nevertheless, have its share of detractors, and one criticism has been its failure to take into account geographical scale. While there is an acknowledgment in urban regime theory of wider economic processes, such as the broad transformations in international and national trade, investment, finance, etc., or the role played by federal or state governments, the bias has remained mostly local, particularly in regards to urban governance. In urban regime theory literature the policies and actions of international and national institutions either nicely conjoin with local interests or are nearly totally absent. Due to this oversight, urban regime theory tends to underemphasize how the capacity to govern a city effectively is sometimes the result of the interaction of actions of people at multiple scales. This article attempts to address this oversight in an analysis of Glasgow, Scotland, during the 1980s. By focusing on the role of the European City of Culture in the revitalization of the city, this article demonstrates how the capacity for a ruling coalition to transform the city and to govern effectively was the consequence of the policy and administrative actions undertaken at other geographical scales. \u00a9 2008 Urban Affairs Association.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Tretter E.M.","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1467-9906.2007.00375.x","x":7.5300002098,"y":6.2199997902},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":79,"Cited by":17.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Talking about art(s): A theoretical framework clarifying the association between culture and place branding","Abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework to describe possible key features in the relationship between culture and place branding. The inspiration to redact this paper was drawn from the inadequacy of literature and attempts to introduce the theoretical framework linking these two fields by asking: how do we define culture within the context of place branding? How do decision makers distinguish whether culture should be at the forefront of a place branding strategy? On one hand, the paper points out the powerful advantages while using art(s) and culture-based activities to promote a place. On the other hand, the paper highlights the layered dilemmas for practitioners concerning the amalgamation of such a practice on a branding campaign. Those questions' clarification is achieved by means of a literature review that examines this relationship from a wide range of disciplines: sociology, marketing, place branding, cultural management, urban studies, etc. The paper's findings can be summarized in three points: first, culture plays a critical role on a place branding campaign, as long as the authentic cultural elements are produced by the residents. This practice helps to avoid the mass reproduction of \u201cborrowed\u201d cultural elements, i.e. the investment in cultural and leisure consumption industries. Second, the cultural field has already deployed practices used by local authorities in urban regeneration, such as cultural planning. Thus, converged objectives link cultural managers to place branding experts, refining multi-dimensional policy thinking towards a more integrated image. Finally, the cultural aspect is related with the pre-existing reputation of a place. Further, it is connected with the minds of people, fostering the contentions of common essence between culture and branding. This paper intends to contribute and enhance inter-professional thinking, by approaching the cultural sector with the appropriate sensitivity. The paper provides deeper understanding of culture, bordering the gap between technocrats and cultural-oriented professionals by contributing to the creation of a coherent communication system for the study of place branding theory. The cultural dimension of a place is very spacious and further research needs to be made, approaching the subject from new perspectives, such as people's perception of the brand while using art(s) as a branding tool. \u00a9 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Author Keywords":"Arts; Brands; Cultural mapping; Cultural planning; Culture; Place branding; Place development","Authors":"Kalandides A., Kavaratzis M., Boisen M., Scaramanga M., Scaramanga M.","DOI":"10.1108\/17538331211209059","x":8.1400003433,"y":8.8400001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":80,"Cited by":17.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Aquatic systems and water security in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico City","Abstract":"In megacities water quantity and quality are threatened by complex and interrelated processes caused by population growth, land use change, unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, erosion, destruction of ecosystems, lack of planning, laissez-faire policies, unsustainable water management, political conflicts, and increasingly also by the impacts of climate change.

Nonetheless, they also gave rise to problems of social exclusion and conflict, becoming undesirable facilities that weakened social health. This study examined ways of producing an improved building plan that can raise the level of social health of public apartments, which were consistently built in the past but will no doubt continue to be developed in the future. For this study, the survey method was employed through a questionnaire with visual contents especially developed to raise the level of social health based on two ideas. One was to increase the possibility of social interaction among residents, and the other was to increase opportunities for residents to interact with society as well as for their social integration. The results showed that residents had mostly favorable views on the proposed plans: in particular, they favored highly the formation of a lobby in each apartment building as a venue for social interaction. They also responded very favorably to the plan of creating within the buildings spare space that will be used not only to promote a communal culture, but to open to outside society as well for integration. This study showed vital ideas to ensure the recovery of the residential function of promoting social health in the public apartments of Korea. It has significance in inspiring an innovative approach to allow social mixture in a relatively different feasible manner from the conventional approach. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are urban public spaces that defy or at least resist these trends. Examining urban neighbourhood main streets reveals that even though the contemporary urban street can never be an unregulated place of unconstrained diversity, there are streets that counter the prevalent culture of consumption, and one can find visible signs of spontaneity and diversity of people and activities, and genuine social life.

It depicts the public and private developments, and especially the public housing which has sheltered millions of residents. The author identifies the architects practising in the formative years and the representatives of a rising generation after the 1980s. Suffering from land shortage and a dense environment, the urban development of Hong Kong has in the past 70 years met the changing demands of fluctuating economic activities and a rising population. Architecture on the island has been shaped by social demands, the economy and technology. The buildings have been forged by the government, clients, planners, architects, many contractors and end-users.

The negative consequences that commercial signs can have on the visual quality of urban areas and further more, on people's quality of life, has been studied from both architectural, planning and psychological perspectives. While the issue of visual pollution, as this phenomenon is commonly described, has been widely debated, there is as yet no clear conclusion as to how best to control commercial signage and whether different urban contexts and people from different backgrounds and cultures have universal or distinct preferences. Several different commenrcial signage approaches are currently applied to different historic cities, but these initiatives are not based on principles derived from the perception and evaluation of users. Drawing on a range of comparative and contrasting empirical studies of historic city centres in the UK and Brazil, this book examines questions of commercial signage control management, the preservation of historic heritage and user preference and satisfaction. The author takes an environment behaviour approach to this research, involving theories, concepts and methodologies related to environmental psychology, architecture, planning and urban design. In doing so, it argues that there are in fact visual preferences common to the majority of people, independent of their urban context and that these common views can be useful to the development of a general theory of how to control commercial signage. In conclusion, the book suggests that the best way of controlling signage is not only to recommend general guidelines related to the operation of commercial signage, but also to recommend design principles that can create commercial streetscapes evaluated positively by different users. \u00a9 Adriana Portella 2014.

It shows how large and exceptionally impressive creative clusters have been successfully established, but raises the important questions of whether profit or culture is the driving force, and of whether the bringing together of independent-minded, creative people, entrepreneurial businessmen, preferential policies and foreign investment may in time lead to unintended changes in social and political attitudes in China, including a weakening of state bureaucratic power. An important contribution to the existing literature on the subject, this book will be of great interest to scholars of urban studies, cultural geography, cultural economics and Asian studies. \u00a9 2011 Michael Keane.

It is rarely possible to do that, a special context and culture is needed, for instance, a republican culture, orienting people and decision-makers toward some common values and targets, is a precondition. After decades of individualism, to reconstruct a republican culture might be necessary, but it very difficult and not a short-term objective. It should be kept in mind that while strategic planning and planning in general are opportunities for the government and dependent on political will, land-use planning, even in a simplified zoning form, is a necessity: the urban market needs it; there is no way of managing city growth without some form of grids and regulations. This makes a big difference between strategic planning and land-use planning.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Mazza L.","DOI":"10.1080\/02513625.2013.859006","x":7.7399997711,"y":6.4000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":101,"Cited by":11.0,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Indigenous Rough Sleeping in Darwin, Australia: 'Out of Place' in an Urban Setting","Abstract":"Much of what is known of street homelessness is informed by accounts from urban centres throughout North America and the UK. The nature of the problem and the ways in which it is addressed are implicitly assumed to be similar across diverse major cities. The street homeless are thought to be highly marginalised and vulnerable. In turn, contemporary policy aims to provide housing\/accommodation and welfare to address this form of homelessness as deep exclusion. Based on empirical research in Australia's northernmost capital city, Darwin, this article demonstrates the role of culture in how homelessness is experienced and addressed. It argues that cultural mobility and modes of behaviour that normalise rough sleeping are embedded within condoned poverty and discriminatory legislation directed towards Indigenous people. Indigenous people are constructed as out of place in urban environments and rather than housing and welfare, the focus is directed towards moving the problem. \u00a9 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Parsell C., Phillips R.","DOI":"10.1177\/0042098013484541","x":6.9000000954,"y":8.0399999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":102,"Cited by":11.0,"Year":2000,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Virtual study abroad and exchange studio","Abstract":"The digital design studio has an area of application where conventional media are incapable of being used; collaboration in learning, design and dialogue with people in places other than where one lives.

However, Lean philosophy has not been well understood yet in the construction industry for the fact that the complexity and dynamic nature of construction projects bring up uncertainties that may be hardly handled by construction practitioners. Moreover, project-based nature of construction business makes Lean implementation even more challenging for construction people. Even though Lean efforts in construction have recently increased, there are problems with the implementation processes. It is undeniable that successful Lean implementation strongly affects project performance. Therefore, it is essential to reveal enablers and barriers in Lean implementation so that the construction industry practitioners might conduct projects more effectively and satisfy project requirements (i.e. schedule, budget, safety). This study aims to provide a set of core enablers and barriers of Lean implementation in construction projects and guide construction professionals to better satisfy project requirements. Within this context, the study proposes seven major enabler and barrier groups, namely the financial, managerial, technical, workforce, culture, government, and communication and twenty-seven components for each group. Moreover, a survey was designed and administered to Lean practitioners to rank the enablers and barriers based on importance level. Clear understanding of technical requirements in Lean practices was ranked as the most important enabler of Lean implementation whereas lack of top management support was ranked as the most important barrier in the Lean implementation. However, the average rankings were not found to be diverging indicating that selected components of enabler and barrier groups are properly chosen. The study is expected to lead Lean practitioners with creating value to customers while preventing them from experiencing waste. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Bayhan H.G., Demirkesen S., Jayamanne E.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/2\/022002","x":10.6400003433,"y":6.5799999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":106,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Key indicators for the resilience of complex urban public spaces","Abstract":"Qualified with the function of matter, culture, spirit, economy, and history, urban public space is a thorough introduction to the principles of urban design theory and mirror the characteristics of urban societies. Over the last couple of decades, urban areas in China context have been engaged in increasing initiatives and practices with views to facilitate people's lives and intensively utilize land resources. Echoing with these, the complex urban public spaces (CUPSs) with multi-layer structure integrated in three-dimensional space have been constructed in many cities, such as the integrated railway transport hub, airport terminal, and commercial complex. The CUPSs facilitate people's traffic transfer and satisfy people's multi-commercial functions requirements. However, the CUPSs are also subject to many kinds of risk events due to complex structure, crowded people in each layer and openness. Resilience is a kind of ability to resist risks, absorb the damage of risk events, and recover to normal operation situation, which presents high importance for the risk reduction. Gaining resilience and enhancing risk resistance ability of CUPSs are indispensable but indeed difficult as it is determined by lots of influencing indicators. In response, this paper intends to conduct a research on the exploration of key indicators for the resilience of CUPSs. Content analysis, expert investigation, and Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) will be adopted for the identification, analysis, and contribution evaluation of the key indicators. Prospectively, the key indicators in a sound taxonomy to break down the resilience will be obtained. The main findings of this research could provide useful references for governors and policy makers to enhance the resilience of CUPSs. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Complex urban public space; Indicator system; Resilience","Authors":"Xu H., Xue B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jobe.2017.06.018","x":10.8100004196,"y":7.3600001335},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":107,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Recognition of urban unsustainability in Iran (case study: Sanandaj City)","Abstract":"Rapid urban growth and urbanization in recent decades have caused changes in the structure of human habitations such as social and economic changes that would further clarify the importance of sustainable development and urban sustainability. Urban sustainability should create a balance between different aspects of economic, environmental, and social development. Therefore, this study aimed to determine various aspects of unsustainability in Iranian middle-large cities in order to provide strategies to improve the indicators and to achieve sustainability by finding the causes of failure to develop these indicators. Accordingly, first, urban sustainability indicators in four social, economic, physical and environmental aspects were presented. Then, the process of changing was determined through the study of these indicators in Sanandaj during two different periods; and indicators such as jobs, green urban economics, housing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), social participation, culture, public services and facilities, transportation, leisure, and medical care and health services were specified as unsustainability indicators in Sanandaj and other similar cities. Then, the following strategies are provided to improve urban sustainability in order to analyze the reasons for the decline or stagnation of these indicators: (1) strategies to revise the urban planning system in Iran; (2) strategies to improve the city's economy; and (3) strategies to improve the condition and status of poor people. The declining trend of unsustainability indicators could be reversed by applying these strategies. Furthermore, with the promotion of indicators, sustainable cities could be achievable. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Sustainable development; Urban planning system; Urban sustainability","Authors":"Azami M., Mirzaee E., Mohammadi A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2015.08.005","x":10.6599998474,"y":6.5399999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":109,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2006,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Urban beautification: The construction of a new identity in Chicago","Abstract":"DURING THE LAST 20 YEARS, cultural policy has become an integral part of economic and physical redevelopment strategies for many urban centers across the United States. Driven by deindustrialization, population decentralization, and globalization, many cities have turned to cultural strategies as a means to reposition themselves in a rapidly changing economic environment or to reaffirm their standing in an evolving metropolitan hierarchy. One factor fueling culture-driven strategies in urban development is that citizens now have more leisure-expendable income than ever before. This fact has led city governments to increase expenditures on culture and related specialized bureaucracies. As a result, policymaking bodies have ventured to enhance their provision of cultural services to cater to a growing, more differentiated, and increasingly sophisticated public demand. The outcome of these trends has resulted in the development of an economy of urban tourism. This has encouraged cities and their governments to turn their attention to policies that center on showcasing their cultural heritage, exporting their cultural identity, and translating these policies into revenue streams that can then be used for social and economic transformation. Hence, promoting festivals, arts, sport,music, cinema, conventions, and exhibits has come to be viewed as central activities of this strategy. This trend is the focus of an April 2000 report published by the National League of Cities entitled Tourism and Entertainment as a Local Economic Development Strategy: A Survey of City Halls (Judd et al. 2000), which discusses how tourist and entertainment infrastructure has recently emerged as a primary form of public investment in American cities. How has this tourism-focused economic restructuring come to fuel emerging urban-planning strategies? Although there is no simple answer to this question, multiple issues can be identified as factors that have caused the ascendance of urban tourism and associated public works activities. In the past, tourism and related cultural forms did not fit the planning mix and were viewed at best as inconsequential elements of local economic activity (Beauregard 1998). The motivation and rising demand for urban tourism may be found in two fundamental factors. The first can be drawn from a recent and continuing desire by people to explore the unfamiliar and to construct or to solidify their identity through travel and appropriately utilized leisure time (Law 2002).Whether it is the search for self- Actualization (Maslow 1970), the acquisition of \"cultural capital\" (Bourdieu 1984), or identity formation through consumption (Baudrillard 1988) and pilgrimages to famous places (MacCannell 1976), or even the \"tourist gaze\" as projected onto destinations by the media (Urry 1990), tourism and leisure activities have entered and influenced the realm of human experiences in ways more powerful and profound than ever before. The second factor relates more directly to the dynamics of city governance and to the contemporary condition of cities. The economic decline following the post war restructuring; the impact of globalization, which substantially reduced the primacy of the U.S. economy in production activities; and diminishing contributions by the federal government to the cities and states, presented a series of challenges for local officials facing the new fiscal reality of shrinking budgets and services. Cities responded by divorcing themselves from their manufacturing dependency; instead, they searched for ways to diversify and strengthen the various remaining sectors of their economy. Within this framework, urban tourism emerges as an appealing alternative, one that slowly has gained favor with local officials and civic boosters alike. As cities rush to take advantage of this new growth potential, they face numerous challenges, mainly in the areas of urban identity and urban competition. Specifically, how can a city with a formerly strong and nationally or internationally identifiable manufacturing economy convert itself intoa tourist destination?Most important, how does it convince potential visitors of its new services and sense of \"attractiveness\"? Similarly, what are its competitive advantages within this reformulated environment? The rise of urban tourism increases intermunicipal competition and requires cities to be more entrepreneurial. In Marketing Places: Attracting Investment, Industry, and Tourism to Cities, States, and Nations, international marketing guru Philip Kotler along with Donald H. Haider and Irving Rein (1993) definitively make the point that competition is a new reality that cannot be avoided: \"Places have to visualize a clearer sense of the functions they perform and the roles they play. . . . A place that fails to examine its prospects and potential critically is likely to lose out to more attractive competitors\" (p. 311). Within this context, the city is no different from the corporation that must engage in image-building activities, market its products, and be prepared to deal with change if it wants to maintain its competitive edge. The competition to attract tourists has had a tremendous impact on cities as spatial transformation, increased commodification, rapid segmentation of urban form and function, and new economic and planning mechanisms became widely introduced. The \"tourist bubble\" has emerged as a commonrestructuring strategy (Judd 2003; Judd and Fainstein 1999). Convention centers, theme parks, stadiums, and casino and riverboat gambling have reshaped the physical landscape and image of hundreds of dying urban cores. The city of leisure and entertainment, aimed at attracting locals and visitors, has caused a reorganization of planning policies and priorities (Clark 2003; Spirou and Bennett 2003, 37-58).

As the largest case of East German protest between the 1953 Uprising and 1989 Revolution, this intimate local trauma exhibits how the inner workings of a \u201cdictatorial\u201d system operated more broadly and exposes the often gray and overlapping lines between State and citizenry. Through deep analysis of untapped periodicals and archives, it introduces a broad cast of characters who helped make the demolition possible and restores the voices of ordinary citizens who dared in the name of culture, humanism, and civic pride to protest what they saw as an inconceivable tragedy. In this city that later started the 1989 Revolution triggering the fall of the Berlin Wall, residents from every social background desperately hoped to convince their leaders to step back from the brink. But as the dust cleared in 1968, they saw with all finality that their voices meant nothing, that the DDR was a sham democracy awash with utopian rhetoric that had no connection with their everyday lives.

Selected Issues","Abstract":"Creation of the built environment and research in this field pose a particularly difficult challenge nowadays. The pace of social and technological change does not allow for evolutionary development of cities and the formation of their land use according to current conditions. Creating spatial solutions that are unmatched in their contexts is becoming not only possible, but very probable (see Alexander, 1964). The development of the built environment involves not only art, technology, history, economics and law, but also philosophy, culture, medicine, psychology, sociology and many other spheres in which human life is manifested. However, only a relatively small number of disciplines such as spatial planning, urban design, urban planning, etc. (ignoring at this point the differences in the meaning of the concepts) in their application layer are meant to create space and bear responsibility for it. Also society has certain requirements of practical nature towards them. This article attempts to outline the nature of research on space urbanised by people and to determine the four main fields of research aimed at the problems of man and the built environment. In the next part, particular attention is paid to issues related to the impact of the built environment on the life of its residents in order to highlight the particular role and complexity of this area of research. This study, acting as a kind of test of the research, cannot be considered representative. Nevertheless, the analysis prompts several reflections on the current and future role of the built environment in the development of our civilisation, as well as further challenges related to it. \u00a9 2016 European Spatial Research and Policy 2016.","Author Keywords":"built environment; physical environment; quality of life; spatial planning; urban planning","Authors":"Lamprecht M.","DOI":"10.1515\/esrp-2016-0011","x":9.4600000381,"y":5.9299998283},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":114,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Borrowing from the past to sustain the present and the future: indigenous African urban forms, architecture, and sustainable urban development in contemporary Africa","Abstract":"Urban spatial expansion resulting from urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is not going to stop or stabilize in the near future.

Both have theoretical and practical underpinnings driving each discipline; are interdisciplinary in focus; and both professions gather and disseminate information to stakeholders. Essential to the success of each discipline is an engaged user population. The authors use a case study from the Village of Oak Park to examine and reflect upon the effect of the Internet and other technologies in the public's ability to participate in an open planning process. The Village of Oak Park is known for its architectural heritage and outspoken community. Within its 4.5 square miles live a diverse population of approximately 52,000 people from different cultures, races, ethnicities, professions, lifestyles, religions, ages, and incomes where a majority of the population have some advanced education and over 80% of the households report home Internet use. How does a community like the Village of Oak Park engage in the planning process? What role does information play in this process? Can modern Information Technologies facilitate civic engagement? These questions are examined during a year-long case study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in cooperation with the Village of Oak Park (VOP). Specifically, the investigators examined how information is gathered and used in the planning process and how the introduction of Information Technology (IT) tools influenced public participation and introduced many citizens to e-government through the planning process. The use of these tools is compared to the traditional planning process. Data from the project is presented to demonstrate a different kind of role librarians play in the research process. Last, the authors discuss the role of privacy in the gathering and sharing of information with the reliability of that information and the impact of privacy on the public planning process. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Focusing on a single aspect of a city or its people without understanding its context risks interventions which treat symptoms rather than causes and whose short-term 'solution' often means that the problem returns in the same or perhaps a different form. Our integrative analysis of Bangkok suggests that the root of its environmental (and some social) problems lie in decision-making structures and a political culture which has historically fostered self interested decisions by stakeholders rather than the public interest. This has produced a land use and built environment configuration that largely ignores the functioning of the natural flood plain ecosystem and the well-being of residents. People adapt their behaviour to their environment but often in ways that have serious cumulative impacts on the city. This analysis suggests that problems need to be addressed at their source: the nature of decision-making by stakeholders, at every level. This requires the engagement of all parties inside and outside government, the elite and otherwise. To the extent that planning has a viable role, the focus needs to be on the source of the impacts, such as national development planning, rather than in sectors such as transport, where the problems are evident.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Ross H., Poungsomlee A., Punpuing S., Archavanitkul K.","DOI":"10.1177\/095624780001200212","x":7.4499998093,"y":6.3400001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":117,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":1980,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Chicago sociology and urban planning policy - Sociological theory as occupational ideology","Abstract":"This account has provided one illustration of the possibility of an alternative approach to the sociology of knowledge other than the \"reductionist\" analysis of ideas as mere epiphenomena of material interests. If the sociology of knowledge cannot be pursued in any other fashion, the field's oft-lamented neglect seems entirely justifiable. But sociologists of knowledge can choose to define the purpose of their work, not as the exposure of perceptual distortions conditioned by social position, but as the elucidation of factors which lend certain formulations plausibility within a given socio-cultural context. Ironically, such explication of the relationship of ideology to work has been consonant with the developing Chicago tradition, although not unique to it, for Chicagoans have been concerned to elucidate the means by \"which people respond creatively to the limitations of their institutional context.\" As we have seen, the pre-World War II manifestation of that tradition has permitted urban bureaucrats to maximize their possibilities for action within the constraints of their formal obligations. Not only has their faith in the accuracy of evolutionist predictions sustained civil servants in the belief that they have maintained value-neutrality, but it has also allowed them to enjoy the pleasures of power and concrete accomplishment. For the city is conceptualized as an ever-expanding frontier, perpetually subjected to cycles of devastation and construction. Hence, while ostensibly acting as instruments of inexorable historical forces, urban bureaucrats are constantly provided with opportunities to raise tangible monuments to their personal authority. And evolutionist sociology has sanctioned a viable occupational strategy for the bureaucrat qua bureaucrat, for it justifies the civil servants' favored relationship with powerful clients, allowing them to negotiate their continued occupational survival. Although Chicago sociology has proved useful to planning professionals, I do not mean to suggest that its creators would have approved of the consequences of bureaucratic activity. In fact, both in method and substance the practices of government agencies have violated the human ecologists' ideal; Chicagoan Louis Wirth deplored planners' operational categories, arguing that they should be replaced with more sophisticated sociological ones. More importantly, federal officials used Chicago sociologists' projections to support policies counter to the Chicagoans' prescriptions for civilized society. Government policy has been effectively anti-urban. Based on the Chicago evolutionists' model, and in the name of sound business practices, central city decline has been assured and suburban expansion facilitated. Chicago sociologists saw conflict arising from large-scale urban migration and rapid industrialization, but they accepted conflict as necessary to progress; the highest development of civilization required diversity and an urban milieu. Within the city various groups created homogeneous communities, but heterogeneity of the population as a whole was essential to urban culture. Federal agencies, while adhering to the sociologists' premises, turned the model on its head; they sought to minimize conflict by eradicating social heterogeneity, and encouraged the growth of homogeneous suburban neighborhoods in which residents were protected from alien persons and lifestyles. \u00a9 1980 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Kuklick H.","DOI":"10.1007\/BF00169091","x":7.6999998093,"y":6.6599998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":118,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A sociotechnical approach to causes of urban blight using fuzzy cognitive mapping and system dynamics","Abstract":"Urban blight often is prominent in urban environments. It consists of real estate degradation to the extent that blighted residential properties, unfortunately, may provide housing only for the poorest social classes. Urban blight reduces real property values in urban neighborhoods and urban centers, reduces business investment and increases unemployment. Urban blight is not static, but continuously changing, either getting worse or improving. Thus, it is an issue of growing concern for urban decision makers who may attempt to determine its causes. Determining causes of urban blight facilitates the development of strategic measures for the prevention and potential eradication of this phenomenon. This study seeks to bolster the identification of factors that cause urban blight and makes important contributions to both the academic communities and society at large. By combining fuzzy cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach, our proposal facilitates the identification of urban blight determinants and the development of alternatives to control and eradicate them. Data used in our study were provided by a panel of urban blight experts, and allowed for the identification of the following major causes of urban blight: deficiencies in sociability and\/or culture; unfavorable economic and financial factors; policy and\/or administrative shortages; lack of urban regeneration; insecurity for people and assets; and building and\/or surroundings defects.

Specifically, the question being examined is how learning and information technology strategies can change the mindset of people to be more physically active in their mobility around a city. This is carried out by developing a system dynamics (SD) computer simulation model, where learning strategies that promote walking can be tested prior to implementation. Design\/methodology\/approach: Based on the specific key stages of knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation, the proposed SD model incorporates individual citizen and group level learning and diffusion processes in a unified integrated approach. The SD model gives a clear picture on how learning and changing mindsets occur in the context of a city, whereby we can explore the main drivers to learn new sustainability related habits. A case study is used to contextualize and demostrate the active mobility issue, in order to develop practical scenarios for promoting a walking mindset. This is done in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model and show its practicality. Through the model we investigate the relationships among variables such as awareness, contact, communication and adoption and evaluate their impact on city policies to promote a walking mindset. Findings: The developed SD model exhibits important dimensions, such as social learning, motivation to change behaviour and an analysis of the effects of plausible strategies for promoting sustainable active mobility. The authors have proven that through simulation experimentation, we can significantly accelerate the shaping and diffusion of a walking mindset, by influencing individual and community learning via the introduction of Information and Communication Technology in conjunction with an awareness campaign strategy. Research limitations\/implications: The diagrammatic representation and the quantification of the factors that contribute to active mobility give rise to better understanding of how policy makers could promote a walking culture in a city. The implications are that the proposed SD model could be used by city planning authorities as a framework for shaping mindsets towards active and sustainable mobility. Originality\/value: This paper contributes to the further understanding of learning, diffusion of new ideas and strategic planning within the city context. Through the proposed SD model, a number of strategies are formulated and tested using scenario planning, sensitivity analysis and optimization, in order to develop a walking mindset and an urban culture of sustainability. \u00a9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Active mobility; Diffusion theory; Learning capability; Organizational learning; System dynamics; Urban development","Authors":"Papageorgiou G., Demetriou G.","DOI":"10.1108\/SASBE-02-2019-0020","x":10.1499996185,"y":5.8499999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":120,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Minecraft as a tool for engaging children in urban planning: A Case study in Tirol Town, Brazil","Abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of Minecraft\u2019s game environment for urban planning with older and younger children in a public school in Tirol town, Brazil. Minecraft is employed as an innovative tool to tackle the present lack of engagement and involvement of key societal actors such as children and young people in urban planning. Thus, how can games support children to co-design their future city? Which heritage values do they represent graphically in the game environment? Geogames are games that provide a visualization of a real spatial context and in this study, Minecraft is the tool which we use to explore youth engagement. We designed two experiments, which tested Minecraft as a geogame environment for engaging young people in urban planning. These experiments were conducted with children, who emerged as active emancipated actors to bring their values to the planning practice. The playtesting results revealed the potential of Minecraft to keep children engaged in the design workshop, as well as their relevant ludic ability to co-create walkable, green, and interactive places. New research questions arose about the potential of creating a culture of planning among children in order to motivate other social actors to share responsibilities for sustainable development and management. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Children\u2019s engagement; Geogames; Minecraft; Urban planning","Authors":"de Andrade B., Poplin A., de Sena \u00cd.S.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi9030170","x":8.5,"y":7.5399999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":122,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Pocket Park: Product Urban design","Abstract":"Pocket Park, small areas that can make up for the emptiness, abandonment and no function of many spaces that are located within our cities, triggering processes of urban regeneration through the discovery of a new \"life\" and a new potentiality to accommodate.

Despite lip-service to \"triple bottom line\" assessments of policies and developments, Australia's policymakers have advanced no further than a \"double bottom line\" based on economic and environmental values, the latter preferably expressed in dollar terms. The economic (or market relation) also substitutes for the social dimension in a continued policy emphasis on customers rather than citizens or community members. An overemphasis on behavioural economics, a lack of social, political and cultural theory, and neglect of people's actual practices means that much policy and research around water fails to grapple with such basic social elements as gender, different roles and access to resources within households, cultural diversity, or ethical orientations. A major challenge is to mobilise rather than ignore the altruistic and socially-oriented human capacities for adapting to change beyond the customer relation or the confines of technical and economic rationality; including by collective innovations in values and practices of caring for water. \u00a9 Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Author Keywords":"Cultural innovation; Customer behaviour; Gender and water; Household water; Socially sustainable urban water; Sustainability models","Authors":"Sofoulis Z.","DOI":"10.7158\/W13-018.2013.17.2","x":7.0100002289,"y":6.3699998856},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":126,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Sustainable Cultural Spaces in the Global City: Cultural Clusters in Heritage Sites, Hong Kong and Singapore","Abstract":"[No abstract available]","Author Keywords":"Cattle Depot Artist Village, Hong Kong - a cattle slaughterhouse, in former British colony; Challenges, confronting sustainability of Cattle Depot Artist Village - lack of clarity of official responsibility, and broken chains of governance; Chinatown, Singapore's inscription of \"Chineseness\" - roots in colonial urban planning; Cultural clusters in heritage sites, Hong Kong and Singapore - sustainable cultural spaces in global cities; Cultural investment in urban and economic growth - space for cultural use; Cultural space, in global cities in Asia, Hong Kong and Singapore - local places, turned to cultural use; Culture-led urban regeneration and cultural\/creative economy - cultural investment, valued because of urban and economic regeneration; Global cities, and cultural spaces - vibrancy and viability of spaces, vitality of global cities; Global cities, networked nodes - multiple and intensive global flows of people, goods, services, ideas and images; Urban spaces, economic and cultural flows - characterizing global city","Authors":"Kong L.","DOI":"10.1002\/9781444395105.ch40","x":9.4600000381,"y":9.029999733},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":127,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban renewal and the creative underclass: Aboriginal youth subcultures in sydney's redfern-waterloo","Abstract":"Redfern-Waterloo, on the edge of Sydney's CBD, has long been an important center for the city's Aboriginal population, as a place to live, socialize, work, and\/or access services provided by the area's numerous Aboriginal organizations. State plans to regenerate Redfern-Waterloo, to realize its latent potential, far from seeking to displace the socially disadvantaged Aboriginal community and erase its cultural legacy, stress the importance of a continuing indigenous presence. Planning and policy documents generally suggest that Aboriginal people can contribute to, and reap the benefits of, the area's renaissance. This article will explore construction of minority cultures in planning discourse in Sydney and in particular the way indigenous culture and citizenship is delineated in the discourses of urban renewal. The vision of Aboriginal culture (and residual communal presence) is narrow and circumscribed by conventional \"touristic\" representations (fine art, dance, and other performance) around national heritage and consumption. This excludes many of the area's youth who, like their counterparts throughout the world, identify more with street culture-hip-hop, graffiti art, skateboarding, etc.-than with traditional arts\/high culture. These activities have little place in the vision for urban renewal. This article will argue that civic booster strategies that fail to recognize the complex and ambiguous character of public spaces and their importance as sites of resistant\/underground\/avant-garde\/youth subcultures will inevitably generate sterile landscapes; their vision of local communal heritage is little more than tokenistic. \u00a9 2012 Urban Affairs Association.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Morgan G.","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1467-9906.2012.00611.x","x":7.0,"y":8.1700000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":128,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Beside downtown: Global Chinatowns","Abstract":"For much of the nineteenth and twentieth century, in Barcelona's barrio chino\/barrixino, decaying tenements and crowded streets housed thousands of immigrant workers slaving in aging factories or seeking day- to- day opportunities at the nearby port. Only the broad, tree- lined Rambles, a promenade beloved of fl\u00e2neurs, separated the middling classes and elites of the historic city center from this \"Chinatown\" (this boulevard, in fact, had replaced an earlier urban wall). After dark, however, exotic nocturnal amusements including prostitution, drugs, and gambling lured adventurous bourgeois men, bohemian artists, journalists, and even transnational revolutionaries into the barrio chino. In the twenty- first century, nonetheless, as Barcelona's post- Olympic urban revitalization has spread from the port and historical core outward, this \"Chinatown,\" rechristened as the historic Raval, has been demolished in favor of neoliberal development of sanitized public spaces, new hotel and tourist ser vices, gentrified residences, and cultural facilities including museums, foundations, and the Universitat de Barcelona. The Raval has displaced the chino, its older inhabitants, its bars, social centers and memories (McDonogh 1987, 2002; McNeill 1999; Magriny\u00e0 and Maza, this volume). While this may seem to be a stereo typical Chinatown in location, function, and imagery, it differs from others where we have worked in a fundamental demographic element- the absence of Chinese. Barcelona had few Chinese until the 1990s. Instead, many inhabitants of this dense central zone had arrived from poorer Spanish regions of Andalusia and Aragon. Journalist Paco Madrid borrowed the sobriquet \"Chinatown\" in 1927 from his reading of San Francisco, using barrio chino as an urban metaphor to evoke an ambience of cosmopolitan mystery and Barcelona's status as a world city (McDonogh 1987). When the first waves of Chinese arrived in Spain in the late 1990s, in fact, they settled elsewhere, including an important cluster next to the downtown area of a suburban Barcelona satellite city, Santa Coloma. Nonetheless, Barcelonans' metaphorization of the early twentieth- century location and imagery of Chinatowns, like the demands and pressures of center city development that continue to change the area, are familiar and even suggestive phenomena for global downtowns. For more than a decade we have lived, worked, and studied in Chinatowns worldwide, including Chinese enclaves in and around Chicago, New York, Sydney, Lima, Los Angeles, Bangkok, Havana, Paris, San Jos\u00e9, Panama City, and S\u00e3o Paulo, in addition to our anchorage in Wong's native Hong Kong and our home in Greater Philadelphia. These Chinatowns sometimes have been backgrounds for other projects in urban studies, mass media, architecture, and visual culture (for example, Wong 1991, 1999); they also have become interwoven with lives of our family and friends. Our experiences and investigations underpin the complexities of multisite downtown ethnography through which we have examined shared characteristics of place, function, ideology, and evolution (McDonogh and Wong 2005). These social, special, and cultural features embody both Chinese agency and evolving Chinese globalization, although we do not develop such a phenomenological exploration here. Instead, we argue that Chinatowns are deeply enmeshed with the structure and nature of central districts that such Chinatowns often border, a relationship mapped decades ago by Burgess and the Chicago School (Burgess 1925: 56). Chinatowns provide a multivalent vantage from which to illuminate critical features of global downtowns, including the evolution of central spaces and functions, the competitive markets for people and capital they embody, and the play of locality, region, nation- state, and transnational articulation shaping downtowns as well as Chinatowns. To analyze the dialectic of Chinatowns and global downtowns, we consider five specific themes: (1) the emergence and movement of Chinatowns in relation to urban cores; (2) the imagery of Chinatowns as cultural spaces that illuminates race, immigration, gender, and morality in downtowns; (3) competing contemporary demands for land, development, and movement, both Chinese and non- Chinese; (4) the meaning of Chinatowns in relation to suburban and global networks; and (5) new Chinatowns as a counterpoint to future downtowns. Together, these themes underscore the fact that Chinatowns are not exotic alternative spaces but offer fundamental insights on downtowns as urban\/regional places of political economic power, social structure, and cultural meaning constituted by multilayered and contested global flows of goods, people, knowledge, and imagery.

COVID-19-induced immobility in the mobile risk society","Abstract":"Since the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) declared the Coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, the virus has invaded lives around the globe. The ongoing health, social and economic crisis that followed forced urban life, business, culture, community etc. into idle mode for weeks resulting from mandated immobility. What was once taken for granted as the essence of urban experience such as cultural activities, meeting friends, relatives and colleagues in public space or in professional encounters, disappeared overnight. Free movement became significantly restricted all over the world. It seemed that immobility, social and physical distancing, and isolation were the only antidote to the fast-moving virus. For many people, working from home while also schooling their children and providing social care at a distance, peak activity at maximum physical immobility became the \u201cnew normal.\u201d A culture emerged where rules and norms of mobilities previously taken for granted were re-negotiated and re-defined. Before the crisis and despite the negative ecological side effects, mobility has been positively connotated as a signifier for progress and success. Under the Corona regime mobility turned into a life-threatening risk. The theory of reflexive modernization, risk society and the mobilities paradigm are used to discuss these contemporary shifts and transformations. \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"automobility; COVID-19; crisis; mobile risk society; Networked urban mobilities; planning; reflexivity","Authors":"Freudendal-Pedersen M., Kesselring S.","DOI":"10.1080\/17450101.2020.1846436","x":9.6700000763,"y":5.7699999809},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":132,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban afforestation and favela: A study in A community of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Abstract":"More than half of the world's population inhabit urban areas, causing significant environmental changes. In underdeveloped countries this fact is expressed in a chaotic manner, generating social and structural problems. The city of Rio de Janeiro is a megalopolis known worldwide for its natural beauties, including beaches and forests and because of favelas (subnormal clusters of houses of economically poor people).The favelas are composed of a mosaic of cultures which reflects even in urban afforestation. In this work we characterize the afforestation structure of a favela to understand its ecological and social functionalities. The survey was conducted in the favela Morro da Formiga, with an area of approximately 30 ha. It was conducted through a census and using the list of species, a classification based on 11 parameters was carried out. 1,042 individuals were found, belonging to 110 genera, 148 species and 42 families. The most abundant species shows that the planters intend is, leastwise partially, generating an extra-support for community in terms of feeding fruits (62% of the subjects had this purpose). In relation to the nature thereof, the natives species represents 54% of the total, while the exotic species 39%. About 50% of the trees are in the backyards of houses and a few in squares and streets. It was found that 70% of individuals were planted by residents. Studies are needed to identify which native species can replace community demands currently supplied by exotic species that have been used for decades. The \u201cforestation\u201d in favelas is quite distinct from that implemented by the city hall in more urbanized areas. In favelas, the species reflect more about the knowledge of the local population, their backgrounds and needs. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Author Keywords":"Rio de Janeiro; Slums; Urban ecology; Urban forestry","Authors":"Sartori R.A., Martins G.A.C., Za\u00fa A.S., Brasil L.S.C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ufug.2018.10.004","x":8.6199998856,"y":5.4400000572},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":134,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Bridges in Urban Planning and Architectural Culture","Abstract":"Bridges obviously serve multiple functions but the primary purpose is to traverse a terrain obstacle to get goods and\/or people across to the other side.

The results of statistical analyses by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Mann-Whitney test show, regardless of the dimension considered, to what extent certain areas are characterized by frequency, duration, or intensity of the conflict activity. Specifically, the results suggest that the degree of involvement of local people in a conflict varies very much depending on the nature of the social composition. Other findings show a relationship between areas with a high propensity to associate and to voice and a conflict activity that is more intense, more frequent, but not necessarily longer. These forms of social practices are thus testimony to the existence of know-how, i.e., a culture of conflict activity oriented towards efficiency. \u00a9 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Author Keywords":"Spatial analysis; Statistical analysis; Territorial decision-making processes; Urban conflicts; Urban environments","Authors":"Pelletier M., Joerin F., Kestens Y., Villeneuve P.Y.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12061-010-9050-8","x":7.6999998093,"y":7.2300000191},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":138,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Extending boundaries with meta-design and cultures of participation","Abstract":"Human-computer interaction (HCI) has refocused many research efforts within computer science from a technology-centered view to a human-centered view.

This paper provides a conceptual framework based on meta-design and cultures of participation that democratize design and allows all stakeholders to evolve systems to fit their needs. It establishes a new extended discourse for HCI research in which information technologies are interwoven with human lives in all aspects of our existence (at home, working, teaching, learning, and being a citizen). Specific socio-technical environments instantiating the framework in different application domains are described, including: (1) environments for people with cognitive disabilities, (2) table-top computing systems for framing and solving complex urban planning problems, (3) modeling the buildings of the world in 3D, and (4) using Smart Grids to support energy sustainability. These examples show how metadesign and cultures of participation are design approaches that allow researchers and practitioners to extend boundaries by allowing all stakeholders to have more control over their artifacts and by providing opportunities to encourage and to support contributions by many people in personally meaningful activ ities. \u00a9 2010 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Boundaries; Control; Cultures of participation; Distances; Meta-design; Motivation; Socio-technical environments; Systemic problems","Authors":"Fischer G.","DOI":"10.1145\/1868914.1868937","x":8.779999733,"y":7.3099999428},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":139,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2010,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Rethinking urban design for a changing public life","Abstract":"Purpose \u2013 The nature and conceptualization of public space and public life have been always associated with collective participation and socialization \u2013 in other words, the capacity to live together among strangers.

Public Art in Canada broadens the critical discussion by exploring public art's varied means of engaging with public space and the public sphere. Annie G\u00e9rin and James S. McLean have assembled contributions from new and established Canadian scholars, curators, and artists. Each contributor enlivens our understanding of public art as a practice and its place in the social and aesthetic formation of which it is a part. As a result, the book provides an overview of the current debates in the field of public art that are informed by the theories and critical literature of art history, communication studies, cultural studies, sociology, and urban studies. The rigorous essays and original works of art collected in this volume present a compelling demonstration of the strategies, aesthetic and otherwise, used by artists to elicit intellectual, sensual, or emotional responses that can only be obtained through artistic practices in public places.

It shows how improvisation emerges in the interstices between uncertain flux and ossified rigidities to construct in-between spaces of ambiguous political openings even in ostensibly formal, rigid contexts. To that end, it draws on documents, media reports, interviews and participant observation to analyse the multiple mutations of what eventually became the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Centre in Ekaterinburg, a cultural flagship in Russia\u2019s third largest city. Morphed from an abandoned office block into a memorial multi-purpose complex, the Yeltsin Centre is the product of elites and ordinary people responding to conjunctural openings in seemingly inert structures. While highlighting the political openings made possible by improvisation inhabiting the in-between, the paper also underscores the ambiguous nature of this practice and its limits. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","Author Keywords":"culture; flagship projects; global urbanism; Improvisation; Russia; urban politics","Authors":"M\u00fcller M., Trubina E.","DOI":"10.1177\/0263775820922235","x":9.25,"y":4.6300001144},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":143,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Racial projections: cyberspace, public space, and the digital divide","Abstract":"Scholars of critical race studies, urban history, and information and communications technologies (ICTs) share an interest in the relationship between spatial and racial disparities, including the quality of basic infrastructure, degrees of connectivity, and participatory culture. However, contemporary research on the digital divide struggles to link historical legacies of uneven development, as well as social justice strategies, with digital participation in urban spaces. By examining contemporary digital art that critiques the spatial inequalities encountered by U.S. racial minorities, this article illustrates how public intellectuals use ICTs in ways that draw upon past strategies to territorialize space for political ends. It focuses on digital pop-ups, open-air installations that cast images onto public space using projectors. Historicizing these new efforts illustrates a continuity of tactics engaged by communities of color in response to socio-spatial inequalities in the urban United States, such as the 1970s mural movement\u2019s efforts to re-politicize spaces of exclusion. While existing literature finds that digital inequality results in differential digital human capital, this research indicates that place-based claims, such as digital pop-ups, are important sites for combatting racial injustice and creating more inclusionary spaces, especially among youth adults. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"digital arts; Digital divide; race; urban studies; young people","Authors":"Carpio G.G.","DOI":"10.1080\/1369118X.2016.1271899","x":7.6799998283,"y":8.0100002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":144,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Disruption, resilience, and vernacular heritage in an Indian city: Pune after the 1961 floods","Abstract":"This paper offers insights into production of vernacular architectural heritage that result from disruption caused by disaster such as a flood in a city. To understand the complexities surrounding vernacular heritage, this paper proposes a conceptual approach derived from Lefebvre\u2019s theory of production of space constituting the triad of spatial practice, representation of spaces and representational space. The strength of this approach in explaining resilience and vernacular architectural heritage is illustrated by examining rehabilitation settlements that evolved after the devastating floods of 1961 in Pune (a city with a population of 4.5 million). The paper focuses on the rehabilitation process that was undertaken in response to the floods and relies on secondary data and primary field observations in the rehabilitated settlements. It was found that these settlements had twofold characteristics; externally, they directed the trajectory of growth and expansion of the city owing to their strategic location in the periphery around the old core, and internally within, they contributed to reshaping of urban form and vernacular architecture as the affected people reconstructed their houses and everyday lives. A significant contribution to the making of these rehabilitation spaces was the state\u2019s provision of land for rehabilitation and encouragement to the mechanism of Cooperative Housing as a representation of space incorporating contemporary planning ideologies. These settlements comprised the \u2018architecture of the dispossessed\u2019 where material culture and imagery informed different and hybrid forms of houses but these were a departure from the past as they needed to accommodate rebuilding and expansion while serving aspirations of those affected. \u00a9 2016, \u00a9 Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.","Author Keywords":"disruption; floods; heritage; India; Pune; resilience; vernacular architecture","Authors":"Shinde K.A.","DOI":"10.1177\/0042098016652777","x":7.6700000763,"y":5.0199999809},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":145,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The right to walk in cities, a comparative review of Macau, Lisbon and Las Vegas","Abstract":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze walking activity and recent efforts at augmenting walkability conditions in the cities of Macau, Lisbon and Las Vegas. Design\/methodology\/approach: The methodology consisted mostly of in-loco observations, pedestrian counts and extensive reviews of the literature, city plans and regulations. Findings: The findings include the need to properly design, maintain and retrofit pedestrian facilities, while reducing safety conflicts among street users as well as the establishment and the nurturing of a culture of walking. Research limitations\/implications: A fivefold international walkability research agenda with implications for other cities around the world is established: the value and the need for comparative studies and best practices; the need for urban design interventions; the cultivation of attractiveness and aesthetics; the implementation of safety, construction and maintenance criteria; and responsible funding programs. Practical implications: This paper has twofold implications for stakeholders with direct responsibilities in the design, planning, building and maintenance of streets and public spaces, and for those who simply use those places at their own discretion. Social implications: A succinct set of recommendations include the need to augment endogeneity, the need to make cities for people and not for automobiles and commitment to resolving pedestrian safety concerns.

However festivals, episodic events lasting a few days, do provide such functions. They take people outside their routine behaviours of work, leisure and family, providing joy, excitement and new experiences, sometimes linking to historical traditions. Although such events have always been part of the life of the bigger places, new valuations of their utility have led to an enormous growth in such activities in recent decades, both in numbers within cities, and many other urban places, adding to their vitality and often providing major economic returns. A review of the variety of festivals shows that most fall into six main types, linked to temporal or cyclical, religious, political, tradition-heritage, new cultures and lifestyle functions, although some may overlap the categories and others have morphed from one type to another through time. A multidimensional model of the nature of festivals based on eight components provides a basis for assessing their varied character and reveals their often contradictory nature and conflicted consequences. \u00a9 2015, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Author Keywords":"Festival dimensions; Festival growth; Festival impacts; Festival typology","Authors":"Davies W.K.D.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-94-017-9655-2_14","x":8.2700004578,"y":8.8500003815},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":147,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"From designed spaces to designer savvy societies: The potential of ideas competitions in willing participation","Abstract":"The design of public space has gained importance as cities are increasingly positioned in global flows of people, capital, and ideas. These spaces speak to the culture of a place as much as to the quality of its design, but the implementation of design as an inclusive process is fraught with difficulty. This is particularly pertinent in discussions about better ways of engaging people with urban design, where there is often a language barrier between those who specialise in spatial manipulation and the broader 'society' that uses this space. This paper gives an empirical account of how a spatial consciousness can be translated to society through an international design competition. The competition method of urban design relies upon promotion and 'eventfulness', both of which interpolate the public and contribute towards the generation of a deeper interest in the spatial imaginary of city planning. The creation of 'urban design consumers' through the visual consumption of the designs themselves offers an alternative way to gain public interest to the established traditions of public notices and formal public meetings. In this case, the competition extended the activity of urban designers beyond the mechanics of 'space production' to include 'consumer production' where a more intimate relationship between city planning and the people began to emerge.","Author Keywords":"Competition; Consumerism; Public spaces; Urban design","Authors":"Picken F.","DOI":"10.1068\/a45460","x":8.6400003433,"y":7.4899997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":148,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Small businesses and the vitality of main street","Abstract":"People use the neighborhood Main Street for shopping but also for other leisurely activities, active and passive engagement, social affiliation and interaction, sensory stimulation, and relaxation. Traditionally, small businesses have made up a fair share of businesses on Main Street.

These findings have implications for urban design, community planning, and economic development policies because they suggest that small businesses influence their immediate public space by paying more attention to it than large businesses.

Through making art-amateur and professional, formal and informal1-communities preserve, invent, and assert their identities; transmit heritage; and comment on their existence. Art and cultural participation contribute to community conditions in education, economic development, civic engagement, and to stewardship of place (Jackson et al. 2003; Jackson and Herranz 2002). Based on years of research,we know that murals, altars, choirs,music bands, ethnic dance troupes, embroidery and quilting groups, drumming circles, theater troupes, parades, and festivals are all examples of what people describe as cultural assets in communities around the United States.These are artistic and creative outlets that are a crucial aspect of quality of life.They are valued for the intrinsic properties of art and contribute to the community's well-being. They are found in a variety of places, including formal cultural presentation venues such as museums and theaters, small and midsize organizations where artists gather to make art and produce events, and in community cultural centers. But they also occur with great frequency, formally and informally, in places and through organizations that are not primarily concerned with the arts, such as schools, churches, parks, community centers, social service organizations, social clubs and benevolent societies, and sometimes businesses and commercial retail establishments. Moreover, arts and non-arts entities often have to work together to make cultural participation possible (Jackson and Herranz 2002). Although arts and cultural participation at the community level are at the heart of community life, many policy makers, urban planners, and arts administrators have not acknowledged the arts as an essential part of a community's core, to the detriment of communities. The range of opportunities for cultural participation needed for a healthy community eludes many of these players. Instead, large cultural institutions concerned primarily with presenting formal professional arts, often with ties to the nonprofit and public sectors, have dominated with their ideas of what constitutes the arts world and the cultural sector. Activity at all artistic skill levels, often in smaller arts and cultural organizations as well as through other public, private, and commercial arts outlets, exists at the periphery of recognition, even though in reality it is at the center of real life in communities. In the arts administration and cultural policy field, informal arts practices were formally recognized as an important aspect of the cultural sector during an American Assembly meeting in 1997 focused on the arts and their public purpose.2 During that meeting, the importance of ethnographic research that could capture informal, amateur, community-based, and unincorporated arts, in addition to quantitative or statistical research on other aspects of the sector, was emphasized. Since that time, research on this kind of informal or unincorporated activity has continued, although work is still needed to position this aspect of the cultural sector in a way that does justice to the significance of its role in society. This chapter sets out to challenge the dominant model that relegates community arts and culture to the sidelines; it offers an alternative set of values that has implications for how arts administrators, urban planners, and policy makers should pursue their work in planning, urban design, funding, and cultural programming. With better research about communities and charged with defining and engaging with the creative economy3 and the ideology of the creative city,4 they have an opportunity to reassess their assumptions and approaches. The material presented here is based on years of research completed by the Urban Institute on the arts and artists in community life.5 Research has included participant observation of arts-related activities and events in neighborhoods all over the United States as well as hundreds of interviews and scores of focus group discussions with artists, arts administrators, urban planners, community development professionals, policy makers, and community residents. It has also included general population surveys on cultural participation and attitudes toward artists. \u00a9 2008 by Rutgers University Press.

Its premise is that there are vestiges of tradition which remain part of the urban fabric in most southern Nigerian towns. It is thought that these traditions can, and should, be developed further to ensure that there is a positive integration of the old with the new, in the physical form, aesthetics and theoretical interpretation of urban design. Also as a development model, this integration approach has considerable relevance to other aspects of Nigerian urban life where there is the need for the accommodation of various cultures and social backgrounds. Relevant material, including documented data, will be used to discuss the premises and theories put forward. Central to the main theme is the argument for a re-ordering of architectural design and urban planning in southern Nigeria to better accommodate the more traditional or cultural features of life as the illustrations shown will highlight. The paper focuses specifically on the Igbo-speaking area of South-eastern Nigeria. The development of its housing fabric has varied distinctly from that of Northern and South-western Nigeria, which both have the effects of Islamic influence and, in the latter region, Brazilian and European influence, on local culture to be considered. Both these regions have had more urbanised and cosmopolitan cultural indigenous development patterns than the south-east. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with these Nigerian regions and other developing areas. It would seem that 'Igboland' escaped these influences mainly due to its geographical location in the hinterland of South-eastern Nigeria. Islam did not penetrate as far down from North-eastern Nigeria to the south-east as it had done from North-western Nigeria to the south-west. This was partly due to the more tropical humid terrain which was detrimental to horses and mounted warfare and the way in which religious wars or Jihads were traditionally fought. Also, the acephalous societal organisation of the Igbos, when contrasted with the more hierarchical Northern Hausa and Western Yoruba societies, were less predisposed to convert voluntarily from native individualised worship to a more structured heirarchic monotheistic religion. Being away from the Atlantic coast of Nigeria meant that European influence took longer to affect hinterland Igbo lifestyles. It also meant that the area had few settlements of repatriated and freed African slaves who had made their way back to Nigeria from America and Brazil. Called Saros and Agudas respectively, these returnees brought with them new cultural styles and established residential settlements which were influential in the development of coastal towns such as Lagos and Calabar. Similarly, missionary and government enterprise reached the Igbo hinterland much later than the coast, thus Christianity and its cultural influence was felt much later in this area. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with other Nigerian regions and other developing countries.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Uduku O.","DOI":"10.1016\/0197-3975(95)00052-6","x":6.9899997711,"y":5.4200000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":153,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Hybrid coordination of city organisations: The rule of people and culture in the shadow of structures","Abstract":"Under far-reaching reforms, many cities have delegated core tasks previously delivered by their administrations to independent organisations that they formally own, e.g. municipal companies, or supervise, e.g. municipal trust funds. The coordination of these (as we call them) \u2018domestic\u2019 city organisations has proven challenging.

Addressing this gap, we ask: How do governance modes interact in the hybrid coordination of domestic city organisations? Analysing the case of Vienna, where 100 domestic organisations employ about 60,000 people, we find that while cultural mechanisms, rooted in the network mode, are predominant, they unfold in the shadow of latent structural mechanisms, which are associated with hierarchy and market. In the background, structural mechanisms keep cultural coordination effective, while cultural mechanisms allow structural coordination to remain (generally) hidden.

But theoretical perspectives formulated in Western urban contexts tend to assume clear-cut distinction between Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft, and between the public and private realms, and assume that encounter automatically steers people towards the ethics and politics of difference. These optics represent epistemologies which for the most part address the socio-spatial nexus in Euro-American urban modernity, and are ill equipped for elucidating the contingent, improvised relationships between public space and multiple urban modernities beyond the West. This paper works on the trail of the comparative urbanism and delves into configurations of publicness in \u201csquare dance\u201d in reform-era urban China. Starting from historical conceptions of publicness in China but being mindful of how they are reconfigured and renegotiated amid a rapid transition towards urban modernity, this paper argues that publicness in reform-era China is of a largely experimental, negotiated nature. On the one hand, square dance exceeds sociological accounts and categories which produce epistemological opposition between stranger and community, between public self and intimate affiliations. It incubates sentiments of collectivism that overcome anonymity and strangeness but do not contradict the ethos of individualism in the modern city. On the other hand, square dance can be conceptualised as an active process of urban learning, in which people are motivated to reflect over what codes, rules, and ethics are needed for governing urban publics. In all, this paper aims to broaden the conceptual spectrum of the ideas of public space and urban civic cultures through comparative analysis and theorisation.

From streets lined with vehicles made by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors and driven by the nearly 2 million people who called the city home in 1950 to certain parts of the city looking like ghost towns; from a population that dwindled to 670,000 to the revival of downtown. Yet, what has been remarkably consistent is the invisibility of the Motor City\u2019s Indigenous population. Indeed, Indigenous erasure, combined with rhetoric and policies that continue to marginalize and subjugate African Americans in Detroit, create a place rooted in multiple colonialisms. This essay examines how Detroit\u2019s Indigenous Hip Hop artists resist settler colonialism through art, creativity, and culture as well as the practices of Detroit 2.0, a rhetoric and policy used by Detroit elites to reimagine it as a place of opportunity. By making visible the connections between blackness and indigeneity, as well as by linking the struggle of colonized peoples in Detroit to those in Palestine, Indigenous artists are not only asserting their humanity and challenging the longstanding idea of their erasure, but also constructing pathways for artists and activists to disrupt the effects of multiple colonialisms that continue to marginalize people of colour in urban areas.

Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO2eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W\/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Hidalgo-Cordero J.F., Garc\u00eda-Navarro J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/245\/2\/022068","x":8.9300003052,"y":5.2800002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":160,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A Changing Labour Market under the Intensification of Dualization. The Experience of a Southern European Society","Abstract":"Fifty years ago, a Portuguese sociologist, Ad\u00e9rito Sedas Nunes (1964), used the image of a \u2018dual society under evolution\u2019 to refer to Portugal. Since then, the image of Portugal as a country simultaneously old and new, (post) modern and traditional was used by several social scientists in various fields of research (migration, urban studies, social policy, education, culture). In spite of the remarkable process of modernization the country has experienced during this period of time, inequalities and dualisms continue to be deeply embedded in the economic and social system and were even intensified by recent austerity measures in the context of massive unemployment and economic distress. In the article, I examine two specific domains where signs of dualism(s) persist, the labour market and the system of welfare, and investigate how the interconnectedness between the two is generating new forms of social and economic inequalities. Reforms in the labour market have been under constant reform within the last decades, representing, for a large and increasing number of individuals, more precarious working conditions, low paid jobs, unstable lives with intermittent careers. At the same time, governmental policies have contributed to diminish the level of social protection for labour market participants in precarious employment as well as for people without jobs. This article aims at providing a contribution to the literature on dualization focusing on the link between changing forms of integration in the labour market and transformations in the social protection system, examining its specific configuration in one of the countries belonging to the Southern European welfare regime. \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Author Keywords":"Dual society; Inequality; Insiders; Labour market; Outsiders; Social protection","Authors":"Valadas C.","DOI":"10.1111\/spol.12290","x":8.7899999619,"y":4.8499999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":161,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Applying social norms to high-fidelity pedestrian and traffic simulations","Abstract":"Smart cities are founded on complex interactions among architectural and urban designs, sensors, actuators and crowds of people with their devices. In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement. In order to allow for a more effective participation of humans in the simulation, our approach does not use central coordinators or coordination protocol, but rather each agent takes its own decision so to make more realistic interactions. A software architecture and initial experimental results are presented and discussed. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Robol M., Giorgini P., Busetta P.","DOI":"10.1109\/ISC2.2016.7580808","x":8.8800001144,"y":6.5399999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":162,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Sustainability achievement and estidama green building regulations in Abu Dhabi vision 2030","Abstract":"Abu Dhabi is the capital of the UAE country and one of seven cities that composed the United Arab Emiratis.

Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid-1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world's most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition, greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay. Campbell dispels long-held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize-winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision. As a national symbol, the Gateway Arch has a singular place in American culture, Campbell concludes, yet it also stands as an instructive example of failed urban planning. \u00a9 2013 by Tracy Campbell.

Much of this housing is targeted to communities that are predominantly Aboriginal. Little consultation has occurred about the underlying cultural assumptions of the design of these homes. This is in spite of the fact that the layout of a home may significantly direct the life ways of a family or affect their relationships to relatives or neighbours. Lack of consultation has proved problematic in some Indigenous communities, whereas in those few cases where consultation has occurred, the emerging designs have been significantly different from conventional designs. This article describes a four-year process of consultation on cultural concepts in the design of buildings intended for Aboriginal families in urban communities in Manitoba. Participatory design activities drew out numerous themes that, if incorporated into buildings, might help Indigenous families retain or recover their cultural values and lifeways. A number of these Indigenous themes have been incorporated in buildings that have already been constructed. The themes relate not just to the decorative features of the buildings but to conceptual assumptions underlying their design. The article concludes with some public policy recommendations. \u00a9 2010 by the Institute of Urban Studies.","Author Keywords":"Aboriginal culture; Housing design; Participatory design","Authors":"Deane L., Smoke E.","DOI":null,"x":6.6799998283,"y":7.6900000572},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":165,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Learning to belong? \u2018Culture\u2019 and \u2018place making\u2019 among children and young people in Hull, UK City of Culture 2017","Abstract":"Despite the rise of \u2018child-friendly cities\u2019 internationally, and a growing interest in youth engagement in urban planning, the role of children and young people in culture-led regeneration and \u2018place making\u2019 schemes, remains under-researched.

'To whom does hip hop belong?' 'For what constructive purposes can hip hop be put to use?' These are three key questions posed by hip hop activists in Hip Hop Versus Rap, which explores the politics of cultural authenticity, ownership, and uplift in London's post-hip hop scene. The book is an ethnographic study of the identity, role, formation, and practices of the organic intellectuals that populate and propagate this 'conscious' hip hop milieu. Turner provides an insightful examination of the work of artists and practitioners who use hip hop 'off-street' in the spheres of youth work, education, and theatre to raise consciousness and to develop artistic and personal skills. Hip Hop Versus Rap seeks to portray how cultural activism, which styles itself grassroots and mature, is framed around a discursive opposition between what is authentic and ethical in hip hop culture and what is counterfeit and corrupt. Turner identifies that this play of difference, framed as an ethical schism, also presents hip hop's organic intellectuals with a narrative that enables them to align their insurgent values with those of policy and to thereby receive institutional support. This enlightening volume will be of interest to post-graduates and scholars interested in hip hop studies; youth work; critical pedagogy; young people and crime\/justice; the politics of race\/racism; the politics of youth\/education; urban governance; social movement studies; street culture studies; and vernacular studies. \u00a9 2017 Patrick Turner.

Developing Guidelines for Human-centered Outdoor Spaces in China that Citizens Can be Proud of","Abstract":"Creating livable cities through cultural development is important not only because of the inherent value of culture itself, but also because of the social, economic, and environmental benefits afforded by communities with increased pride and attachment to places and people they share the city with. This is increasingly more critical for children and young people, as educating them to become better citizens, it also do strongly relate with development habits and their awareness of interacting with outdoor environments surrounding them. For inhabitants of cities to live an enriched life in every means, they require more than just the infrastructure and the trappings of material wealth: They require an attachment to a place, a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose, of which, a sound cultural development can help generate. Given the central government's recent emphasis in the 13th 5-year plan on encouraging creative and innovative industries, it is relevant to generate programs on cultural development focusing on younger generations. Through this, municipal governments can improve the quality of life and empower the young generation to shape the long-term prosperity of their cities. What are various ways to develop solutions based on strengthening community relations? What are the dynamics of relationship of people with each other from different social milieu? Potential discussion areas include deployment of policies such as providing grants for artists and innovators, creating tax incentives that encourage corporate social responsibility programs, and restructuring public processes to ease among different social milieu of same generation as well among different generations. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"China; landscape design; public open space; urban design and planning","Authors":"Gorgul E., Luo L., Wei S., Pei C.D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.proeng.2017.07.106","x":9.5100002289,"y":8.4399995804},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":171,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Hip-hop and the reconfiguration of Blackness in Sao Paulo: the influence of African American political and musical movements in the twentieth century","Abstract":"Hip-hop arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil in the late 1970s. During this time, African Brazilians organized meetings known as \u2018Black parties.\u2019 At Black parties, people listened to music, danced and shared Black experiences. The Black parties were greatly influenced by African-American music such as soul, funk and jazz, and contemporary socio-political movements like Civil Rights and the Black Panther Party. African Brazilians disseminated images and symbols about blackness and called for Black pride. Phrases like James Brown's \u2018Say It Loud: I'm Black and I'm Proud' were widespread. Today, hip-hop is recognized as an important influence in African-Brazilian history. The cultural exchange between Black youth in S\u00e3o Paulo and New York contributed to the reconfiguration of the Black movement in Brazil and was the vehicle by which African Brazilians acquired knowledge of the African diaspora. This essay will present three important arguments for understanding how hip-hop became a great political movement among Black youth in Brazil. My first argument is that African-American culture has provided a political language to what Paul Gilroy calls the \u2018Black universe.\u2019 This was accomplished through the public circulation of images and symbols about Black struggle. Secondly, S\u00e3o Paulo and New York, though structurally different, have similar histories in the areas of urban planning and population growth, and hip-hop had a comparable effect on marginalized communities in both cities. Finally, the cultural exchange between Black youth of S\u00e3o Paulo and New York helped change the Black movement and identity in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u00a9 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"African diaspora; Black youth; Brazilian hip-hop; Hip-hop; S\u00e3o Paulo","Authors":"Santos J.L.","DOI":"10.1080\/13504630.2015.1121573","x":7.3299999237,"y":8.2899999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":172,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Dilemmas of Identity in Contemporary Cities. the City of Gdansk as an Example","Abstract":"The article is aimed to answer the question how, depending on the historical heritage, the collective memory, the physical space of the city and their images were shaped, through the politics of memory. All known cultures and languages distinguish the 'self' and the 'other', 'us' and 'them'. Neither do we know cities which wish to differ in some particular way, although they can have numerous identities. Their multitude and diversity may be a source of conflicts or contradictions in a creating their coherent image. From a sociological perspective, all identities are constructed. The real problem, however, is how, with what, by whom, and for what? Although identities are not time-proof, in favourable circumstances, they legitimize and rationalize dominant institutions of authority and culture. The public discourse on memory and identity of the modern Gdansk is dominated by multiparadigmatism, going beyond the authenticity of the material and cultural heritage and the state of knowledge presented by historians. Metaphoric and discursive ideas, already encoded in the language, such as: Gdansk is a multicultural city; the city of freedom and the city of solidarity are used to demonstrate the multiparadigmatism. Analysis has proved that the identity narrations were built mainly on myth-making constructions, especially on the myth of 'the Golden Age'. Nowadays, the selections of architectural forms, used as a base for the Gdansk's identities, have been extending with buildings from the Polish People's Republic (1945-1989) period. Their aesthetic and historic values were, until recently, almost completely negated.

Yet such a view treats with amnesia the wealth in the elasticity of planning as an instrument for change as well as a strategic force to command and direct the trajectory of cities. It is in this context that this paper discusses the elasticity of planning of Harare as anchored on a complex but well-knit constellation of the factors of good urban governance and political will. These can allow for urban reform and smart transformation. A close look at the city after 1980 shows that the city of Harare has been subjected to much bickering, contestations and intergovernmental impositions of policy hence it exemplifies policy from above as opposed to policy from below. This is largely explained by the central government's hard and fast wrenching control in directing the affairs of the city hence negating the role of the residents' needs and wants. Recently the city has been facing several challenges, more than ever before, and the more critical challenge now is the adopted culture of colonial blaming rather that solving the deep seated problems of poor management approaches. The present study is skewed towards assessing the historical and contemporary socio-economic and political dynamics as far as they have inspired, championed, ignored, and arm-twisted planning. This has largely been to the detriment of the city. Thus, a vortex and maelstrom over the relevance of planning has been created which now requires planning to exonerate itself by proving its worthiness to the citizens and investors whose creeds and needs it has betrayed over the years. \u00a9 SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.","Author Keywords":"Colonialism; Elasticity; Governance; Spatial planning","Authors":"Chirisa I., Kawadza S.T., Muzenda A.","DOI":"10.14246\/irspsd.2.4_19","x":7.0900001526,"y":5.7100000381},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":174,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Diversity and thermal comfort in outdoor places","Abstract":"Sustainable cities should be livable cities where people from different backgrounds and with different aspirations can meet and interact with each other. Public places being the urban stages where the social interactions happen are considered important parts of cities (Thompson, 2002; Varna, 2009). They can contribute to enhance the quality of life within cities, or contrarily increase isolation and social exclusion (Lo et al., 2003). As a consequence of globalization and the development of global cities, the level of international migration has been growing in the last decades creating a plurality of different cultures in global cities and inspiring in such cities a multicultural nature (O'Byrne, 1997; Short and Kim, 1999; Hawkins, 2006). This created new challenges in urban planning or the management of the coexistence of different people that are having different characteristics that shape their unique identity and needs in the shared spaces (Sandercock, 2004). Ideally, in order to invite a diversity of users, urban outdoor places should provide significant functional and physical qualities, and accessibility to them, which induce the fulfillment of physiological, psychological and social needs (Carr et al., 1992; Jacobs, 1993; Sandholz, 2007). Users' state of comfort as stated by researchers gives a good indication for how successful is the public outdoor places (Rosheidat et al., 2008; Kwong et al., 2009; Aljawabra and Nikolopoulou, 2010). In order to create a successful open space usable by all members of a community, urban designers need to satisfy their comfort needs in its wider meaning according to a variety of different ages, genders and cultural backgrounds (Knez and Thorsson, 2006; Thorsson et al., 2007). The aim of the research is to examine the influence of culture and environmental attitude on participants' thermal requirements in outdoor public places. \u00a9 Common Ground, Inji Kenawy, Hisham ElKadi.","Author Keywords":"Diversity; Outdoor places; Thermal comfort","Authors":"Kenawy I., ElKadi H.","DOI":"10.18848\/1447-9532\/cgp\/v11i01\/38971","x":10.0100002289,"y":8.0699996948},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":176,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Asphalt bandits: Fear, insecurity, and uncertainty in the Latin American city","Abstract":"This article looks at the malandro, the bandit of Venezuela's poor neighborhoods, as a paradoxical and hybrid figure of the urban Caribbean, a virtuoso actor of the cultures of emergency and Asphalt.

Specifically, within the Yoruba ethnic group of south-western part of Nigeria. To them, the house represents a status symbol, which every member of a particular family identifies with. The pattern and form of such dwelling have played vital role in shaping and influencing the lifestyle of the people. The house to them is a place for moral and social formation as well as for physical and psychology reformation. Unfortunately, the effect and infusion of western cultural contact through civilization, technological advancement and the unfolding world order of globalization on majority of African societies and people have created loss of originality in housing forms and patterns as well as loss of cultural values of the people. This paper, which emanated from a previous resear ch by the Authors, intends to evaluate the significance of house- forms on housing quality as well as on the lifestyle of the Nigeria people. Osogbo, a traditional as well as an urbanized township was used as case study. (The findings of the research are representative of the Housing situation in most Nigerian societies). The study, which identified three (3) zones of res idential and urban development revealed a significant relationship between House-form and Housing quality within the residential districts of Osogbo. It also affirmed the predominance of the Yoruba ethnic origin over other ethnic origins in Osogbo. The paper submitted that any housing planning and de velopment that ignores the relevant socio-cultural forms and patterns would invariably lack originality and relevance to the target population. It, therefore, recommends that Government, housing planners and developers should take house-form of the different sub-cultures into consideration before embarking on future housing development.

Additionally, to define the indicators and principles that can enhance social capital within urban design context. Moreover, to suggest theoretical urban neighborhood design concept that can adopt the changing discourse of social capital. Design\/methodology\/approach: This research used the theoretical, analytical and descriptive approach-driven case study method. In all, 29 papers were analyzed to conclude the indicators that can measure social capital within the urban neighborhood design context and to conclude the required neighborhood design features and principles that influence social capital. Additionally, two new urban neighborhoods design concepts, cohousing and hybrid concepts that adopt new forms of social interaction, were studied, analyzed and then synthesized to suggest new neighborhood design concept, which is a heterotopia concept. Findings: Heterotopia neighborhood concept aims to create real, different and heterogeneous functional spaces with different layers of meanings for people from different cultures in one place. Different visible enclosures are merged into spaces of otherness while the diversity gives a sense of entering another alternative place. The heterotopias neighborhood design principles aim to create a wide variety of forms, shapes and elements [different new spaces for different ritual activities to reflect the otherness self-reflection (homogeneous and scattered spaces)] and create linkage, hierarchy, contrast and mingling between spaces and places; well-defined functional effective spaces; different fantasy and leisure spaces; high standard quality of life and otherness space; flux in social realm and fluidity of spaces; mixed use and joint experience; and innovated technologies spaces to offer strange new temporalities. Research limitations\/implications: This research recommended that different community stakeholders should participate in planning process, neighborhood urban design and decision-making process about public spaces to strengthen the community ties and achieve a heterotopia concept. Architect, urban designers and planners should adopt bottom-up design approach when designing neighborhood. Additionally, to avoid poor social capital research studies, the new researchers, practitioners and journal reviewers approaching social capital for the first time must read widely to gain an understanding of the concept from different perspectives and narrow their scope to their particular area of interest. Practical implications: This research highlights the needs for empirical studies to examine the relationships\/interrelationships between all neighborhood design principles and social capital. This might increase the knowledge on how we can design and increase the quality of neighborhood to foster social capital, which might offer interesting insights into how neighborhood urban design principles are combined to foster social capital within neighborhood context. Originality\/value: Neighborhood-based research encourages new suggesting concepts in designing every single place in the residential neighborhood in a way that can adapt the new forms of social interaction. This research scanned the current concepts of neighborhood design that concerned successfully with the changing forms of social relationships to conclude some design features and principles for neighborhood design to ensure and promote social public health and well-being. This research offers a unique perspective for better understanding the relationships between the neighborhood urban design as a spatial dimension and social capital.

There are many issues related to the integration and dialogue between cultures. Urban design plays a key role in how migrants participate in their host community and it is an important driver for the inclusion process. Facilitating the participation of residents in designing public spaces and their use helps to create a better sense of belonging. Promoting in public spaces the interaction of different cultures becomes a crucial element to facilitate social cohesion and living together. The research project explores an innovative approach in the use of public spaces, through the design of smart urban furniture. Based on a survey of the user\u2019s needs, and on co-design activities, the project investigates innovative solutions for facilitating migrants\u2019 integration and the dialogue between different cultures, through the design of innovative urban furniture, with smart technologies embodied inside. The project, based on the co-design approach of rapid prototyping, creates different kinds of new interaction among urban space and people, and between users of different social or cultural background.

In addition to situating cities within a regional context and advancing a socioecological understanding of urbanization, he viewed cities as the principal artifact of, and theater wherein, human culture evolves. This expansive view of cities may be one of the more challenging aspects of Geddes\u2019 legacy to assimilate. Working during a late 19th and early 20th century period when the limitations of modernity were becoming increasingly apparent, much of Geddes\u2019 aspirational thinking can be seen as an effort to create what he described as a \u201clarger modernism.\u201d In this regard, Geddes can be counted amongst those whom we portray as integrative holistic thinkers, people whose worldview draws them toward meaning-making narratives and frameworks that include the many dimensions of the human condition. Today, a new generation of holistic approaches called \u201cmetatheories\u201d \u2013 and \u201cintegral theory\u201d in particular \u2013 provides an orienting lens through which to review, assess, and potentially extend the work of Geddes in the 21st century.

We then assess correspondence between the two, focusing on Interdisciplinary Holism; Evolution, Development and Complex Systems; Human Agency and Ethics; and Spirituality. A closing discussion addresses prospects for future research, and suggests that the holistic, evolutionary, and generative orientation of our principal subjects may have particular relevance in an anthropogenic biosphere characterized, in part, by significant environmental challenges and the concentration of humans in cities. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Anthropocene; Anthropogenic biosphere; Cities; Integral theory; Landscape and urban planning; Metatheories; Patrick Geddes; Sociocultural evolution; Socioecological planning; Urbanization","Authors":"Eisenman T.S., Murray T.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2017.05.011","x":8.4099998474,"y":6.6900000572},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":183,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Eco-development and environmental spatial planning","Abstract":"Development is directly related to the spatial planning (regional and urban). Nowadays, humanity faces a multidimensional crisis, socio-economic crisis, cultural crisis, which is directly related to the environmental one. In the last few decades, the current development model has been questioned by international organizations and scientists of various specializations. Sustainable development or ecodevelopment approaching interdisciplinary the problem explores the exit from the socio-economic and environmental crisis. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively examine the contents of ecodevelopment and to express it in simple words, so as to be understood by people. In particular, it aims to review and clarify the concept of eco-development, defining its content in its entirety, considering it together with the role of spatial planning (regional and urban) and suggesting methods of organization of society, to provide better quality of life and achieve the exit from the crisis. A need to create a new model based on the concept of ecosystem arises from the research, where the laws of nature and culture of each place will be seriously considered in formulating development policy. A key-element for ecological spatial planning is the carrying capacity of ecosystems. The aim of spatial planning appears to be the sustainability of natural systems in order to be able to sustain and supply the anthropogenic systems, meeting the 'real' human needs. For the implementation of these and the exit from the crisis of utmost importance the role of education is highlighted in creating active citizens, who are required to undertake, through self-organization [1, 2], to promote eco-development and eco-design. \u00a9 2017 PSP.","Author Keywords":"Eco-development; Environment; Spatial planning (regional, urban)","Authors":"Lantitsou K.I.","DOI":null,"x":8.9499998093,"y":5.6100001335},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":184,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban branding and place as a quality product: innovations in the urban experience","Abstract":"Purpose: Starting from these premises, the aim of the paper is illustrating the role of experience in urban regeneration projects and to explore how the experience of high quality product luxury places can be sustainable with existent place identity or new place identity to be suitably created. Design\/methodology\/approach: The experience of a place may become an integral part of a product experience. The enhancement of products (Splendiani, 2013): assumes a meaning which goes beyond the simple sale of material goods. It covers the supply of complex experiences \u2026 enriched by intangible elements capable to stimulate and involve the sensory and experiential component of consumption. It deals with attracting people to the places where local products are made by inserting the products in the most extensive offers covering the entire territorial system of reference The experience may also be used for the spectacolarisation of a place and its commercialisation, as in the case of \u201cbrandscapes\u201d (Klingman, 2007). In this case, it is important not to clone every place everywhere because they could inevitably resemble each other without be able to really engage the people who move into them (Lehtovuori, 2010). The methodology approach is based on a wide bibliography and internet research based on the main terms connected to the topics of the paper, including experience, place identity, quality product, regeneration; on case studies \u2013 even though not illustrated \u2013 concerning places of interest for the research topics, such as: Hafencity in Hamburg, the Albert Dock in Liverpool, Abondaibarra area in Bilbao. Findings: The planning of places of quality product cannot be separated from interpretation of the territory as a cultural system resulting from an ensemble of historical, economic and social processes. In such a system, the contribution of the cultural factor must be considered propulsive, not only for its qualitative meaning but also, and especially, for the role of \u201ctrait d\u2019union\u201d of a number of actions taken to protect and enhance places.

Even though the surveys were motivated by social awareness, the result was mainly analyzed by scientific, political and economical interests, and often was devided from the cultural and psychological research of urban phenomena. However, as it is obvious that these are closely integrated, the method and idea of the urban survey reflect the bilateral relationship between perceiving and conceiving urban space. This study will explain how urban surveys transformed and reflected the ideas and interests in urban space and its study in Japan from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1980s. Especially in examining a research named \"Modernology\" by a Japanese architect Wajiro Kon from 1925 to 1930, and the works of later Japanese architects inspiered by \"Modernology\" after 1960s, this study will explain how they tried to create urban studies with cultural identity by conducting surveys and integrating with international theories. \"Modernology\"described the emerging urban space and people's way of life in Tokyo, and was often recognized as a method of popular culture. However, Modernology represented critical aspects of social space and encouraged people to be more engaged with it. While modernist architects distanced from urban realities to solve its problems scientifically, Modernology was often recognized as their counter part. When we recognize its primal objectives and influence on later generation in seeking the social ethos in the dialectical progress with the bilateral approaches between surveying and planning, we can understand the alternative aspect of Japanese urban studies. \u00a9The Author(s) 2016.","Author Keywords":"anthropology; Christopher Alexander; Design Survey; everyday phenomena; fashion; idea of urban space; Konpeito and Iryuhin Kenkyujo; lifestyle; marketing theory; Modernology; Patrick Geddes; social survey; Street Observation Society; Tokyo; visual description; Wajiro Kon","Authors":"Kuroishi I.","DOI":"10.1177\/0096144216635151","x":10.029999733,"y":7.0999999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":186,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Geo-architecture and landscape in China\u2019s geographic and historic context: Volume 4 symbolism and the language of geo-architecture","Abstract":"This book approaches the concept of geo-architecture by analyzing the symbolic characters of architectures. It proves that the relationship between architecture and geography is not merely an embodiment of physical and functional demands but rather a formal expression of the materialization of culture. After analyzing the vast number of villages, groups of buildings and individual buildings the forms of which closely resemble the forms of the Bagua (symbol of the Eight Trigrams), Taichi, animals and plants, this book finds that this kind of symbolism creatively places living and working places within the natural geographic environment and, by seeking a relationship between architecture and its surrounding environment, comes to express people\u2019s hopes and dreams, evolving slowly to take on certain cultural connotations. This book is the fourth of a 4-volume book series. The series develops the innovative concept of \u201cgeo-architecture\u201d by exploring the myriad influences of natural, human and historical factors upon architecture. These influences are considered in three categories, namely, interaction between architecture and nature, interaction between architecture and its human users and change in architecture over time--each category serves as a lens. Augmenting these lenses is the Time-Person-Place concept applied different geographic. The analysis ultimately focuses on two aspects: geographic influence on architecture and architectural response to geography.

Accessible and open to everyone, they are designed for a variety of uses where people can participate in public life. They also contribute to the collective identity of the community as they represent the culture and values of its users. In recent decades, the different ways in which public spaces are used have been the subject of studies from different disciplines including but not limited to anthropology, geography, sociology, architecture, and urban planning. It has been argued that the way in which urban life is lived and experienced changes according to demographics of its users such as age, sex, and social class.In this study, the use of public spaces based on gender differences is analyzed using space syntax methodology. The context of the study is the city center of a small Anatolian town, Balikesir, which is located in western Turkey. The methodology of the study includes a visibility analysis of the historic city center and pedestrian movement observations on the selected locations within this center. The results indicate that male users dominate the city center at all times while the density of women users is much lower, and is even lower than that of teenagers. A major contribution of this study is the finding that there is a discrepancy between the most integrated streets in terms of visibility and the most densely used ones. Given that the users of this small Anatolian town are mostly its residents, this finding suggests that for route-choice decisions,pedestrians utilize prior knowledge and experience of the city center more than the visual information provided to them via the geometry of the space. \u00a9 2014, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

In the recent idealized and abstract turn of the social sciences towards 'discourse', it has been forgotten how in their production meanings carried by symbols are precisely thrown together with material, social, and interactive circumstances. Urban ethnographers are well equipped to see the signifier not as 'free-floating' but as always engaged - through its intransigent opacities as well as its transparent relevancies - in socially situated context and social action as it finds its signified. Utilizing examples from my own ethnographic work, this article presents an urban and class-specific view of how symbols are thrown together with the circumstances of material want, social pressure, and ideological abjection suffered by young people at the bottom of social space in deprived urban areas. The struggle for survival here produces cultural forms and meanings which are no less creative and complex than the recognized formal creations of 'art' but are formed in quite different ways under pressure and compression, rather than in 'choice' and 'freedom'. \u00a9 The Author(s), 2010.","Author Keywords":"Class; Class culture; Ethnography; Method; Semiotics; Urban studies","Authors":"Willis P.","DOI":"10.1177\/1466138109347008","x":9.2100000381,"y":5.1999998093},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":193,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2009,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Toward diversity that works: Building communities through arts and culture","Abstract":"Cities, neighborhoods, college campuses, and even businesses often herald diversity-the tolerance and celebration of difference-as a selling point, making the case that it broadens perspectives, enriches lives, promotes compassion and even leads to innovation. But just what does it take to have diversity, particularly racial and ethnic diversity, in a context where racial and ethnic groups have been divided by racism, discrimination, competition for resources, and fear of change? How can tolerance and celebration of difference that leads to compassion and innovation thrive in such a context? Within urban planning and related fields, concern for fostering racial and ethnic diversity has resulted typically in attention to eradicating housing segregation and redistributing wealth and economic opportunity (Cashin 2004; De Souza Briggs 2005; Rawlings et al. 2004). While these are areas that warrant analysis and action, not enough attention has been paid to understanding or affecting the actual processes by which people express or work to change racial ethnic dynamics within and among different groups. Much of this is being achieved through arts and cultural participation. This chapter uses examples of arts and cultural activity in communities around the United States to discuss how arts and cultural activity-through which people affirm, preserve, challenge, and transform racial ethnic identity and dynamics-is a precondition for true diversity, the tolerance and celebration of difference, and how that precondition is being achieved on the ground. Based on these examples, the chapter also discusses important implications for urban planners and policymakers concerned with efforts to create more equitable and diverse communities. My ultimate argument is that, without consideration for and inclusion of arts and cultural activity, such efforts are inherently flawed. I draw in my discussion from a decade of research on the presence and roles of arts and cultural activity in many different types of communities around the United States, including moderate- and low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and immigrant communities. This research has included participant observation in cultural events, hundreds of interviews, and scores of focus group discussions with neighborhood residents, community leaders, artists, people who run cultural organizations and others involved in a range of community institutions. The research-which focuses always on the kinds of cultural activity that people value in their communities and the reasons why these are valued- is being done by the Arts and Culture in Communities Project (ACIP).1 Before launching into a discussion about how cultural participation contributes to diversity in communities, a few words are in order about how we interpret arts and culture in our work. \u00a9 2009 by Temple University Press.

This lack of interest in urban history directly reflects the emphasis on the role of the peasantry as a creative force in Chinese history.

Simultaneously, however, technological advances affecting many realms of commerce and culture have increased the necessity and desire for face-to-face contact. Ceding substantial portions of our time to the virtual realm has, curiously, enhanced the importance of local-scale, physical world interactions. In this paper we focus on an elemental concept in urban development and planning: population density. Given that individual lives are now carried out within both physical and virtual spaces, we detail the advantages for land use policy of deploying density measures that are \u201cpeople-based\u201d rather than areal based. Such metrics provide a rich perspective reflecting planning-relevant geographies of spatial interaction. Rather than restricting density calculation to pre-specified areal units, such as municipalities, neighborhoods, census tracts, city blocks, or land parcels, we propose the deployment of \u201cperceived\u201d density surfaces that yield point-specific values for a set of bespoke values operationalizing critically relevant time-distance thresholds. We suggest embedding walking density, cycling density, and auto-travel density into the formulation and evaluation of land use decisions. In addition to being useful for many practical purposes, threshold-based perceived density provides an interesting conceptual framework for examining how individuals experience and interact within a spectrum of surrounding, microcosmic world spaces. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Activity patterns; Land use policy; Physical versus virtual spaces; Population density; Time geography","Authors":"Plane D.A., Mu W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2020.104462","x":8.8800001144,"y":6.9400000572},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":197,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Using decision support system to enable crowd identify neighborhood issues and its solutions for policy makers: An online experiment at kabul municipal level","Abstract":"Planning a city is a systematic process that includes time, space, and groups of people who must communicate. However, due to security problems in such war-ravaged countries as Afghanistan, the traditional forms of public participation in the planning process are untenable. In particular, due to gathering space difficulties and culture issues in Afghanistan, women and religious minorities are restricted from joining male-dominated powerholders\u2019 face-to-face meetings which are nearly always held in fixed places called masjids (religious buildings). Furthermore, conducting such discussions with human facilitation biases the generation of citizen decisions that stimulates an atmosphere of confrontation, causing another decision problem for urban policy-making institutions. Therefore, it is critical to find approaches that not only securely revolutionize participative processes but also provide meaningful and equal public consultation to support interactions among stakehold-ers to solve their shared problems together. Toward this end, we propose a joint research program, namely, crowd-based communicative and deliberative e-planning (CCDP), a blended approach, which is a mixture of using an artificial-intelligence-led technology, decision-support system called D-Agree and experimental participatory planning in Kabul, Afghanistan. For the sake of real-world implementation, Nagoya Institute of Technology (Japan) and Kabul Municipality (Afghanistan) have formed a novel developed and developing world partnership by using our proposed methodology as an emerging-deliberation mechanism to reframe public participation in urban planning processes. In the proposed program, Kabul municipality agreed to use our methodology when Kabul city needs to make a plan with people. This digital field study presents the first practical example of using online decision support systems in the context of the neighborhood functions of Gozars, which are Kabul\u2019s social and spatial urban units. The main objective was to harness the wisdom of the crowd to innovative suggestions for helping policymakers making strategic development plans for Gozars using open call ideas, and for responding to equal participation and consultation needs, specifically for women and minorities. This article presents valuable insights into the benefits of this combined approach as blended experience for societies and cities that are suffering long-term distress. This initiative has influenced other local Afghan governments, including the cities of Kandahar and Herat as well as the country\u2019s central government\u2019s ministry of urban planning and land, which has officially expressed its intention to collaborate with us. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Ecosystem management; Municipal government; Nature-based solutions; Q-method; Urban forest governance; Urban planning","Authors":"Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez C., Kendal D., Threlfall C.G., Hochuli D.F., Davern M., Fuller R.A., van der Ree R., Livesley S.J.","DOI":"10.3390\/f11090963","x":7.0999999046,"y":6.75},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":199,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Indigenous placemaking and the built environment: toward transformative urban design","Abstract":"This paper examines how the design and programming of the built environment of settler cities have contributed to the invisibility of Indigenous peoples and minimizing their cultural influence.

Urban planning should concentrate on an organic relationship between people and their living spaces. The city is a product of Earth, a fact of nature, man\u2019s method of expression, Mumford writes in his The Culture of Cities (first edition in 1938). This also means that both the designer and the user must have a high degree of creativity in order to design and utilise the built environment. By analysing the definition of the city Mumford examines its changes during history from ancient times to recent planning method. He criticises the most dominant design processes of the 20th century: the functionalist and mechanical urban design. He is an advocate of the organic method in planning and understanding cities. The organic approach requires an active and creative approach as opposed to mere passive reception. This organic approach by Mumford to understanding cities is based on the theory of Kevin A. Lynch. We may distinguish 3 normative ways of city planning theory: (1) the cosmic, (2) the mechanic and (3) the organic model. In my paper I will first apply the onion model of culture developed by Geert Hofstede for the city and its analysis, and also for the appearance of creativity in them. After that I am going to examine the city with a special, architectural based mind map theory: the five elements by Lynch. Lynch suggests that these five elements (paths, edges, districts, nodes, landmarks) create the mental map for readability. Finally, I will investigate a usage of mental map in modern city planning (Le Corbusier) and works on the process of \u201cdebabelisation\u201d (Otto Neurath). \u00a9 2018 The Author(s).","Author Keywords":"City planning; Creativity; Hofstede; Lynch; Mental map; Urban design; Visual argumentation","Authors":"J\u00e1sz B.","DOI":"10.3846\/cs.2018.6901","x":8.9300003052,"y":6.3899998665},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":207,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Sustainable social innovations in smart cities: Exploratory analysis of the current global situation applicable to Colombia","Abstract":"In the current world most of the population is concentrated in urban areas, where people receive their education, work and leisure activities. Therefore, many challenges have appeared in cities all over the world related to growth, over- population, urban planning, quality of services, competitiveness, environmental factors and citizenship values, which have become main priorities of the managers and mayors of these cities. The Smart City concept emerges as a paradigm that aims to solve these problems and challenges, by developing policies, infrastructure, ser- vices and public awareness programs that will transform today cities, for example a future self-sustaining innovation, growth, technological development, civic and ethical citizenship and social progress. This study presents an exploratory analysis in respect of the current global situation related to the concept of Smart City, com- paring the different essential definitions and dimensions described in recent litera- ture by cited authors and related to the nomenclature of the term. The effects, challenges and opportunities that Smart Cities can offer to their citizens, has been presented, for example in different programs, projects and initiatives, that cities all over the world have implemented, focusing on sustainable social innovations, eco- nomic growth, environmental protection, quality of life, participatory governance, social and community development, citizenship education, efficient urban mobility, tourism services, health and safety. The situation in Bogota and Medellin, the two main cities of Colombia have been reviewed and studied in this work, the aspects previously mentioned have been taken into account to establish a new definition of the Smart City concept. To perform this task, a set of six dimensions and 27 subcat- egories are essential to define and measure this concept in the Colombian paradigm, which can be used to monitor the current status, in order to approximate evaluations of Colombian cities to the qualification concept described as the Smart City. Due to the lack of studies observed in this work, further research must be focused, not only on getting more data from Bogota and Medellin, but also having the opportunity to observe the situation in other important cities such as Barranquilla, Cali, Bucaramanga or Cartagena, currently no data is available. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

It is usually evaluated based on how loud the urban environment is. However, this approach does not consider people's perception of the urban acoustic environment. Therefore, a different method has been developed based on the perception of the acoustic environment using the concept of soundscape. Soundscape is defined as the acoustic environment perceived by people who are part of the environment. This approach considers the relationship between the sound source, the environment, and the people. The analysis of soundscape considers many aspects such as cultural aspects, people's expectations, people's experience of space, and social aspects. Soundscape affects many aspects of human life such as culture, health, and the quality of life. Urban soundscape management and planning must be integrated with the other aspect of urban design, both in the design and the improvement stages. The soundscape concept seeks to make the acoustic environment as pleasant as possible in a space with or without uncomfortable sound sources. Soundscape planning includes the design of physical features to achieve a positive perceptual outcome. It is vital to gather data regarding the relationship between humans and the components of a soundscape, e.g., sound sources, features of the physical environment, the functions of a space, and the expectation of the sound source. The data can be measured and gathered using several soundscape evaluation methods. Soundscape evaluation is usually conducted using in-situ surveys and laboratory experiments using a multi-speaker system. Although these methods have been validated and are widely used in soundscape analysis, there are some limitations in the application. The in-situ survey needs to be done at one time with many people at the same time because it is hard to replicate the acoustic environment. Conversely, the laboratory experiment does not have a problem with the repetition of the experiment. This method requires a room with a multi-speaker reproduction system. This project used a different method to analyse soundscape developed using headphones via the internet. The internet system for data gathering has been established; a website has enabled to reproduce high-quality audio and it has a system to design online questionnaires. Furthermore, the development of a virtual reality system allows the reproduction of virtual audio-visual stimulus on a website. Although the website has an established system to gather the required data, the problem is the validation of the reproduction system for soundscape analysis, which needs to be done with consideration of several factors: the suitable recording system, the effect of headphone variation, the calibration of the system, and the perception result from internet-based acoustic environment reproduction. This study aims to develop and validate a web-based urban soundscape evaluation method. By using this method, the experiment can be repeated easily and data can be gathered from many respondents. Furthermore, the simplicity of the system allows for the application by the stakeholders in urban design. The data gathered from this system is important for the design of an urban area with consideration of the acoustic aspects. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sudarsono A.S., Sarwono J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1755-1315\/158\/1\/012052","x":11.5900001526,"y":6.75},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":209,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"'Auraldiversity': Defining a hearing- centred perspective to socially equitable design of the built environment","Abstract":"Historically, sound, soundscape and human hearing have collectively received litt le att ention in the design of urban spaces and places, particularly with regards to the psychological and sociological impact of hearing on the experience of individuals in the built environment. It is proposed that the sonic considerations which have been made in urban design are commonly developed within an assumption of otologically normal hearing, and, more broadly, without the acknowledgement of the actual diversity in people's auditory and sensory abilities. Existing considerations of sound and hearing within inclusive design research, particularly in the built environment, are grounded in an 'auraltypical' perspective where the primary focus is hearing individuals or those with hearing loss. This position supposes to some degree that an idealized otological profi le and consistent model of hearing profi ciency is shared amongst all citizens and engenders a culture of urban design driven by 'good\/bad' ears and homogenized sonic interaction. This paper introduces the theoretical paradigm of 'auraldiversity' - an emerging agenda that acknowledges the diversity of human hearing and the multitude of elements that place the hearing modality within a state of constant fl ux. The paper situates this theoretical perspective within the context of the built environment through the mapping of three 'auraldivergent' hearing profi les. Each profi le charts the lived sonic experiences of a d\/Deaf or disabled individual in the built environment. The paper concludes by positioning the auraldiversity paradigm as a catalyst in the development of a hearing-centred approach to inclusive design research, a new agenda where the opportunity for more socially and sonically equitable design of the built environment is established. \u00a9 2018 Ingenta.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Renel W.","DOI":"10.2148\/benv.44.1.36","x":11.6599998474,"y":6.6199998856},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":210,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Rural Design Ethics Based on Four Dimensions","Abstract":"China has a large rural area with a large population, whose architectural features, natural landscape, organizational structure and industrial structure are very different from that of cities. In the past, the contradictory between city and rural areas in China had negative effects on rural construction, resulting in a slow development. The excessive focus on city design has led to the neglect of rural design. Blindly using the concept and method of city design to renewed the countryside is a kind of destruction to the countryside, and also wastes a lot of construction resources. Design is influenced by ethical concepts, which needs to pay more attention to the culture tendency and society. Urban design makes theoretical investigation aiming at the ethical questions that emerged from city, then summarizes the design strategies of the city. While Chinese rural design has only begun to enter people's horizon, and there is very little discussion about it. Due to the lack of ethical value guidance, Chinese rural design and construction has many problems at different levels of ecology, culture and industry.

Notes on the social conditions for cultural production in contemporary economy","Abstract":"Purpose: This paper discusses the social conditions for cultural production in contemporary cities, in the context of a globalized economy, with rising importance of the integration of cognitive, symbolic and emotional elements into tradable products and services. Although the agglomeration dynamics of creative activities in urban contexts and the social or spatial inequalities related to processes of urban reorganization in Post-Fordist societies have been analysed in the last years, the interrelations between these aspects still lack adequate investigation and empirical analysis. Methodology\/Approach: By synthetizing diverse theoretical contributions related to different levels and interactions arising from creative activities, their transformations into tradable products (commodification) and some of their spatial implications in the urban context (agglomeration, externalities, identity, place branding and gentrification), the article emphasizes the different benefits obtained by the agents involved in this process, potentially contributing for increasing social conflicts and to a process of cultural homogenization with negative implications on the uniqueness and authenticity of places. Findings: Benefits arising from the externalities generated by the agglomeration of cultural production and creative activities can be framed within the \u201cCommon Pool of Resources\u201d approach, suggesting that a more balanced share of the benefits can be obtained by means of participatory processes for city planning and development.

Within environmental history, Mumford has been treated mostly as a regionalist - sometimes even as an opponent of the city. This essay argues that in fact his path toward ecological \"balance\" led directly through the city, not out of it. Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic \"renewal\" but also as a landscape full of what he called \"remnants\" and \"persistents\"; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. \u00a9 2016 The Author.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sachs A.","DOI":"10.1093\/envhis\/emw034","x":8.5799999237,"y":6.5700001717},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":214,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Analysis of new urban planning based on green ecological economics","Abstract":"With the development of social economy, the urbanization of the world has presented a new development trend.

Up until the thirteenth century Rossio was a barren area outside the walls of the medieval city and was used as a common space where people held ceremonies for 500 years. The Rossio also connected inland rural area with the city within the walls, acting as a bridge between those two worlds. For this reason Rossio has always been a space for all kind of vendors, outsiders, beggars and social rejects, while also a route into the city for agrarian culture, rituals and people. Despite the attempts by the city\u2019s masters and the Crown to seize the space for the construction of their institutions, it was not until the 1755 earthquake that this finally happened. The reconstruction of Lisbon under the gaze of the enlightened rationalist Marquis of Pombal represented the beginning of a new era for the city: giving birth to the modern bourgeois city, in which the historical organization of space was reshaped, the Rossio\u2019s traditional functions displaced and the meaning and contents of the hegemonic city representations and imaginaries such as fado music and the annual People\u2019s Saints (Santos Populares) celebrations renewed. In this article, the centrality of Rossio is reviewed, with a stress on the displacement of some of its attributes to the districts after the earthquake by the romantic heritage processes of meaning. However, the Rossio maintained some of its traditional functions, with the daily presence there of African migrants as an example. \u00a9 2015 Intellect Ltd Dossier.","Author Keywords":"1755 earthquake; Heritage; Lisbon; Pra\u00e7a do Rossio; Urban planning; Urban processes","Authors":"Malet Calvo D.","DOI":"10.1386\/pjss.14.2.123_1","x":8.6599998474,"y":4.9699997902},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":216,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Swettenham pier waterfront redevelopment, Penang","Abstract":"A waterfront is a place where life of a city bloomed. Water is the source of life. Life is the practice of living. A waterfront signified a city's growth, bounded by water. Swettenham Pier is one part of Penang Island's east coast waterfront link, and happened to be at the sport where Georgetown started. The spot where in history, Sir Francis Light landed on this island and where Georgetown is established along with the blooming of international entrepot activities. It was glorious back in the late 80's. The main objective of this thesis is to bring back the glory moment of Swettenham Pier, giving back the waterfront to the people of Georgetown, people of Penang. Having to attend to this said aim, the redevelopment of Swettenham Pier waterfront is to give a chance to the people to claim a part of this waterfront, for living, for leisure or for any unplanned activities, as to establish its aim to contribute back to the local people, local culture and local living. This call for a strategy to design a waterfront to revive the history, while injecting new life to the place for people and activities to be carry on care freely. The design potential of this project is to look through the entire master plan of the waterfront and then move into the micro elements that support the entire scheme. The master plan plays a crucial role in supporting the waterfront with various types of activities that serve various demographics of users. The redevelopment of the new cruise terminal would also be explored thoroughly in conjunction with Penang Structure Plan in order to come out with the design that could cope with future development.

Since the 1960s, a considerable part of urban culture has attempted to develop strategies for people to re-appropriate public space and to 'inhabit the city again.' This has defined a line of research that, although now consolidated, is still little known in its complexity. In the effort to create a unified framework for the different attempts through which architecture has historically responded to the rise of spontaneous forms of urban creativity, this paper outlines a short history of design strategies aimed at enabling and encouraging different forms of spatial appropriation. It also highlights a gradual shift from prescriptive and repeatable rules to site-specific approaches, prompting a new disciplinary convergence between urban planning and design, interior architecture, industrial design and public art. \u00a9 Authors and Editors - Lisbon, November 2015.","Author Keywords":"Interior architecture; Public spaces; Spatial appropriation; Urban design","Authors":"Leveratto J.","DOI":null,"x":8.6400003433,"y":7.7399997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":219,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Human sensory assessment linked with geo-and mobile-data processing methods in urban planning exemplified on different cultures in Germany and Egypt","Abstract":"Human sensory assessment is a new approach to objectively gather subjec-tive data concerning humans' perception of space and emotional reactions towards space in real-time.

It comments on several examples of planned artistic interventions and, in particular, analyses a recent major project of urban design in Concepcion, the third largest city in Chile. An environmental vision, that addresses itself to the contemporary city's development, has also to consider that urban spaces should provide adequate venues for leisure and civic entertainment for the inhabitant. Historically, the notion of art has been associated with the degree of culture of society and, indeed, it represents the expression and spirit of our urban communities. Hence, together with the macro-planning goals of development, there exists a chance to restore people's sense of belonging and pride of place, providing adequate spaces related to artistic manifestations that can contribute to the overall quality of life in neighbourhoods and inner city areas. The conclusions suggest that these types of artistic expression can be a key factor, but only by integration, that is a combination of an appropriate scale of intervention through urban design, rather than 'parachuting' the art into different places. \u00a9 1997 E. & EN Spon.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Cartes I.","DOI":"10.1057\/udi.1997.31","x":8.720000267,"y":7.7399997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":224,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":1991,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Space as a resource","Abstract":"At the micro level of a shelter programme, space is the most important commodity, which needs to be optimally used not only for upgrading the immediate and overall environment but also for reasons of the economics, finance, life style, tradition and culture of the people who are expected to live there.

Furthermore, over the past 10 years, we have not reduced the difference between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Therefore, the extension of healthy life expectancy and the development of a healthy society are the most urgent issues. In terms of medical care, the changing times have inevitably led to changes in disease structures and medical demands; therefore, the medical delivery system has had to be changed to meet these demands. As dementia rapidly increases, it is important to address \u201cfrailty,\u201d a condition in which people become more vulnerable to environmental factors as they age, and there is a need to provide services to older people, particularly the old-old, that emphasize quality of life in addition to medical care. To realize a super-aged society that will remain vigorous and vibrant for many years, we need to rethink the future of Japanese medicine and healthcare, and the state of society. Current situation and problems: Disparity between healthy life expectancy and average life expectancy in the realization of a healthy society It is a challenge to build a society with a long and healthy life expectancy through comprehensive prevention and management of lifestyle-related diseases, as well as the elucidation of the factors that explain sex differences in healthy life expectancy, based on the recognition that lifestyle-related diseases in midlife are risk factors for frailty and dementia in old age. Challenges in medical care for building a super-aged and healthy society The challenges include promoting clinical guidelines suitable for older people, including lifestyle-related disease management, promoting comprehensive research on aging (basic research, clinical research and community collaboration research), and embodying a paradigm shift from \u201ccure-seeking medical care\u201d to \u201ccure- and support-seeking medical care.\u201d Furthermore, the key to the future of integrated community care is the development of a comprehensive medical care system for older people in each region and the development of the next generation of medical personnel. Dissemination of frailty prevention measures in a super-aged society The concept of frailty encompasses the meaning of multifacetedness and reversibility; therefore, a comprehensive approach is required, including the renewal of conventional prevention activities in each region, such as the nutritional status of older people, physical activity including exercise, and various opportunities for social participation and participation conditions. Challenges of an unstable diet and undernutrition in older people According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of Japan, energy and protein intakes are low in Japanese people aged \u226575 years; particularly in people aged \u226580 years, low and insufficient intake of nutrients are prominent. Undernutrition in older people is increasing and is more pronounced in women. There are multiple factors behind this, including social factors, such as living alone, eating alone, poverty and other social factors, as well as problems with access to food security. Pharmacotherapy for older people: measures against polypharmacy In addition to the problems of adverse drug events, drug interactions, duplication of effects and the presence of drugs that \u201crequire particularly careful administration,\u201d it is also necessary to take measures against polypharmacy in older people, as well as medical economic issues, such as high drug costs and large amounts of remaining drugs. Barriers to this measure include multiple medical institution visits for each disease, lack of coordination between professions, and lack of understanding by patients and families. Role of local communities in a healthy society The decline in the working-age population is also a major challenge; however, we need to make a shift to use this declining birthrate and aging population as an opportunity rather than a crisis. As we look ahead to the coming of the 100-year age of life, we rethink the creation of a comprehensive society and community, and aim to create an age-free society where everyone can play an active role and live in peace, regardless of age. Contents of the proposal: In this report, we have put together a vision for the future of an aging Japanese society from a broader perspective of how the environment and local communities should be, rather than simply from the perspective of individual health. We aim to convey this proposal to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the Cabinet Office, and various professional organizations. The paradigm shift from \u201ccure-seeking medical care\u201d to \u201ccure- and support-seeking medical care\u201d should be promoted for the development of a healthy society While further promoting pre-emptive medical care in the medical care for older people, the development of multidisciplinary medical guidelines appropriate for older people should be promoted at the same time. In addition, we should promote basic aging research, clinical research (including the long-term care field) and transitional research that cover regional areas. Furthermore, while promoting the paradigm shift from \u201ccure-seeking medical care\u201d to \u201ccure- and support-seeking medical care,\u201d the development of various comprehensive medical treatment systems for older people and the strengthening of integrated community care systems should be promoted. Development of the next generation of medical personnel to comprehensively deal with geriatric care, including training geriatric specialists, should be promoted As the number of older people with multimorbidities and frailty rapidly increases in the future, we should promote the development of the next generation of medical personnel who can comprehensively handle medical care for older people, including training leading geriatricians in cooperation with multiple professions in the integrated community care system to provide sufficient medical care. Countermeasures for frailty in older people should be promoted from medical and community planning perspectives To address frailty, which requires comprehensive evaluation and intervention, the three pillars of frailty prevention (nutrition, exercise and social participation) should be incorporated and addressed as part of community development within each municipality, taking into account local characteristics. In particular, it is necessary to revise the way of thinking about nutrition management in older people and the guidelines of the societies in the field. In addition, it is important to strengthen industry\u2013academia\u2013government\u2013private partnerships in each region, taking into account not only medical issues, but also social factors, and encourage the development of momentum in the entire region regarding measures against undernutrition in older people. Polypharmacy measures should be promoted in pharmacotherapy for older people It is necessary to promote cooperation between physicians and pharmacists, establish other multiprofessional cooperation systems, and develop medical and long-term care insurance systems to support this. It is also essential to change the public's mindset, and awareness-raising activities at all levels are required, including the enhancement of educational materials for medical caregivers and the general public. In addition, the economic impact of healthcare using big data should be timely clarified. Innovation in medical and urban planning perspectives should be promoted In the future, it will be necessary to modify and update multidisciplinary approaches such as social participation (e.g. participation in a salon) with a view to innovation in both medical care and community development, especially on the idea of a symbiotic community. In addition, industry\u2013academia\u2013government\u2013private partnership is necessary, including all aforementioned, such as places where people can play an active role in the rest of their lives (such as employment), promotion of human connections, promotion of technology to support older people and support for daily life.

It is imperative to harness the latent potential of existing settlements for an inclusive smart urban development. The study aims to assess the socio-cultural attributes of an Indian historic urban landscape with a thriving residential culture. Since data collection of neighborhood-level urban communities is not feasible in India, a structured questionnaire was used to conduct household surveys. Such real-world phenomena have inherent imprecision and ambiguity associated with human judgments. Therefore, the survey items are assumed as fuzzy linguistic variables, and the raw dataset is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy arithmetic and weighted averaging operators are applied for the hierarchical evaluation of indicators and variables. A robust algorithm is used for the dimension reduction of a fuzzy coded dataset while dealing with subjective responses. The aggregated fuzzy scores show an overall better performance of traditional communities with respect to their socio-cultural attributes, such as a sense of safety and collective efficacy. The application of fuzzy logic in urban planning and allied behavioral studies can effectively and pragmatically deal with the inherent uncertainties in a humanistic system.

While the subjectivity view is commonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of subsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion of beauty\u2014structural beauty\u2014among people and even different peoples, regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a physical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based on the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To verify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight pairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock\u2019s Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies that goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an opinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision, architecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and psychology. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The local neighbourhood is very important to understand how people conceive the city in their minds. The representative memory captures the elements related to spatial identity of a place, but more often than not, these representations are pictorial images superimposed upon the fabric resulted from the standardized tools used for analysing the spatial qualities and its attributes. The recognition of the finding to capture elements related to experiences of spatial identity problematizes from well-established urban design spatial theories. On the other hand, Indian city is a collective of people, place and events. These neighbourhoods may not be central to social or business relationships nor centre for historic monuments, but the activities, users, events, location and spatial conditions that support them are very different\u2014together key to the legibility of the city. More often than not, the impacts due to the city\u2019s regeneration process sustain the test of time and manifest into a deeper system for building an image of the place. Hence, embedded meaning and meaningful association over time become crucial for the built morphology. One such neighbourhood is Pettah1\u2014the old core of city of Bangalore. Bengaluru was one of the key trading centres of the south during the pre-colonial era. The idea of a town structured around Pettah (market), Kote2 (fort), Kere3 (lakes and tanks) and Totha4 (gardens and parks) was an unquestionable matrix of natural occurrences and cultural practices. Decades to follow many influences on to the town added a layer of new structure, and every stage of progress enunciated the past with a new skin of elements. It is this value of city\u2019s memory that lie buried within us carrying forward our past into its present fabric. Hence, the study reveals the need to radically departure from the routines of recording legibility and imageability through mental, sensory and visual mapping and to record in terms of space, events, time, activities as well as sense of public-ness. Ultimately, the findings also brings optimism into urban design practice, offering new insight into how to record mosaic of an area in an Indian city that will capture the strong perceived and conceived imagery of a place and hence sensitive responsive proposals that will aid to carefully conceive a system for the future. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Author Keywords":"Character; Culture; Elusive; Morphology; Neighbourhood","Authors":"Bydar Shubhashchandra S., Subramanian R.R.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-51961-2_18","x":7.6300001144,"y":4.9299998283},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":230,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Where do you live and what do you drive: Built-environmental and spatial effects on vehicle type choice and vehicle use","Abstract":"The carbon footprint of daily travel for an individual household is based on the types of vehicles that the household owns, their fuel efficiency, and the number of miles traveled (Federal Highway Administration, 2009). Therefore, the types and usage of vehicles a household owns are informational to overall sustainable planning. This study develops a multinomial logit model for vehicle type choice and a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model for vehicle use for Ohio households using the most recent Household Travel Survey (HTS) collected in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The developed vehicle choice model identifies the effects of the built environment characteristics on vehicle type based on vehicle size, controlling for socio-economic attributes. People residing in neighborhoods characterized with higher densities in population, employment, and intersection and with fewer single detached housing are more likely to own smaller vehicles as compared to the ones living in suburban areas.

Studies conducted by the 'Roselectromontazh' Association have shown a significant difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity, which is further confirmed by the reports of electric grid companies. In some cases, there is a 3-fold difference. This occurs due to the emergence of a sustainable culture of electricity consumption and the use of highly energy-efficient devices. In 2019, the results of the research work were taken into account in the regional urban planning standards of the Republic of Tatarstan. On average, the normative values have been reduced by 2 times. This enabled a significant reduction in the difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity. From 2020 onwards, leading construction companies in the Republic of Tatarstan are applying up-to-date values to decrease utility services' construction costs. For power grid companies the savings consist of reduction of electrical energy losses and 'locked electrical capacity' and the elimination of inefficient investments. It is important to note that specific values of electrical load were calculated taking into account summer and winter peaks in order to exclude the emergencies.

Drawing on over 15 years of ethnographic research, the book explores the impact of rapid urbanisation and modernisation on contemporary Thai youth, focusing on conspicuous youth subcultures, drug use (especially methamphetamine use), and violent youth gangs. Anjalee Cohen shows how young Thai people construct a specific youth identity through consumerism and symbolic boundaries \u2013 in particular through enduring rural\/urban distinctions. The suggestion is that the formation of subcultures and \u201cdeviant\u201d youth practices, such as drug use and violence, are not necessarily forms of resistance against the dominant culture, nor a pathological response to dramatic social change, as typically understood in academic and public discourse. Rather, Cohen argues that such practices are attempts to \u201cfit in and stick out\u201d in an anonymous urban environment. This volume is relevant to scholars in Thai Studies, Southeast Asian Studies, Anthropology, Sociology, Urban Studies, and Development Studies, particularly those with an interest in youth, drugs, and gangs. \u00a9 2020 Anjalee Cohen.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Cohen A.","DOI":"10.4324\/9781351127745","x":9.0399999619,"y":9.0200004578},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":236,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"The role of social and cultural interaction between Russian and Chinese students in changing the educational space of the Russian University","Abstract":"Students as a special social group can be considered as a guide of interaction between the partner countries of Russia and China as representatives of different cultures and different mentalities. Interaction between Russian and Chinese universities in the scientific and educational sphere has specific features and reflects the general mechanisms of functioning in social and cultural environment. The socio-cultural context of such interaction is the life activity of megalopolis, regional features and it is related to the socio-cultural traditions of people relationship. The general purpose of the study was to identify changes in interaction between Russian and Chinese students studying in a Russian University. The study conducted in Russian and Chinese Universities. The research methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The primary data was collected using questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Three hundred and ninety respondents - Russian students and five hundred respondents - Chinese students, were questioned on the basis of quota sampling. Depths interviews were conducted with 20 experts. The study has revealed some actual issues and tendencies of social interaction in the educational sphere. It has a temporal character and it is developed in a single educational environment of universities-partners of Russia and China. The study has identified the structure of social interaction, consisting of five levels: 1. At the level of connectivity, social relations between social and ethnic groups (in this case, Russian and Chinese students) are established on the basis of their values. 2. At the level of translation, understanding of the values of another (different) culture through the interpretation of cultural codes (cultural signs) takes place. 3. At the level of transcendence, transition from one's cultural system to another, the development of positive experience and knowledge of another cultural system take place. 4. At the level of adaptation, an interiorization, application in behaviour and activity of values of other cultural system take place. 5. At the level of inter cultural dialogue, an organization of effective and fruitful cooperation between social and ethnic groups and their representatives based on an understanding of the universal values takes place. The five levels of social interaction identified by researches in the joint educational environment of Russian and Chinese universities allow not only to find out the content components of the structure of social and cultural interaction, but also to consider its dynamics and development. Our research has identified a set of factors that affect the functioning of the interaction between Russian and Chinese students structure: geopolitical situation, cost and quality of education, adaptation of training courses for foreigners, comfort of the educational environment of University, the complexity of learning of the host country language, the prestige of education. This model of interaction between social and ethnic groups of Russian and Chinese students being representatives of partner universities is confirmed by the real practice of scientific and educational cooperation between Russian and Chinese universities. Joint forms of University work have been successfully tested and activities that have become events of inter cultural dialogue have been organized. \u00a9 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Contemporary City as Adaptable Hybrid","Abstract":"Global space - both natural and cultural - is the greatest good belonging to the human community. The said community has, therefore, the right and responsibility to protect it, wisely and in solidarity, from wasteful exploitation. The postulate of public utility of this good must also presume such mutual conditioning of the rights and obligations of private owners that would minimise the chance of their infringement of collective interests. The culture of space management became an important measure of cultural level of societies at the turn of the 20th century, perhaps one of those moments which decide upon the future of our civilisation. The conclusion that large agglomerations in particular are \"incorrigible zones of spatial and social pathology, from which we need to escape into pristine areas and there create a more perfect living environment\" is unacceptable, also from the ethical point of view, both as regards the people living in those agglomerations and nature. As far as what has been created by man is concerned, we need to assume that we are able to control and improve this material creation of our civilisation. Such is the fundamental requirement of sustainable development - a difficult, but probably the only way of managing \"the global village\" in the millennium that has just commenced. The spatial structure of the contemporary city as a whole is a broken form: it has formally expressive and perfectly composed elements, it has mutilated compositions, chaotic arrangements and \"lost spaces\", finally, it has spaces that as yet have not been properly used compositionally and are still waiting for their role in the whole. A broken form - in compliance with the principle of irreversibility - may not return to its original composition. Thinking about the future of the city and taking into account the irrefutable fact that a considerable part of the built environment of tomorrow already exists today, we should ask ourselves the question: can it adopt, as a whole, a composition of a different kind? If the urbanised environment, being the basic one, is also to become a full-value environment for human existence, it will require continuous and universal improvement of its quality, as well as new strategies, methods and scenarios for rational organisation of urbanised space that will be able to meet new challenges. It seems that \"dramaturgically consistent logic of composition\" may become an original formula of urban public space. Scenarios built on the basis of the city \"genotype\", in which urban \"layers of memory\" are the basis for adaptive transformations. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Franta A.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/9\/092030","x":9.220000267,"y":5.6599998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":239,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Overview of relevant regional culture studies (the Krasnoyarsk krai): Challenges and approaches","Abstract":"This article presents the results of the analysis of relevant regional culture studies.

It engages with both urban and conservation issues and and compares four national parks located in four large cities in the global South: Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Mumbai, and Nairobi. Though primarily undertaken as academic research, the project has intensively collaborated with the institutions in charge of these parks. The comparative structure of this volume is also original and unique: each of the chapters incorporates insight from all four sites as far as possible.The term \"naturbanity\" expresses the necessity for cities endowed with a national park to integrate it into their functioning. Conversely, such parks must take into account their location in an urban environment, both as a source of heavy pressures on nature and as a nexus of incentives to support their conservation. The principle of non-exclusivity, that is, neither the city nor the park has a right nor even the possibility to negate the other's presence, summarizes the main argument of this book. Naturbanity thus blurs the old \"modern\" dichotomy of nature\/culture: animals and human beings can often jump the physical and ideological walls separating many parks from the adjacent city. The 13 chapters and substantive introduction of this volume discuss various aspects of naturbanity: the histories of park creation; interaction between people and parks; urban governance and parks; urban conservation models; wildlife management; environmental education; and so on. This is a must-read for students and researchers interested in social ecology, social geography, conservation, urban planning and ecological policy. \u00a9 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

Sustainability is regarded as a governing principle of contemporary architecture, where daylighting is an important factor as it affects energy consumption and environmental quality of the space inside a building. Environmental awareness of architecture, however, involves a much wider and more holistic view of design. The quality of sustainable architecture can be considered in its aesthetic and cultural context with regard to landscape, local tradition, and connection to the surrounding world. This approach is associated with the social mission of architecture, i.e. providing appropriate space for living, facilitating social relations and having positive impact on people. The purpose of the research is to study the use of daylight in creating an aesthetic image of contemporary buildings. The author focuses mainly on public buildings largely dedicated to art and culture which satisfy high functional and aesthetic requirements. The paper examines the genesis and current trends in the aesthetic image of modern buildings which use daylight as the main design strategy, focusing on the issues of glass facades. The main attention is given to the shaping of representative public areas which feature the glass facades. The research has been based on a case study, critical review of literature review, observation and synthesis. The study identifies and classifies different approaches to using daylight in these areas and highlights changes in the aesthetics of architecture made of glass, which uses daylight as the main design strategy. These changes are primarily caused by the development and spreading of new glazing materials and the use of digital method of design. The influence of light and its mode depends on glass materials but also on the local conditions of the site, and has a significant impact on the relationship between architecture and its natural and cultural environment. The subordination of architectural concept to the idea of natural lighting builds the relationship between form, function and the context of architecture, and is expressed in its structural, material and spatial properties, and in the resulting aesthetic order. Search for new architectural solutions is defined by local topographical, climatic, biological and cultural conditions. The architecture subordinate to the conception of contribution of light corresponds to the aesthetic aspirations of sustainability. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Roginska-Niesluchowska M.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/245\/8\/082035","x":9.6199998856,"y":5.3899998665},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":247,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Modality environments: A concept for sustainability and vitality in the multi-modal city","Abstract":"This paper reviews an idea of vital local high-street places with their walking spaces and economies founded in interfaces between neighbourhood and city (between walking and public transport\/bicycle movement infrastructures). It then extends this idea to higher scales, considering interfaces between city and region, which have already been theorised as 'mobility environments' (Bertolini & Dijst 2003) focusing on places and modal transfer points in new regional cities of high mobility. High-streets and mobility environments are both central places and our way of describing them suggests a new definition of central places as interfaces between normative (but also technically-infrastructually supported) political spaces (neighbourhood, city and region). It also clarifies the role of scale in place theory and we will deal with this in a following paper. Here we introduce ideas of 'modality places' and 'modality environments'. The 'modality environment' is concerned with areal and network transportation forms in whole fabrics and resulting conditions of sustainability and urbanity. Modality environments are understood in terms of transportation networks and the social and functional factors (like sustainability and urbanity) they produce. Modality environments are seen as lived environments built around movement infrastructure grids that distribute everyday urban functions. Ideally modality environments would be simple clear grids that distribute all or close to all the functions of everyday life so that a walking grid or a bicycle grid that gets adults to work, their children to school and includes shopping and recreation would be walking or bicycle modality environments. They would be expected to have high levels of direct visibility-legibility in the way urban elements present themselves to a mobile community. Modality environments would also include the central places (like high-streets or mobility environments like stations) at which people would transfer to other modality environments. We will use a notion of 'movement culture' to indicate the convergence of land uses and mobile communities mediated in information-rich networks. We are concerned first with how modality environments (for cycling or walking for example) may afford more sustainable lifestyles. We are concerned in addition with the ways they can be designed to include central places as zones of urbanity and vitality and as socially and culturally mixed centres. We start not with a principle of accessibility of\/from nodes in an extensive space but with the idea that particular social and political territories (communities and polities) are already articulations of distinct modality environments. We demonstrate using the case of the Amsterdam metropolitan area.","Author Keywords":"Mobility environments; Modality environments; Urban design; Urban sustainability; Urbanity","Authors":"Read S., Gil J.","DOI":null,"x":9.970000267,"y":6.0100002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":248,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Fostering a More 'Cultured' City through Inclusion: Metrics for Sense of Belonging for Migrants in Chinese Urban Areas","Abstract":"Over the past four decades, infrastructural and economic development in Chinese cities has outpaced its cultural development. As the proportion of people living in cities in China quintupled from 1950 to 2014, from 11% to 54% according to a 2009 report by McKinsey, while at the same time various challenges have paved the way to limit cultural prosperity and quality of life in cities. Cities currently face number of problems: Vehicle-oriented streets are not friendly to pedestrians; public spaces are designed without users in mind [1]; communities are isolated from one another [2]; and finally creative industries are lagging behind other industries according to a 2014 Forbes report. It seems that China's urban development states a condition of \"survivability\" rather than \"livability\". What is understood from the notion of livability within a city today is to be able to sustain quality of life through holistic planning strategies rather than purely economic ones. Such cities create robust natural environments as well as built environments, social equity as well as social stability. And as a result both a more reliable creative prosperity and economic prosperity have been maintained. This paper will seek to establish a 3-pillar approach to social inclusion and will examine each of these through issues related with migrants in China facing today. It seems that there is a great potential in using mobile and web-based technologies to generate rapid and sustainable solutions for migrants. There is also an enormous potential to develop feedback mechanisms for these solutions that can become part of the 'culture' of living in big cities in China. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"hukou; livability; migrants; mobile technology; social inclusion","Authors":"Gorgul E., Luo L., Rivera C.R., Jesseph B.-A.H., Hamel J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.proeng.2017.07.105","x":9.1400003433,"y":8.1800003052},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":249,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Colonial architectures, urban planning and the representation of portuguese imperial history","Abstract":"This article proposes a critical analysis of recent interpretations made to the history of architecture and urban planning in the Portuguese colonial context in the twentieth century, particularly in the former African territories.

This effect is due partly to the fact that the legitimacy of these fields is largely dependent on the national identification in the context of activities that are internationalized.

From its founding, Philadelphia's unfolding futures were consistently dynamic, focusing the energies of colonial expansion, democratic governance, and industrialization in one urban crucible. No other city in America exhibited each trend so dramatically. It was the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876- with the glass and steel dome of its Memorial Hall, its displays of telegraphy and the telephone, its prototype steam automobiles-that first demonstrated to Americans what an industrialized nation might really look like. Ed Bacon was an enthusiast of world's fairs and public exhibitions, writing and speaking of them throughout his career to illustrate and promote trends in urban development, and working in the genre himself to advance a far-reaching planning agenda for Philadelphia in the postwar decades. Philadelphia emerged from World War II burdened by creaking infrastructure and a housing shortage, its Center City business district underperforming against rival cities. Deindustrialization was already noticeable by the mid-1950s, an emerging economic reality that foretold difficulty in achieving the social goals of a new and aggressive generation of reform-minded political leadership.1 Residents were embarking for the suburbs at a steady clip, with the city falling by 1960 from third to fourth in population behind Los Angeles.2 Bacon's 50-year vision projected against this backdrop might have struck the reader as cheerful but unrealistic, even na\u00efve. But what good is a prophecy if it does not reveal a hidden future, a future obstructed? Bacon's future was a city revitalized, beautified, and modernized in time to host the nation's Bicentennial celebration and a simultaneous 1976 Philadelphia World's Fair. Imaginative planning was his method, enabling the political gatekeepers along with the citizens of the city to see with him decades ahead and to grasp the occasion of a fair to accomplish lasting change for the city's built environment and its people. \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009\" builds its case on this one powerful idea: A world's fair could transform it into a model of humane urbanism.3 Considering his vantage point in 1959, it is possible to imagine why Ed Bacon might predict the future of Philadelphia with such mesmerizing flourishes. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC), under his directorship, was in the midst of one of the longest winning streaks any urban planning body had or has ever achieved. With Penn Center, Society Hill, Independence Mall, the neighborhoods of Eastwick and the Far Northeast each underway or finished, Bacon and his team of young planners were totally in their stride in 1959, working to think, dig, and build the city out of its rut. The Market East transportation center, a pedestrian-friendly Chestnut Street, and a tourist-friendly Delaware waterfront were all on Bacon's drawing board, too. These were the varied pieces, described in turn by each of the authors in this volume, of a full urban-renewal portfolio advanced consistently over more than two decades by the PCPC. Postwar federal legislation enabled city officials for the first time to broadly exercise eminent domain powers, moving masses of residents and bulldozing whole sections of the city, planning and building anew.4 Ed Bacon's PCPC was certainly of its time in this respect and forceful in its place, stirring up both wonder and backlash. The old industrial city, the city that had lain fallow through the Depression and World War II, was awakening slowly to the possibility of highrises and integrated transportation hubs, and at the same time rediscovering its walkable character and the vernacular beauties of its historic neighborhoods. Bacon's idea was to liberate William Penn's grid from over a century of industrial-age clutter and to make the city simultaneously auto-, pedestrian-, and investment-friendly. Bacon understood the power of display and salesmanship as keys to making his idea of the next Philadelphia into something tangible. In this spirit, his \"2009\" essay arrived on newsstands in 1959. Could new high-rises and a suburban-style shopping center downtown reverse massive job losses and a suburban exodus? Whether the PCPC's projects were comprehensive enough remained an open question in 1959. In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The \"2009\" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's \"2009\" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the \"master planner\" and by extension New Deal\/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian \"Philadelphia in the Year 2009.\".

Grant and Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil entered Machinery Hall to open the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Since early morning, the day's 186,000 attendees had been streaming through the gates. The president and the emperor stood in front of thirteen acres of motionless machinery, all connected by pulleys, shafts, wheels and belts to the giant Corliss engine in the central transept. Several hundred invited guests, already waiting there, made room for the ceremonial party to climb upon the concrete base of the huge metal monster towering forty feet above their heads almost to the trussed roof of the Hall. Machinery Hall was one of five major buildings put up by exhibition organizers in Fairmount Park; outside groups built dozens more. The Main Building was the largest in the world at the time-over a third of a mile long. Visitors marveled at the items on display: A typewriter, Hires root beer, the Statue of Liberty's torch, the Westinghouse air brake, Fleischmann's yeast, cable from the Brooklyn Bridge, Bell's telephone, and Otis's elevator.2 The Centennial was a resounding success, dramatically displaying Philadelphia's wealth and industrial might. Over nine million people-nearly one-fifth of the country's population-attended before its close in November. It was the first international exposition held in the United States and probably the single most important cultural event of its era. Foreigners flocked to Philadelphia-inaugurating mass tourism to the United States-to see American industrial innovations and dozens of foreign exhibits from Britain, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Japan, China, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and \"two large Arab tents.\" This influx of visitors and national cultures also opened Philadelphia andthe United States to a world of new influences; the Japanese exhibit in particular stirred an Oriental design fashion in the United States.3 Beyond the pomp, the fanfare, the hotel receipts, and the visitors, the Centennial also helped restructure the city's politics. The event both cemented networks of alliances among previously divided elites and marked the ascendance of a Republican hegemony in local political culture that would be virtually unchallenged for the next sixty years. The Republican regime that coalesced in the 1870s combined several elements: party bossism centered in control of several city agencies, an electoral machine that came to trade votes for public construction contracts, business support based in ideological solidarity (support for protectionist legislation), and reliance on rail- And port-related industries as the engine of the city's economy. In Philadelphia's case, the irony is that those Republicans who did the most to make the Centennial happen-large, reformist civic organizations like the Union League that played crucial roles in event planning and in promoting commitment to the Republican Party-did not necessarily enjoy the political fruits of their labors. Over time, the elite's cultural and ideological commitment to Republicanism became a straitjacket, and they lost control of the polity they had helped build. More broadly, I use the example of the Centennial to examine the role that cultural projects play in urban governance. These projects, and the planning efforts that produce them, contribute to the emergence and consolidation of governing regimes out of situations of extreme political discord and fragmentation. They connect processes of elite network formation (social capital) and ideological consolidation. These two processes in turn are the building blocks of hegemony in local governance-cultural and social leadership that shapes people's political commitments and the extent to which they are willing to consider or pursue alternatives to prevailing arrangements. \u00a9 2006 by Temple University Press.

Urban indicators and performance measurement are the answers, aiming to improve local performance on key trends and contribute to solving global problems. Better information, according to the rational model that predominates in urban policy, is the surest path to improve action. The World Urban Forum (WUF) III, meeting in Vancouver in June 2006, considers dimensions, challenges, and practices in the use of urban indicators in the Vancouver region. Patrick Geddes, writing in the early days of the town and regional planning movement, insisted upon the value of what he called a synoptic view, \"a seeing of the city and this as a whole; like Athens from its Acropolis\" (Geddes, 1949, p. 6). Working from a synoptic view did not simply mean gazing down on the city from atop a hill. Geddes strove to help people express \"simultaneity\" of their own being. Understanding that people living in a given region have a multitude of different perspectives, simultaneity of being meant \"one-ness with the social ideals, the scientific developments and the physical conditions of [their] own time and place\" (Geddes, 1949, p. x). He believed a region could be created and planned to aid people in accomplishing all these things. As one of the forefathers of town and regional planning, Geddes himself was a maker of \"great maps and diagrams and charts\" (Geddes, 1949, p. xiii)-but his most lasting contribution to the profession and practice of planning was his notion of the Civic Exhibition. Geddes was less concerned about expert training to make great plans and planners than he was \"concerned that the ordinary citizen should have a vision and a comprehension of the possibilities of his own city\" (Geddes, 1949, p. xi). A periodic Civic Exhibition, during which citizens could gather in a festive atmosphere to peruse plans, gaze at large maps and models, discuss and interpret these publicly, was one part of Geddes's key contribution to this goal. The other part was his drive to create a permanent and public centre for Civic Studies in every town in the form of an \"Outlook Tower\"(Geddes, 1949, p. xi). The Outlook Tower was to be the \"incipient Civic Observatory and Laboratory together\" in which the Science of Cities was advanced to its proper rank amongst academic and life pursuits (Geddes, 1949, p. 96). The institution Geddes sought to create placed \"its effort towards correlation of thought and action, science and practice, sociology and morals, with its watchword and endeavour of \"Civic Survey for Civic Service\"\" (Geddes, 1949, p. 69). Fastforward to late 2004, when the Urban Studies Program at Simon Fraser University's downtown campus initiated the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu), with a vision akin to that of Geddes. In the context of the new millennium, RVu was established as the first local observatory within UN-Habitat's Global Urban Observatory network in a developed country. The Global Urban Observatory was established in 1997 to institutionalize UN-Habitat's pioneering work in the generation and tracking of urban indicators, initiated with the Urban Indicators Programme in 1993. Following the creation of the Habitat Agenda at the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul in 1996, the mission was set for the Global Urban Observatory-to create and maintain a Global Urban Indicators Database that would permit UN member states and their cities to monitor and report on urban trends on a regular and reliable basis. The Millennium Development Goals, established by UN member states in 2000, and the indicators established for tracking these eight goals in 2003, update the mission of the Global Urban Indicators Database (UN-Habitat 2004). The MDGs represent a global compact for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, to be attained by 2015. RVu's work to date is being presented to the international community for the first time at the World Urban Forum III. The work thus far has constituted both expert-based and public participatory components. Experts affiliated with RVu have conducted regional and international research on urban indicator-related work, with some bearing on the Vancouver region and on specific indicators used by a range of projects in the major areas of urban capital: health, economy, environment, governance, culture, and infrastructure. Work in progress toward these research articles was presented at the first RVu public event, Focusing ouR View, in October 2005; and the best finished results are presented in this issue of Cities. Keys to the design of Rvu, and in particular its public participatory process, are presented in the first article in this issue, Urban Indicators and the Integrative Ideals of Cities, by Meg Holden. The paper presents the practice in progress of RVu's stance on urban sustainability as a community-based struggle to learn, indicators as a means for long-term learning, and the role of value-based citizen participation, within a theoretical perspective. Sustainable development, as a framework for long-term planning, has value in the Vancouver region for its \"constructive ambiguity\"(Robinson, 2004, p. 374), its pointers toward greater linkages among environmental, social, and economic priorities, without forcing a premature set of quantitative trade-offs. This integrative, vague, idealistic thrust also leaves sustainable development open to clashes with incremental, specific, and realist demands competing for time on the public agenda. Indicators can help bridge the gap; the articles in this issue begin to explain how. One article presents a bridge from the perspective of environmental economics, illustrating the complexities of measuring natural capital but also the need and precedent for this. The next article presents a way of thinking about indicators of governance for sustainable development from a starting point of allocating equal value to democratic inclusion of each citizen. Moving from the individual to the group, the final two articles ask for greater attention to socially, culturally and demographically-specific cases: new immigrants and Aboriginal people. Nancy Olewiler offers an economist's perspective on the design and utility of an urban indicator project, with a particular focus on natural capital. Her article, Environmental Sustainability for Urban Areas: The Role of Natural Capital Indicators, expands on one of the themes from Holden, the difference between descriptive indicators, which proliferate in policy contexts, and diagnostic indicators, which are rare. Olewiler presents the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and reminds us of the need to consider different indicators at each point in the chain. Her treatment of natural capital indicator issues locally includes useful information on Greater Vancouver's adjacent Fraser Valley Regional District. She looks south to the city of Santa Monica, California for an example of natural capital indicator development and institutionalization. Building on a theme introduced by Holden, Olewiler reminds us that indicators alone are not enough; effective indicators are those presented in a reasoned context with a clear path to actions. Indicators belong at the beginning, not the end, of a good governance process. The next article specifies much more clearly what might be meant by the notion of good governance. In Designing Good Urban Governance Indicators: The Importance of Citizen Participation and its Evaluation in Greater Vancouver, political scientist Kennedy Stewart makes the case for inclusion of governance considerations in any definition of sustainability. The political aspect of sustainability is poorly developed, compared to economic, environmental, and social aspects and this article moves the thinking ahead through treatment of democratic theory, along with work on defining 'good governance' advanced by the United Nations. Stewart draws on evidence of voting patterns in the Vancouver region to raise the spectre of systematic disenfranchisement, that seems to be on the rise. As Canada's only unamalgamated major metropolitan region, led by municipal appointments rather than direct elections, advances in sustainable development policy made by the Greater Vancouver Regional District are at risk if voting trends cannot be reversed. Stewart calls for stepwise moral reasoning, based on the premise of universal equal rights to rectify this wrong. The final two articles examine the limits of belonging to the project of sustainability in the Vancouver region, from the perspective of the region's newest residents and its ancestral residents. Robert Fiedler, Nadine Schuurman and Jennifer Hyndman, in Hidden Homelessness: An Indicator - Based Approach for Examining the Geographies of Recent Immigrants At-Risk of Homelessness in Greater Vancouver, focus on the dimensions of risk of homelessness amongst one particularly vulnerable group, new immigrants. This investigation brings to the fore the interaction of policies, economics, and cultures in explaining the complexities of homelessness and immigration trends in the region. Since about half of the region's population growth in the foreseeable future will come from international immigration, and an increasing proportion of new arrivals face socio-economic difficulties upon arrival, understanding these interactions is key to sustainability in a context of increasing cultural diversity and decreasing affordability of housing. First Nations researcher Nathan Cardinal puts an Aboriginal lens on indicators in his concluding article, The Exclusive City: Identifying, Measuring and Drawing Attention to Aboriginal and Indigenous Experiences in an Urban Context. Along with immigrants, Aboriginal groups constitute fast growing demographic cultural groups in British Columbia.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Holden M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2006.03.002","x":7.8200001717,"y":6.5300002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":261,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2005,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Pleasure-based design approaches to the built environment","Abstract":"As an exercise in discipline cross-fertilisation, this paper applies the emergent practice of pleasure-based approaches in product design to the design of the built environment. This analysis provides insight into humans' emotional responses to the environment that is provided for them. Jordan's four pleasures model, composed of physio-, socio-, psycho- and ideo-pleasures, is used to undertake this analysis. From this analytical process it is evident that physio-, socio- and psycho-pleasures are drawn from generic elements that relate to humans as a kind, and that these commonalities are deeply rooted historical and cultural reference points. Understanding these reference points, and the design principles that emerge from them, will enable those who provide the built environment to engage with the 'super-usability' imperative that these pleasure-based approaches have been drawn from and, in so doing, to develop human-centric solutions that engender positive relationships between people and the environment that is provided for them. However, in the absence of a 'market', one area will remain problematic - that of personalised and individually constructed ideo-pleasure.","Author Keywords":"Design methods & aids; Town & city planning; Urban regeneration","Authors":"Bardill A., Herd K., Karamanoglu M.","DOI":"10.1680\/muen.2005.158.3.183","x":9.1000003815,"y":7.5700001717},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":262,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2005,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Noise, music, and the meaning of modernity","Abstract":"Emily Thompson has shared her views on a revised version of a talk from 'The Soundscape of Modernity: Architectural Acoustics and the Culture of Listening in America' that was presented to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Physique et d\u0301Histoire Naturelle de Gen\u00e9ve on 22nd October, 2004.

The proposed methodology was tested with the design of a Smart Village in Egypt, awarded the second prize in an international competition. Our design approach is based on environmental and social sustainability and works as a genetic algorithm. This process generates the sustainable architecture of the village using the behaviour of biological creatures in artificial systems. The design ultimately ensures that our architecture is nurtured by renewable energies and built with re-cycled materials. The disposition of public spaces and the flexible organization of different functions are conceived in order to stimulate social sustainability, allowing the community to be interdependent as much as an ecosystem. Local cultures, typologies, materials and climate build the DNA of both the village and its buildings. We apply concepts from artificial life, using \"creatures\" that follow simple low-level rules in order to get high-level group behaviour. By combining the principles of artificial life and architecture, we get both high energy-efficiency and optimal placement of built units on a specific site. As in any ecosystem, a fractal, coherent, continuous fluctuation at every scale of the system is vital, and this kinetic flexibility is achieved at four levels: 1) decentralized urban planning; 2) reconfigurable spaces; 3) modular building blocks; 4) kinetic structures that respond to light, climate and people.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Magnoli G.C., Bonanni L.A., Khalaf R.","DOI":null,"x":9.5799999237,"y":6.5799999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":265,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":1991,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The Delhis within Delhi","Abstract":"Concepts and techniques of human settlements cannot be divided from social and economic realities in which they are located.

To improve living conditions in the old areas of the city, while still retaining their character, the \"conservative surgery' approach may be adopted, rather than extensive re-development schemes.

For achieving all this, planning has first to start from outside Delhi, and the National Capital Region plan, the recommendations of the National Commission of Urbanization, and the National Housing Policy all have an impact.

Expectedly the neoliberal political-economic compulsions have opened up scope for capitalistic investment in the city of Kolkata. But, due to lack of decentralized urban facilities and a typical outlook of the people to stay in the \u201ccore\u201d area, construction of high-rise buildings replacing the traditional structures and associated cultures in the old and heritage areas is prominent. Cost of living in the urban core has been increasing rapidly due to the advent of the affluent families, having more purchasing power parity; and thus, the people living for generations as old-settlers have to give up their possession of lands to drift towards the peripheries or sustain by compromising their opulence. As observed, the middle-income groups are badly affected by the consequences of post-liberalized developments. This study has been done on the basis of the authors' participant observations, and review of different published literatures to build a theoretical framework, followed by perception surveys of the diverse residents to understand the problem and validate the proposition. It is argued, that unlike the traditional socially clustered neighbourhoods, especially in old Kolkata, the renewed vertical extension of the gated habitations is promoting more social segregations and exclusions in which interdependence and cohabitation in urban governance may not be truly representative, and therefore, unsustainable in future.

We aim to explore the relationship between urban spatial configuration and functionality. Space syntax methodology is applied to investigate the urban spatial structure concurrently with the analytic hierarchy process method for evaluating experts\u2019 survey responses to attain urban functionality index. Subsequently, the analytical data are compared and categorized to reveal the city districts\u2019 spatial characteristics and their correlation. This research has proven that the analysis findings are consistent with the actual urban conditions, and thus affirms our analytical framework of having a creditable comprehension of the advantage and disadvantage of urban spatial integrations and its functionality. Therefore, our research methodology can be applied as an efficient preliminary evaluation tool for conceiving the merits of city districts. Based on the findings of our research, authorities will be able to discuss the urban development agendas in greater detail with higher efficiency. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","Author Keywords":"Space syntax; urban development; urban function","Authors":"Chiu Y.-H., Chuang I.-T., Tsai C.-Y.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808320924673","x":10.7700004578,"y":7.1399998665},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":274,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Critical Analysis of Urban Livability Measures Based on the Perspective of Placemaking","Abstract":"The livability level of an urban area is a substantial measure of one's sense of connection to their neighborhood. Urban livability is often measured based on various measurable aspects such as stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure as stated in EIU's Global Liveability Ranking. However, these indicators often neglect the nature and processes by which places are made that form people's sense of place much more than the physical availability of urban amenities. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the critical perspective and contribution that placemaking brings to the measures of urban livability. This theoretical study analyzes key concepts and frameworks from secondary data such as reports and journal papers with the inductive content analysis method. Through the lens of placemaking principles, the gaps in many urban livability measures are identified. It is proposed that urban livability measure should incorporate placemaking principles of being community-driven, local assets, bottom-up, and trans-disciplinary to enhance the human-environment quality of urban livability. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Christy F., Raissa G., Sihotang S., Wijaya K.","DOI":"10.1088\/1755-1315\/764\/1\/012016","x":9.1499996185,"y":7.8299999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":275,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Offending sights and urban governance: Expectations of city aesthetics and spatial responses to the unsightly","Abstract":"The problem of incivilities seems to be considerably connected to the visibility of unsightly behaviour. Factors such as urban attractiveness and visibility of the homelessness play important roles in urban social control and have led to the sanitisation and gentrification of city centres. Visual exposure is also relevant to how people perceive and respond to crime. In times of Selfie Culture, where it seems particularly important to some people that the background of their image is beautiful and (Insta)grammable, the right to expose one\u2019s unappetising vulnerability (e.g. homelessness) to the public may clash with others\u2019 beliefs in their entitlement to not see anything ugly or with expectations for urban space to be ordered according to mainstream norms of aesthetic acceptability. The chapter, first, addresses the visibility of incivilities, framing the regulation of offending sights within the gaze-dependent culture. Next, it looks at the contemporary urban responses to the vulnerable groups many deem unsightly, focusing in particular on the spatial-defensive measures aimed at removing certain marginal groups, such as the homeless and youth, from urban space. It then critically examines the wider societal and normative implications of such social control. The chapter concludes with some reflections on defensive architecture within securitised society, and policy considerations. \u00a9 2021 selection and editorial matter, Nina Per\u0161ak and Anna Di Ronco.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Per\u0161ak N.","DOI":"10.4324\/9781003092643-5","x":8.529999733,"y":8.029999733},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":276,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The Impact of Ancient Landscape Changes on the City Arrangement of the Early Shang Dynasty Capital Zhengzhou, Central China","Abstract":"Buried underneath modern Zhengzhou city in Henan Province, China, lies the archeological remains of one of the ancient capital cities of the Shang dynasty (1766 \u2013 1122 BCE). Although it is likely that people planned this Shang capital city according to the demands of the surrounding environment, there is no clear relationship between the current environment, such as the hydrology and topography, and the ancient city\u2019s layout. To better understand the relationship between planning principles used during the Shang dynasty and the nearby environment at Zhengzhou, we measured and sampled stratigraphic exposures at excavation locations throughout Zhengzhou. Through these excavations we obtained both absolute and relative chronological data from each culture layer, enabling us to use geospatial interpolation and analysis methods to reconstruct the ancient landscape. The results show that ancient city\u2019s different activity areas had a close relationship with their environmental context. For example, the Shang dynasty palace was located on high ground and workshops were located down below along the courses of ancient rivers. In conclusion, we argue that research that merges geomorphology and archeology is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the development of urban areas. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Chen, Lu, Yang, Storozum, Yang, Tian, Wang, Wu, Xu, Wang, Yan and Zhai.","Author Keywords":"ancient city arrangement; geomorphic evolution; human-environmental interactions; landscape changes; Zhengzhou Shang City","Authors":"Chen P., Lu P., Yang S., Storozum M., Yang R., Tian Y., Wang H., Wu Q., Xu J., Wang X., Yan L., Zhai H.","DOI":"10.3389\/feart.2021.656193","x":11.25,"y":7.9000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":277,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Eco-mobility Approach for a Sustainable Neighbourhood Road Infrastructure within a Mixed-use Community: The Searchlight on Festac Town, Amuwo Odofin, Lagos","Abstract":"In major cities in Nigeria, the current modes of transportation are generally chaotic and unsustainable. We therefore have to rethink how to adopt the seamless integration of sustainable transportation alternatives. Poor maintenance is one of the factors adduced to be responsible for the current deteriorated state of mobility corridors and the existing road infrastructure. Overpopulation and increasing socio-economic activities of Festac Town exerts undue pressure on the infrastructure, thereby accelerating deterioration. The study is underpinned by Eco-mobility principles. This study is aimed at assessing the eco-mobility approach for a sustainable neighbourhood road infrastructure within a mixed-use community. Developing a sustainable mobility strategies that brings the neighborhood streets back to the people is an objective which this study pursue. A multi-staged sampling technique was adopted for the study. On-site qualitative approach was majorly employed through the interviews conducted assessing the major mobility corridors and streets from 1st to 7th avenues. A sample frame of 15 major roads with outdoor open spaces along the selected roads all within the selected avenues and major street roads. The instruments for data collection were oral interviews and personal\/physical observations. The activity profiles, locational data and geospatial coordinates of each avenue were imported into ArcGIS (Version 10.5, ESRI) for various land-use analysis. The sustainable eco-mobility strategies will reduce transportation impacts, create civilized streets that meets environmental design standards of commuter's safety and comfort that are compatible with the unique urban structure and culture of metropolitan Lagos. This study evaluated the issues relating to sustainable eco-mobility, the connection between climate change and transportation systems, the impact of urban mobility on public health and wellbeing.

Learning from Lyon Metropolis","Abstract":"In 1995, the English planner Charles Landry and Franco Bianchini published \u201cThe Creative City\u201d, focusing on three intertwined topics: the cultural, social, and economic impact that arises from creativity in cities; the need to promote integrated urban planning levering on knowledge from other disciplines; and the active inclusion in urban planning processes of ordinary, often marginalized people. A few years later, Landry issues \u201cThe Creative City. A Toolkit for Urban Innovation\u201d, a book in which he challenges and further develops his ideas by proposing them as a \u201ctoolbox for urban renaissance.\u201d At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the American economist Richard Florida delivers what is considered a milestone on the subject of the creative city: \u201cThe Rise of the Creative Class\u201d, in which he emphasizes the characteristics of people performing creative activities in cities, as well as the conditions that cities must offer in order for the \u201ccreative class\u201d to be attracted and settle in them. The Smart Creative City is a more recent concept. It grew out of economic science, especially the so-called Experience Economy. Regarding specifically the economic development of cities, creativity, art, and culture represent strategic assets in the urban regeneration process, and the socioeconomic feature of smart creative cities can be considered the most evident and critical one. This study thus springs from the recognition of the relevance of smart creative cities, and of an integrated and visionary planning approach to urban regeneration\u2014itself creative. This analysis has been conducted focusing on selected experiences developed by Lyon metropolis, aiming at understanding whether and how the municipality is levering on creativity, art and culture within its urban regeneration programmes. This objective is addressed through a mixed-qualitative methodology that investigates the political discourse and adopts a descriptive case study approach to analyse policy processes, drivers, and obstacles that are fostering or limiting that vision in the local context of Lyon. The research responds to the questions posed, showing both the transformative capacity and the trade-offs of explicitly integrating cultural and artistic projects and events, as urban \u201cinnovative\u201d regeneration devices, within the \u201ccommon\u201d planning and design practice of the municipality of Lyon. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Creative clusters; Experience economy; Lyon confluence; Lyon Gerland; Urban art","Authors":"Andreucci M.B.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-57332-4_29","x":7.7399997711,"y":9.0799999237},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":282,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Spectacles of the Temporal City: An Analysis of the Effects of Festivals on Identity in an Urban Context","Abstract":"Cities around the world are becoming complex systems wherein every city possess unique identity manifested through its people and activities that occur in its urban spaces. The sense of urban space is an ever-changing concept and to understand the fabric of urban spaces, knowledge of the concept of space and its interrelations is required. Reading a city in a time where change is the norm, with urban spaces gaining new meanings and functions with changes in cultural practices conveys the hybrid urgencies of metropolitan India. An analysis is thus, particularly relevant in India, as in the post-industrial scenario, cities in India have become some of the largest urban conglomerates with a dualist identity of static and kinetic pervading their urban landscape. The static city is the conventional physical entity of a city whereas, the kinetic city is perceived as a city in motion, temporary in nature and the emerging symbolic image of urban India. Understanding these multitudes of identities in the backdrop of traditional events and festivals, as temporal transformations of urban spaces will thus highlight the dominant visual culture of Indian cities. This Temporal City enables a better understanding of the blurred lines of contemporary urbanism and the changing roles of social space in the urban fabric. This study focused on the ancient festival of Ambubachi in the historic Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, India, through visual ethnography, participant observations, open-ended interviews, photography and document analysis. The central concern of this paper is to develop a critical stance on understanding the identities of cities through the study of urban spectacles such as festivals in a bid to illustrate the fluid and dynamic aspect of one\u2019s identity that is being constantly redefined and reconstructed with time, space, activities and context. Through the analysis of this ancient festival of Ambubachi in the light of \u2018identity\u2019 and \u2018place attachment\u2019 of the festivalgoers, the emerging notions of identity will be explored. The fieldwork sought to analyse two major aspects: The first was the generic, spatial characteristics of festival spaces and the second was the temporal, fleeting events that occur in their physical settings following the parameters of event-space relationship by Frenchman in a bid to understand how such eventful urban spaces manifest in the negotiation of one\u2019s identity. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Festivals; Identity; Place attachment; Place identity; Social space","Authors":"Das A., Das A.K.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-981-16-0041-8_61","x":7.6100001335,"y":4.9400000572},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":283,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Governing with conversation culture\u2013conditioning organizational interaction in a digital social movement","Abstract":"Digital platforms support forms of collective action with varying degrees of organizationality\u2013that is, with organization-like attributes such as identity, actorhood, and decision-making.

By analyzing private chat logs of the group administrators, we explore the group\u2019s organizationality and the ways in which organizational and interactional communication become intertwined to produce and curate digital political discussions. Our findings illustrate how technological affordances built for moderation also support the strategic organization of discussions to orchestrate political talk.

Modern tendencies, author\u2019s own experience","Abstract":"The subjects of this dissertation are buildings intended for music and their role in urban space. Houses for music \u2013 that is how we can briefly name buildings whose basic function is listening to music in the form of a concert - Philharmonic buildings. Also in the form of a show or performance fused with music. The third function of such buildings is to ensure the possibility for people to meet, adding certain nobility to the event in question, and therefore, added nobility to the venue itself. This last function is gaining significance. It is accompanied by the phenomenon of identifying the event as the function itself and simultaneously identifying the site. The growing value of such places stems from the oldest concept of urban planning, in search for that \u2018modernity\u2018of the 20th century, an idea which has been forgotten and is now going through its revival. As Jan Gehl, an urban expert and humanist, reminds us, referring to the\u2019city for people\u2019. He reminds us that the number and the quality of the places are of utmost importance \u2013 places which create the occasion to participate in the urban membrane. The need for meeting builds the identity of a place, connecting cultural ideas with concepts which create culture and put architecture and music in the centre. The sound of the music itself becomes an element of the identity, the sound \u2013 however invisible, is very important for the place \u2013 on equal rights with the architecture of the designed buildings. The sound facilitated in the designs of these buildings creates the final quality of the architecture of the opera house or the Philharmonic. The dualism of the architectural and musical thought in the creation of the concept played a decisive role in creating the functionality of the venue, creating the true value of the place. It becomes a highly significant element of the quality of urban space. This short musing shows us that architecture and music are linked inter-disciplinarily as an important or perhaps even basic material for these buildings. The increasing significance of the relation between the buildings intended for music with the social strata of the city is very much visible in contemporary architectural concepts.The subject of this dissertation is the architectural concept and the context of buildings intended for music in urban space.

And while the city is considered one of the most important means of accomplishing economic and social development goals, this paper argues that urban planning affects the relationship between the city and the city's people as well as the development of its commercial growth. This study aims to research and compare the advantages and the disadvantages between the shops opened directly to a street and the shops opened to a plaza (the pedestrian mall) in Irbid city downtown. The study has focused on the identification of architectural and urban patterns and the artistic aspects of urban design. Conversely, this research aims to identity the needs of the users by introducing the hypothesis that the behavioral patterns in any designed space relies on the designers personal perceptions and understanding of the behavioral and usage patterns of the individuals within it, the understanding of which positively reflects on both the spatial qualities and the individual's perception of it. The questions of this research are as follows: (1) What is the role of the design of the commercial shops in creating a sense of pleasure and safety in the downtown of Irbid city? (2) How do shops play out their role in the growth and expansion of commercial development? Through visual survey and the analytical studies of the GIS data, the research determines an overall preference of one of the market-space designs. The results show that shops which are opened to a plaza are vital in giving a sense of security and integrity to the concept of the downtown commercial area, it also provides organization among the different parts of the commercial area and plays two important roles: (1) they interconnect the different parts of the city's physical structure; and (2) the vital role of the city's economic and social life. In conclusion, this paper offers recommendations for the redesign and development of the building's regulations in the downtown to achieve the proper relationship between urban planning and urban development, deal with the modern city development and reflect the relationship with its own culture. \u00a9 2020 WITPress.

A common good produced and distributed contrary to the logic of capital in a modern city, at a time it was desperately lacking its resources. The cooperative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition was to show people how to live and to turn (passive) residents into (active) citizens. Soon, the cooperative\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founders have transpired to be\u00e2\u20ac\u201das we would now say\u00e2\u20ac\u201dactivists, or critical spatial practitioners (Markus Miessen), and the development became a laboratory for modernist urban planning practices. What began as an estate for working-class residents, thanks to the involvement of intellectuals keen on the concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsociology in action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, saw the introduction of numerous experimental forms of urban communal living. An analysis of this historical case relates to questions often posed today by both the urban grass-roots movements and researchers such as David Harvey and Andy Merrifield: Who owns the city? Who does the city belong to? Who should manage the city and how? The performative perspective allows me to see \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcarchitecture in action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and dwelling as a process, rather than a form. The resident-turned citizen can be seen as engaged in subversive and freedom-oriented undertakings (social, political, economic and educational). In turn, the critical perspective (inseparable from the performative one) revealed the extraordinary power of rebellion and the desire for change resulting from the combination of thought and action, thanks to culture understood as praxis. I assume that the WHC residents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strategies, described in this book, may prove valuable particularly today, when modern cities are implementing a model of governance based on urban entrepreneurship, while local governments are eager to dismantle the municipal social welfare system, privatise public goods and collective consumption and cooperate with private investors more often than with residents. \u00a9 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Criticism of modernity; Performative perspective; Preposterous history; Urban studies; Utopian studies","Authors":"Matysek-Imieli\u00c5\u201eska M.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-23077-7_1","x":9.279999733,"y":4.7899999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":297,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Modern approaches to preservation and development of historical objects of culture","Abstract":"Architecture is always a memory tool.

Imagining and designing urban environments where all people thrive is an extraordinary task, and in this compelling narrative, Cushing and Miller remind us that theory is a powerful starting point. Drawing on international research, illustrated case studies, personal experiences, as well as fascinating examples from history and pop culture, this practical book provides the reader with inspiration, guidance and tools. The first section outlines six critical theories for contemporary urban design - affordance, prospect-refuge, personal space, sense of place\/genius loci, place attachment, and biophilic design. The second section, using their innovative 'theory-storming' process, demonstrates how designers can create great places that are inclusive, sustainable, and salutogenic.

This settlement, Castro of Senhora do Bom Sucesso is a place where the surrounding landscape stands out with several mountains around it, in an environment where the flora and fauna, characteristics of this region, stand out. The whole history of the place, refers to a certain period of the past, valuing it and able to make the experience that the Nature Tourism can provide even better. Being one of the highest places in the central region of Portugal, it is for many people, a special place of enjoyment and relaxation. In this place, hundreds of years ago, there were between 80 and 100 houses of ancient people from the Celtic culture. Later, due to the abandonment by Men, these houses became disused, falling into a rapid decay process with the collapse of walls and roofs, making the roads impassable and the place covered with vegetation. Thus, in this work, in methodological terms, based on literature review, the collection of cartographic elements of the place, and in the field and cabinet studies, it was possible to develop an investigation on the Military Heritage of the region, in order to analyze in detail, the relation of the nature of the place with the architecture. This work resulted in a proposal for the site of the former Castro do Bom Sucesso, with the main objective of creating an Ecotourism Park, around the Celtic culture and autochthonous nature, organized in the following main equipment: I) Reception of the Ecotourism Park; (ii) \"Celtic Bungalows\" iii) Celtic Interpretation Center; iv) biological pool and v) Camping. The paper presents the main elements developed, from the design to the form and location of the equipment that, to be built, is believed to improve the regional economy through a scientific, didactic, cultural and sustainable tourism. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Gomes Rodrigues M.V., Ferreira Gomes L.M., Cabral De Carvalho A.B., Miranda Beato C.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/4\/042045","x":8.8999996185,"y":5.0999999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":301,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Studies on reconstruction of the Holy Cross wooden church in Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski","Abstract":"Wooden churches used to commonly appear in Silesia through the past centuries. Their location was the result of local people's needs and the accessibility of materials necessary to construct them. The form and the nature of those churches were the fruit of intermingling influences of various national cultures of the inhabitants of those areas, craftsmanship experience of various structure builders and depended on the extent of wealth of the cities, towns and villages they were erected in. Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski was among the places with wooden sacred objects, in the 19th century, it was a small town with population consisting mainly of Poles, Germans and Jews.The Holy Cross wooden church was a hospital object. The church itself was situated on top of a low hill with a brook flowing in its direct vicinity. In the periods of heavy rainfalls, the rapid stream used to wash out the hill, thus, affecting the church foundations, directly contributing to deterioration of the structure's technical condition. The critically bad condition of the church structure was the main reason for the decision to pull it down after 1826. Throughout the recent years, the growth of the local patriotism induced the interest in the town's history and its historical panorama. Relatively few pieces of information on the church and no drawings thereof have been preserved. The archeological and architectural research revealed a lot of interesting facts related to the church and concerning its structure and its supposed non-typical form. A realistic method to satisfy the curiosity how the church looked like in the period of its splendor was the construction of its model based on the research and studies carried out, the very construction of the miniature model in progress being a test site verifying some suppositions about the church's appearance. The model built was added to the exhibits of the Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski Museum, becoming a contribution to the discussion on methods of the dissemination of information on the historical view of the town and including the research results in the papers concerning the future form and the panorama of modern Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Pocisk-Dobrowolski J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/4\/042020","x":9.6000003815,"y":4.8499999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":302,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"From stone masonry to emigrant's mansions. Changes in vernacular architecture in central Portugal","Abstract":"The research made for this purpose was realized to study the connection between the way of life, the climate, the geology and the vernacular architecture in the parish of Cernache do Bonjardim, municipality of Sert\u00e3, central region of Portugal, where various styles of rural houses can be found. The traditional rural home of this territory is constituted by stone walls, mostly made of shales or granite and has two floors: a lower floor with a place for animals or food storage, and an upper floor with the kitchen\/living-room and bedrooms. Usually, both floors are joined by outside stairs. Each available space, for instance under these stairs, is used to keep animals like swine or hens, goats or rabbits, and to store food. Usually there is a piece of ground around the house used for the plantation of vegetables and fruit trees. This kind of home is adapted to the people's way of living and the climate, using local materials like stone or wood. In the 19th century there was an emigration wave to Brazil. When the people returned they wanted to show their acquired richness and (sometimes) culture to the neighbours in the village and constructed large houses of mansion-type, which didn't show the strong adaption to the environment anymore, but had other functionalities and a better comfort. As the transportation means improved, the building material was no more limited to the local offer. The emigration from the sixties of the 20th century until today brought new kinds of buildings. Their style was influenced from the country of emigration. There is no more relation to the local style of building. For the construction, modern materials like concrete, tile walls and roof tiles are used. The major conclusions of the research are that the vernacular architecture of the studied region has changed from houses adapted to the climate and the rural way of life, to larger and no more \"typical\" buildings. The main reasons for this change are the return of emigrants from abroad and its influence, the availability of new materials, the better education and income of the people, the wish to life more comfortably, and the change of the people's way of life from farming to employment. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Marcal Goncalves M., Teresa Perez Cano M., Rosendahl S.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/2\/022064","x":8.8800001144,"y":5.1599998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":303,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Identity construction of the European medium sized city through the monasticism repercussions in \u00c9cija","Abstract":"The monasticism appeared during the dawn of Christianity has made a major contribution to Europe's culture and identity. The spread of Christian faith throughout the continent was achieved not only through a new morality and religion but also through art and convent architecture. The Middle Ages were the peak of this monastic production. Orders such as Cistercians or Dominicans would appear mainly in France and Italy spreading their rules and ways of life to the whole continent. It is a phenomenon that transcends borders, kingdoms and geographical elements, bringing together many people under the same identity. The flag of the Latin cross waved in the European Middle Ages. However, the reality in southern Iberian Peninsula was different. Al-Andalus stood as a bastion of Islam in Europe long before the appearance of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Castile began to occupy territories held by the Muslim Kingdom of Granada. The need to Christianise the new conquered lands would call a multitude of monastic orders settled in Europe to focus their attention on the new Kingdom of Seville. The main cities such as Seville, Cordoba, etc. would be the most coveted for the new foundations. Nevertheless, \u00c9cija is located in the Guadalquivir river valley in a difficult position on the border with the Kingdom of Granada. In the 14th Century, \u00c9cija had close to 10, 000 inhabitants, which, at the time, was a large number. A city which was an attraction point for Christian Communities, which according to their origin, 31% came from Italy, 22% from France, 37% from Spain and 10% from Jerusalem. The study of \u00c9cija shows the crossing of continental relationships through monasticism. How could the influence of Christianity manage to cover an entire continent to the most remote place? We could find the keys to understand the urban construction of western monasticism through the main average conventual cities in Andalusia. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Ostos-Prieto F.-J., Costa Rosado A., Aladro-Prieto J.-M., Perez-Cano T.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/2\/022053","x":8.8699998856,"y":4.8899998665},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":304,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Visitors Voice in Historic Sites Interpretation Centres in Bahrain","Abstract":"Throughout the past decade, a number of site interpretation centres, such as site museums, visitor centres, site exhibits, have grown in Bahrain, a country that is seeking international recognition through culture. This specific typology of museums intends to explain the nearby historical site through the use of multiple interpretation strategies. Understanding the visitors' expectations is an important component in the success of cultural institutions. Exploring the components of a visitor experience and expectations within site interpretation centres has, so far, received limited attention. Hence, this research intends to analyse the visitors' experience and expectations in a specific site interpretation centre in Bahrain: Qalat al Bahrain Site Museum. The visitor's experience and expectations were assessed through two streams of feedbacks. First, an analysis of the comments recorded on the visitors' book. These comments addressed the visitors' reflections, expectations, experiences, and the type of activities undertaken within the premises. Second, the online TripAdvisor from 169 valid returns, 200 TripAdvisor comments and an overview of the visitors' written comments, different types of emotional and spiritual experience expectations were extracted for further analysis... In parallel, this research analysed visitors' behaviour through observation inclusive of different timings during the day and during the year to understand the impact of climatic condition on the visitors' experience and expectations for validation purposes. Finally, some related scholarship discussions and suggestions were proposed based on visitors voice and reflection underlining the reasons why people choose to visit site interpretation centres with reference to personal and social demands. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Al-Saffar M., Anissa Tabet Aoul K.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/5\/052006","x":8.5399999619,"y":8.8199996948},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":305,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"South Chile - Extreme Architecture","Abstract":"Typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions on the one hand, and the lack of roads due to the inaccessibility of mountain areas and the extended coastline, combined with the harsh climate of both hot and polar, on the other, make designing and building in Chile an extreme task. It is and always was also hard to design and build in Chile due to the isolation of this country from the rest of the South American continent thanks to the difficulty to overcome the barrier formed by the Andes. Can these unique conditions be used to create a unique architecture that brings new qualities to global heritage? Perhaps all these \"threats\" are also a significant potential for creation, using beautiful landscapes and pure nature. In the beginning, there was the Word. Architectural culture requires faith and extreme sacrifice. For this reason, the presentation begins with a project to which its architects devoted their lives and decided to become men of the cloth. Buildings devoted to religious worship often exceed the utilitarian dimension of architecture, becoming the determinants of directions that architecture will follow. An example of this heroic expression of architecture is the construction of the Benedictine Church in Les Condes, a suburb of Santiago, in 1962-1964. Can Theatre be a cure allowing people to overcome trauma? The programme of reconstruction of the city of Concepci\u00f3n in Chile after the destruction wrought in 2010 by the tsunami, included not only the restoration of previously existing housing and infrastructural functions, but also the introduction of new cultural function. In 2011, an architectural competition for the design of the Regional Theatre was announced, which was won by three Chilean architects Smiljan Radi\u0107, Eduardo Castillo and Gabriela Medrano. The building was put into use in 2018 and is not only a monument of the past, but also a sign of a new beginning (Figure 1). One of Chile's greatest natural resources is its diverse landscape. Difficult accessibility of many areas, low population density and unfavourable climate are the main factors that have caused large areas of land to remain in their natural state. Along with the development of society and the popularisation of tourism, a need arose to build the right background for exploring these natural values. The history tourism in extreme conditions is not long. In Poland, for example, it dates to 1850, when the first winter expedition to the Valley of Five Ponds in the Tatra Mountains took place. In Chile, the first tourist expedition to Patagonia took place in 1879 and was described in the book by its organiser and participant, Lady Lorance Dixie (Dixie, 1880). These extremely hard natural conditions have created a unique opportunity to create modern architecture in interaction with the natural landscape. We will examine this problem on the example of 5 hotels and 5 ways of interacting with the landscape and study these architectural ideas. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Butelski K.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/2\/022047","x":8.9300003052,"y":5.8800001144},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":306,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Experiential Learning for Seismic Protection Using Living Lab Approach in Romania","Abstract":"The purpose of the research: The paper is going to present the role of seismic areas as living labs\/natural laboratories for studying the behavior of buildings and of people and establishing a relationship between a research, a training-education and a knowledge dissemination. The results materialized by experiential actions to reduce negative impacts of disasters are highlighted. Methodology: Engineering learning from earthquakes, based on a long-term seismic culture, became a continuous activity based on field observation, since more than a century. On the other hand, creating earthquake disaster prevention awareness and disaster preparedness can be achieved nowadays by education and active learning addressed to all levels of population, from elder generations to the younger ones, and from usual people to the representatives of authorities. The link between these two approaches is becoming more and more necessary in the context of high local seismicity: investigating the behavior of people, while using emerging technologies (computer-generated imagery, immersive virtual reality etc.), to obtain an active individual attitude. The general concept of awareness and preparedness trends evolved. To deal with earthquake-related situations, people are taught to take measures to prevent severe earthquakes effects, but we must take a step forward to get closer to the system that includes: research knowledge, innovation, GIS and specialized software, and more importantly, the access to all of these, through public and private involvement. Conclusions: The Vrancea seismic zone of Romania, as a natural laboratory, involves us with knowledge and individual perception and attitudes and we have time for improved engineering codes, exploring and experiencing some new learning modalities, refining new policies and regulations from this field, new scenarios for implementation of disaster measures. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Dobre D., Sorin Dragomir C., Georgescu E.-S.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/2\/022020","x":9.4399995804,"y":6.1599998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":307,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Une ville des jardins: The consiglio d\u2019ornato and the urban transformation of nice (1832-1860)","Abstract":"This article examines the urban transformation of Nice in the early nineteenth century.

It is seen as the core of a city which functions as a focal point in the public space network, providing a space for the community social interaction. However, many of the new public spaces in the 20th century has been a void setting and unsuccessful to create a public open space for social interaction that is vibrant with life. The notion of square was adopted from the European culture as far back as 17th century and has been adapted in Malaysia. This could be seen in today\u2019s square design in Malaysia. However, the behaviour pattern indicate otherwise as the present day square design does not respond to the local climatic context with lack of shaded areas. Hence, people tend to avoid social interactions in public square during daytime due to undesirable weather condition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the positive aspects of traditional square that has been successful in supporting the community social interaction, and establishing a general guide for the design of new square as a public open space in Malaysian context. Amongst the consideration to be derived from this adaption is the Malaysian local context in terms of historical significance, culture and climate. Dutch Square in Melaka Historical Town was chosen as the case study, because it represents a model of traditional square as a public open space that still functions in term of attracting people to this day. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches were used in this study. Behavioral mapping allowed for statistical analysis where as observation and still photography as the descriptive to support the outcome of behavioural mapping. Therefore, the data collected are more reliable and able to be cross checked for further examinations of the findings.

The Convention imposes an obligation on the state to ensure that all persons with disabilities have access to physical environment, means of transport, information and communication, including ICT technologies and systems, as well as other tools and services, commonly accessible or assured, both in the cities and in the countryside, on equal basis. Having this in mind, together with the voice of the persons with blindness or having greatly reduced vision, and taking into account the chaos in the markings in public space that were supposed to improve the way the persons with disabilities move, it is necessary to design and implement the adequate standards on the roads and in the streets. It is estimated that about 5% of the total country population in Poland are persons with disabilities. About 1.8 million of them are people affected by blindness, partial blindness or low vision, who at the same time are active participants of the public space and of the road traffic. However, the lack of any systemic solutions regulated by law that improve safety in the road traffic is a serious problem in enabling access to culture, as well as free and safe movement for persons with poor vision.

Towns of Malopolska Voivodeship in number of 61 are characterized by a significant diversity in size and level of development. Small towns which make up over 77% of the total number differ considerably both in the aspect of the ongoing demographic processes and the results of the contemporary economic transformation. The vast majority of cities in Malopolska in number 43 towns are quite small with population below 20 thousand inhabitants. The smallest towns barely exceed 2 thousand people. There are approximately 30 thousand various business operating at present in all small towns of Malopolska Voivodeship. Their number varies from area to area depending on economic and social factors as well as on the geographic location transport accessibility. Social and spatial growth of small towns is affected by the globalization and metropolisation processes. The process of current transportation of the country economic system is reflected in spatial changes of the towns in the Malopolska. Prospect of development of small towns are differently due to changes of their economic functions and influenced by the geographic position, communal and technical infrastructure. Another parallel subject of consideration are revitalization activities undertaken within local revitalization programmes which are a basis for obtaining EU assistance funds allotted for this purpose. Author presents the planned spatial activities closed in revitalization programmes for the purpose of softening the conflicts in spatial sphere, improvement of living conditions and increasing of attractiveness for investors and tourists. Centres of small towns have symbolic significance for the sense of identity of their inhabitants. These are the areas where there are religions and historic buildings as well as public spaces promoting integration of residents such as market squares. In present social-economic conditions landmark squares in small towns due to preserved values despite of various degradations should be and can be remarkable and significant element of town attractiveness. Small towns have culture related assets and a special identity which may attract numerous tourists and investors on the condition that they have formulated a precise strategy of development high-lighting the elements most powerfully expressing their identity. The ways of development of small towns in their social-economic growth is related to diverse service functions and individual functional and aesthetic programme consistent with the towns specific character and its role in the region. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Pawlak A.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/11\/112061","x":9.529999733,"y":4.8600001335},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":314,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Architecture of the National Bank of Czechoslovakia in the Territory of Present-day Slovakia (1918 - 1938)","Abstract":"The end of the Great war brought about many changes in the European political, social and economic climate. Monarchies were replaced with more democratic systems, countries lost their territories, and new sates based on national principle were established. In 1918, after a period of ethnic oppression and magyarization in the Hungarian part of the Habsburg Empire following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the Bohemian and Slovak people declared their independence and founded a new national state - the Czechoslovakia. The period short after its foundation was one full of enthusiasm and joy stemming from the newfound freedom and opportunity for cultivation of national culture, identity and politics in democratic environment on the one hand, and challenges brought by the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian economy and political system on the other. As a result of establishing the new state, the need arose to define its nation by architecture and the issue of National Style reemerged. After the brief period of Rondocubism preference, for some time, the official buildings retained certain expressive character and massive features. Even after giving way to Modernism, the sense of traditionalism was evident. In the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, bank buildings, as buildings of institutions that once supported national-emancipatory aspirations of Slovak people, bank architecture often used well-established schemes and preferred more traditional designs to convey desired messages. The institution in charge of monetary separation and management of the new currency was the Banking Office of the Ministry of Finance and subsequently the National Bank of Czechoslovakia (since 1926). After the collapse of Austro-Hungarian Empire, all the buildings of branch offices of the former central bank - the Austro-Hungarian Bank - were took over by the Czechoslovak government. These were often extended, as were the cases of branch office buildings in Bratislava, Ko\u0161ice and \u017dilina. When they no longer fitted the formal or capacity criteria, three new branch office buildings were built on the territory of present-day Slovakia: a neo-renaissance building in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica (Ladislav Sk\u0159iv\u00e1nek, 1930 - 1932) and two buildings in the style of regional modernism with notes of traditionalism and classical features in Ru\u017eomberok (Vladim\u00edr Fischer, 1930 - 1932) and Bratislava (Emil Bellu\u0161, 1936-1938). The article examines stylistic, ideological, formal, and layout requirements for an architectural concept of a central bank institution demonstrated on the examples of branch office buildings built during existence of the First Czechoslovak Republic in the territory of the present-day Slovakia. As a part of a systematic research focused on Slovak bank buildings, the chosen buildings will be analysed, compared with relevant examples, and interpreted in the context of political, social, and economical situation, and style and typological particularities. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Ondrusova K.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/8\/082043","x":9.6400003433,"y":4.7800002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":316,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Floating Village Cua Van: Promoting Climate-Adaptive Ecotourism with Principles of Living Spaces","Abstract":"Ha Long Bay\u2014the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site on Vietnam\u2019s northeastern seacoast\u2014is often considered one of the world\u2019s most beautiful bays. This bay is also famous for many floating fishing villages where the people live together on the sea as a community. However, due to rapid population growth in the floating villages, the present situation shows lacks in urban planning, waste management and development of infrastructure. Ha Long Bay had suffered the pressure of environmental pollution and resource degradation. Since 2014, in order to protect the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the local authority has planned a project to demolish the floating villages and move these communities to the mainland. In fact, the demolition project has caused the loss of cultural heritage and a tourist attraction in Ha Long Bay. The goal of this study is to propose a sustainable concept of living space organization for Cua Van, the largest floating village in Ha Long Bay, in order to preserve, revive, and promote floating communities as a unique heritage culture and tourist attraction. Therefore, a detailed analysis of environment and socio-cultural, economic, architectural characteristics of Cua Van is provided in this study. The analysis does not only accumulate precious traditional values that need to be preserved and developed in the proposed concept but also illustrate its weakness that need to be addressed to optimally design the future sustainable floating village. Based on these studies, as well as on general principles of a sustainable floating community and promoting ecotourism, the study proposes a living space concept for Cua Van, including solutions to both a sustainable floating community adapting to climate change and ecotourism development. The proposed concept would ensure stable and permanent living on the water for water dwellers and reduce human-induced impacts on the environment as well as an increasing livelihood income by tourism development. \u00a9 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Climate change; Ecotourism; Floating villages; Sustainable floating community","Authors":"Trang N.T.T., Vukorep I., Stopp H.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-10804-5_2","x":9.3599996567,"y":8.9399995804},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":317,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Transforming traditions: Place, ideology, development, and planning in bali","Abstract":"This chapter addresses a globally celebrated culture - Bali, the Island of the Gods.

And the research on urban sprawl or urban growth has mostly focused on the urbanization of buildings, such as bungalows changing into skyscrapers. Moreover, there are a lot of scholars study urban sprawl from the aspect of evolution and development of industry in the urban fringe. But more and more sociologists present an idea that urbanism is not only the evolution of land use or changes of other objective things, is but also a kind of life style, a whole set of social and culture characteristics, which is totally different from that of rural area. This review summarizes studies of urban sprawl from many sides, and then conducts a diverse understanding of urban sprawl and urbanization, which points out that social is made of people and urbanization should add the concept of people's urbanism, such as the social mixing, social integration.

These interaction flows are considered smart for making strategic use of infrastructure, services, information and communication with urban planning and management to meet social and economic needs of society. According to Berrone (2016), the 10 dimensions indicate the level of intelligence of a city: governance, public administration, urban planning, technology, the environment, international connections, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. Thus, this study is proposed here address two of these topics: governance and economy.

The first is to renounce any specialized approach that is based on an acritical confidence in the power of science and technology to solve the complex problems of today\u2019s world, particularly those that concern the environment and the poor. The second is to adopt an approach based on a \u201cculture of care\u201d for nature and for the most vulnerable people, and third approach is to include people (especially those who are weakest) in transparent decision-making processes that affect the quality of their lives.

The future of the majority of World's population is connected currently with the urban life with the assumption that qualitative characteristics of life in the 21st century define the quality of civilisation itself. Contrary to many scientists' predictions of the decline of the city and urbanity, new reviving urban projects, social local activities and everyday urbanism appear which are connected with redefinition of the city as a community. The rebirth of cities, currently referred to as \"urban renaissance\", \"urban resurgence\" or \"urban revival\", can be also defined in terms of new urbanity regarded as an insightful and creative attitude towards the city and its culture. The elementary order of things was determined in the last decades not by the space but by the time and its acceleration and simultaneously the role of architecture alters. The course of thinking about the city is changing from a single space-time city towards a personalised city, based on individual identities and corresponding places in the physical and virtual space. That can mean a new role of the city in the creation of urbanity. In the era of advanced communication technologies, a question arises about the ontological status of the city when the emphasis is placed on independence and individuality in interactions between people. Social life becomes detached from traditional spatial patterns and practices. We are interested in the urbanity understood in the wider context of cultural urban studies which are focused on new ways of organising the communication space and social relations.

A city is marked by diversity, modernity, high-rise buildings, modern infrastructure and consumerism. Popular culture is one of the many resources for understanding the cityscape. The city is not just about physical and material spaces but also includes the lived experiences, interactions, contestations, exclusions and power relationships. Many urban geographers opine that cinema reflects and represents these issues as well as the discourses about the city. There is little or no research on the Cinematic City of Hyderabad. This article analyses the movie Siva, which captured the essence of the city of Hyderabad. The discussion maps out its urban spaces by using semiotic and discourse analysis, and addresses the different themes that the discourse reveals.

The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city.

They are planning central city areas under the principles of DRR as well as BBB. There are too many laws pertaining to disaster prevention and reconstruction to refer to in full here. Therefore, this chapter focuses only on some of the new enactments after the GEJE. But attention has to be paid to their approaches to reconstruction when it comes to the question of whether they sufficiently concord with DRR and BBB (Ikuta 2013; Kaneko 2014). The Basic Act on Reconstruction in Response to the GEJE 2011 (hereinafter the Basic Act 2011) prescribes that, considering the unprecedented national crisis caused by the GEJE, the act has the purpose of promoting the smooth and prompt reconstruction and revitalization of a vibrant Japan, securing financial resources, identifying afflicted areas as Special Zones for Reconstruction with institutional and tax measures and establishing a Reconstruction Agency to undertake tasks regarding integrated national measures (Art. 1). The Basic Act 2011 then prescribes its basic philosophy, adopting the idea of the building back better concept, promoting dramatic measures for revitalization that are not limited to physical recovery of afflicted facilities, but also reconstruction measures to assist individuals to overcome the disaster and lead prosperous lives while honoring local culture and enhancing people\u2019s ties with the community (Art. 2). The Act for Special Zones for Reconstruction 2011 was enacted as separate legislation from the Basic Act 2011 to implement the reconstruction measures. Under this legislation, afflicted local governments designated as special areas can acquire significantly larger budget funds from the national government for recovery and can deregulate their spatial planning under the Agricultural Land Act, the Forest Act and the Urban Planning Act. Via this funding and deregulation, they can plan recovery-related projects for disaster prevention: the promotion of collective relocation, functional reinforcement of fishery villages, land reallocation for the revival of affected city areas, basic construction to lead city centers towards recovery from the tsunami and disaster-resistant public housing. The Act on Town Planning for Tsunami Disaster Prevention 2011 allows prefectural governments to set tsunami hazard zones and municipal governments to make integrated town plans for tsunami disaster prevention. Under the act, prefectural governments can set the presumed tsunami hazard zones and special tsunami warning zones. In the latter zone, normal town planning and building activities are restricted. \u00a9 2016 Yuka KANEKO, Katsumi MATSUOKA and Toshihisa TOYODA.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Matsuoka K.","DOI":"10.4324\/9781315680323-25","x":9.1999998093,"y":5.8400001526},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":336,"Cited by":null,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Formulation of design criteria based on recognition and comparison of user patterns of behavior, emphasizing on the role of climate in urban public spaces, case studies: Shahr-E-Kord and Bushehr","Abstract":"Introduction: Climate has always been one the main factors of designing urban spaces in Iran since past centuries. By analyzing urban spaces it can be concluded that different cities have different urban spaces due to climate differences. One of the main reasons of the differences in the type and orientation of urban spaces is the climate as one of the key factors in designing these areas. Regarding climate in designing is equivalent to involving the users of the space, basically because climate adjustments can encourage more people to use the designed spaces. Hence, it can be said that climatic spaces are humanistic spaces as well. Therefore, climate directly influence culture and plays a decisive role both in the body and behavior of the users. Thus, it could have a very effective role in how people use or how they behave in designed spaces. Materials and methods: A mix of several methods has been used for more compatibility with research purposes. This used library documents and has a comparative-analytical method. The basic data and the research background information have been gathered through documentative method and from library resources. For the fieldwork, the descriptive method (describing the phenomenon) has been used. Then, people patterns of behaviors were studied by an interpretative-qualitative method in each climate to analyze and infer the discussions in order. And at last, a comparative method has been used to analyze the results in order to set out urban design criteria. In this comparative method, it was tried to compare people patterns of behavior in two cold-mountainous, and hot and humid climates, and to analyze its results to elicit criteria for urban space design considering the effects of climate on the user behaviors. In this research, the people behaviors were studied, analyzed and compared in two different seasons of the year (the hottest and the coldest seasons) by the use of serial photography. Thus, people different patterns of behaviors in different climates and the ways they use the spaces were investigated, by the observation a set of design criteria could be developed to be applied in the design\/redesign of urban spaces to improve their qualities. (Figure Presented) The theory In general, people uses of urban spaces may have two stages: 1. Presence in urban space. 2. Tendency to continue to stay in the urban space. There are two kinds of qualities in urban environment. First, the qualities which are the main requirements of people presence in public spaces, i.e. primary qualities. Second, the qualities encouraging people to stay in the space for a longer time. Meanwhile, there are some qualities like climatic comfort which play effective role in both primary and secondary qualities. This very important factor is in full adaptation with human physical characteristics and is the main requirement of people presence in the space. It also plays an undeniable role in the way people use the space and behave there. Climatic comfort can increase the number of opportunities to use the space. If the space is designed with consideration of all aspects, including the user behaviors, it can be used by all people in various periods of time during the day, and in different seasons. Results and discussion: Design guidelines in hot and humid climate are formulated. They emphasize on the role of climate to determine people patterns of behavior. Here, regarding the achievements of local observations and the recognition, the design criteria are proposed at two different scales, the city scale and the site scale. A) The city scale: Location of the space in the shade: This is the most important factor affecting the use of space in hot and humid climates. If the open space includes shaded parts, people preference to stay there will increase. Therefore, location in the shade can be considered as an important requirement for people use of space in this climate. Other factor is natural ventilation and the space orientation parallel to the wind flows: This is the second factor affecting the use of public spaces in hot and humid climate. Natural ventilation of open spaces happens by the airflows coming from the sea. It helps the locals reduce the high unpleasant humidity in this climate, so it encourages passersby to stop and stay in the space. B) The site scale: \u2022 To avoid designing vast urban open spaces in hot and humid climate. \u2022 Making orientation of the open spaces toward the sea to moderate the hot weather and reduce the humidity by the sea airflows. Local observations also verify that successful spaces in this climate have perpendicular orientation to the sea to benefit from its cool airflows for natural ventilation. Formulating design guidelines in cold and mountainous climate emphasizes the role of climate to determine people pattern of behavior: Local observations in Shahr-E-Kord show that the two fallowing factors have determined the role of people use of space in cold and mountainous climate. 1-Maximizing the direct sunshine: It is a positive point for the open spaces in the cold winter weather of mountainous climate, because it helps the space to be more welcoming and favorable for people. 2-Not to be windward: This factor also has direct effect on how people attend and behave in the space. The researcher's observations and notes in cold and mountainous climate show that the spaces which are exposed to direct wind flows are not favorable for people. A) The city scale: \u2022 For designing open spaces and its proposed land uses, it is better to locate attractive uses at the southern and east-southern side of the space, because it helps to provide favorable sunlight for the space during cold winter days and facilitates the use of space for people. \u2022 In the cold and mountainous climate, it is better to design urban spaces in form of small squares because it reduces the entrance of wind flows and provides people with climatic comfort. It must be mentioned that vast squares in this climate can benefit from the increased direct sunlight and heat. But the effect of the increased airflows in these spaces is highly unfavorable and disturbs the climatic comfort. Thus, they are not recommended. B) The site scale: \u2022 It is better to design crowded spaces as semi-open spaces, because enclosed and covered spaces are more favorable in all seasons for their shelters from the sun, wind, rain and snow. \u2022 In cold climates, it is important to use types of plants which prevent spaces from undesired wind, while not casting shades during cold seasons, since trees can provide favorable shades for summer time. Conclusion: The results and findings of this research are presented in a set of operational and applicable recommendations, some of which might seem unimportant. But they are undeniably essential. Simple solutions for ordinary problems of existing urban spaces can lead to significant improvements in the space vitality and people social life. William White expresses the extract of his long term studies in one sentence: \"people seat where the seating exists.\" This sentence might seem clear and typical, but it is very important and can notably change the life of a city. Thus, the simplicity of changes does not mean that they are inconsiderable. It might be possible to change the destination of a space simply by adding shelters and awnings or providing sunny spaces in cold and mountainous climates and shaded spaces in hot and humid ones.","Author Keywords":"Behavior patterns; Bushehr; Climate; Climatic comfort; Shahr-E-Kord","Authors":"Bahrainy S.H., Aghakarimi A.","DOI":null,"x":10.0500001907,"y":7.7199997902},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":338,"Cited by":null,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Editorial","Title":"Preface to Part 5","Abstract":"The chapters in this Part of the book are concerned what are amongst the most critical challenges facing contemporary cities and urban planning \u2013 how to support, understand and manage the cultural practices of urban populations.

The \u2018cultural turn\u2019 in town and spatial planning which emerged from the 1970s and 1980s has taken longer to establish itself than say in geography (Barnes 2001, Crang 1997), political economy (Soja 1999) and sociology (Chaney 1994). Planning as a hybrid practice has adopted culture - at least partially - to better inform more sustainable approaches to scarce land use and amenity needs and to respond to diversity and planning cultures. On the other hand it has also rediscovered culture in order to address aspirations and visions of city planning itself as a \u2018work of art\u2019 (Boyer 1988, Munro 1967, Talen and Ellis 2004). Different approaches and rationales for cultural planning have therefore emerged, rather than a single grand theory or conceptual model (see also Bianchini, Chapter 22, this volume). This is in part due to the epistemological and definitional differences evident in these approaches towards \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018planning\u2019 and their combination, and in part to cultural politics that views the very idea of planning for culture as inherently instrumental in maintaining cultural and growth hegemonies - both market and state-led. Kunzmann\u2019s aspiration (above) towards creativity in planning also conflates the practice of town planners withcomplex notions of city culture, environment and identity. The notion of the creative city has also extended the cultural planning sphere to the creative industries (\u2018economy\u2019) and issues of place-making, design quality and sustainability. Place-making - like New Urbanism (CEU 2004) - whilst usefully focusing on the street, urban design, mixed-use, local accessibility, \u2018sense of place\u2019 and so on, can also be seen as a rejection or failure of planning in terms of the wider scale and the whole, distributed population (Evans 2010). Everywhere is a \u2018place\u2019, not just the valorized spaces which tend to feature in place-making agendas and guidance (APA 2011, Markusen and Gadwa 2010), and which are preoccupied with town centres and regeneration sites (physical, economy) at the expense of the everyday, residential areas and cultural activity (people). \u00a9 2013 Greg Young and Deborah Stevenson.

He uses transportable models and moving workshops as a way to involve citizens in the urban planning process. He takes a medley of recycled materials of vibrant colors and varied shapes, textures, and sizes to urban neighborhoods, street corners and public locations. By setting up these interactive models in publicly accessible locations, he encourages curious participants to use their hands and minds to experiment and create models of their ideal city, street, public space, or building. These mobile and on site events take the planning process directly to the people. By giving them the opportunity to have a 'hands-on' experience in envisioning their city, workshops help participants feel more connected to the urban landscape that surrounds them. These experiences set the groundwork for them to get involved in urban planning, and can help provide policy makers, urban planners, and architects with tools for information gathering. \u00a9 Arijit Sen and Jennifer Johung 2013.

Considering both cultural norms of public behavior and the municipal regulation of behavior in public, it shows how commonplace acts in everyday public spaces like sidewalks, streets, and parks work to establish neighborhood legitimacy for newcomers while delegitimizing once authentic public practices of long-timers. With evidence drawn from the formerly Latino neighborhood of Highland in Denver, Colorado, this ethnographic study demonstrates how the regulation of public space plays a pivotal role in neighborhood change. First, there is often a profound disharmony between how people from different cultural complexes interpret and sanction behavior in everyday public spaces. Second, because regulations, codes, urban design, and enforcement protocols are deliberately changed, commonplace activities longtime neighborhood residents feel they have a right to do along sidewalks and streets and within their neighborhood parks sometimes unexpectedly misalign with what is actually possible or legal to do in these publicly accessible spaces. \u00a9 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.","Author Keywords":"Gentrification; Governance; Neighborhood change; Public space; Urban planning; Urban sociology; Urban studies; US west","Authors":"Langegger S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-41177-4","x":7.8899998665,"y":7.9400000572},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":342,"Cited by":null,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Creative placemaking","Abstract":"Creative placemaking is a new way of engaging creative people and activities to address social and economic issues in communities.

In home culture research, Quitzau and R\u00f8pke has studied bathroom transformation from hygiene to well-being. Bathrooms are one of the rooms in apartments that do not have good solutions for small spaces. This is unfortunate since it is the bathroom that has the least amount of space in urban apartments. This leads many people to have too little bathroom space due to furniture, toilets, showers, etc. In today's society, the bathroom is no longer just a purpose room. It is used for relaxation and wellness. This has led to a trend where large furniture, such as freestanding bathtubs, dominate today's market. This in turn allows the few solutions that exist for small bathrooms to remain poorly conceived. The research question was therefore how to create solutions for small bathrooms to get the same sense of well-being as in larger bathrooms through universal design principals. The principles of universal design, observations and in-depth interviews were used in the study. This study can help to create a greater understanding of how to design small bathrooms.

The case of Gdynia","Abstract":"Continuity is today seen as one of the important values of architecture and urban planning. Keeping and preserving the legacy of the past is a strong tendency today and it includes also the legacy of Modernism. Yet, as time goes on, changes appear inevitable. The case is, how to make them a good continuation in terms of architecture and culture. Conversion in the heritage of Modern Movement often concerns both the structure of the buildings and their function. It mainly focuses on extension, renovation or rebuilding the old structure. Those actions usually achieve their functional and economic goals, but the architectural results are often more debatable. The article presents three examples of \"continuity by change\" in modern architecture of Gdynia: the extension of the City Market Halls carried out in the 1991; the renovation of the Marine Station conducted in 2013-14; and the partial demolition and rebuilding of the Oil Plant executed in 2011-2014. All those buildings are valuable examples of Modern Movement heritage, and two are listed. During the conversion they changed both, their function and architectural form, but the visual effects in every case differed from good to not satisfactory. That was because the final results of such actions depended not only on the talent and knowledge of the architect, but also on the level of sensitivity and collaboration between the other 4 actors which took part in those changes: the owners; the local authorities; the conservationists; and the local society. In conclusion, \"continuity by change\" in Modern Movement heritage may give a wonderful opportunity for architecture and for cultural heritage. However, it demands much effort from all people in charge, including the developer and the local society. Yet, it is the only proper way to avoid the still frequent fate of many valuable buildings of modern legacy-negligence and disruption. \u00a9 Pola Virgioli, 2016.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"So\u0142tysik M.","DOI":null,"x":9.5799999237,"y":5.1399998665},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":348,"Cited by":null,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Divided we stand: The Indian city afer economic liberalisation","Abstract":"In the wake of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, the Indian city has displaced the village in public imagination as the quintessence of India as rising, modern global power.

The city roils with a sweaty, gritty, creative energy, yet it has struggled to find a creative solution to overcoming its challenging past. As a global center of commerce and trade, the prosperity of the United States relies heavily on Memphis, yet Memphis is home to some of the nation\u2019s most impoverished communities. The city is stretched geographically, fiscally, and socially in so many directions that gaining a sense of unity around any shared cultural ideal is a daunting exercise, one that Memphis has only recently begun to undertake. This chapter explores the emergence of \u201csustainability\u201d in policy making and cultural perceptions in Memphis through conversations and controversies surrounding a proposal to institute a multi-use trail network across a geophysical landscape marked by socioeconomic and racial segregation. As Wanda Rushing (2009) puts it, \u201cfor more than one hundred years, changing views of space and place, conflicting values of \u2018progress\u2019 and preservation, as well as divisions of race, class, and gender have affected the physical and symbolic production of urban landscapes in Memphis\u201d (Rushing 2009). How does the concept of \u201csustainability\u201d as a social ideal play into the policies and decision making that are going to shape the future of a global city mired in a history of especially poor race relations, white flight, and cultural isolationism? A conversation on \u201csustainability\u201d cannot occur without first dismantling a racialized \u201cculture of fear\u201d that impacts nearly every aspect of urban life in Memphis (Glassner 2000). To accomplish this, we dissect the discourses and practices associated with \u201ccommunity\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d as they relate to transportation policy, urban planning, and alternative transportations infrastructure projects. We demonstrate how \u201csafety\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d take on different meanings, even in adjoining neighborhoods, and provide ethnographic snapshots of people and communities affecting (or affected by) various connectivity and livability projects. \u00a9 Cambridge University Press 2015.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Farr M.A., Brondo K.V., Anglin S.","DOI":"10.1017\/CBO9781139923316.020","x":7.6900000572,"y":7.8099999428},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":354,"Cited by":null,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The urban environment design and environmental pollution effects to the health","Abstract":"Urban environment Design is the core of the urban construction, urban environment can beautify the city, promote the city culture, improve people's standard of living.

Case study of Poznan, Poland","Abstract":"The paper deals with the questions of a public space creation through the implementation of art and design. The idea of promotion the cultural features within a public space helps to increase the city space attractiveness. The author presents the case study of a downtown area of a city of Poznan in Poland, Wielkopolska region. As a result of an observation that there is a lack of a public space of culture and art in Poznan city centre, there is presented a proposal of an innovative and attractive functions implementation. There is also presented the research method of public space activization through art and design. The art is understood not only as temporary events but as the pieces of a small architecture and built areas of a cultural function as well. There was created an idea of a MAD city for people - which means searching for meaning, action and design in a city centre space. This idea is to be used as a tool to identify the existing and potential space for art in a city centre and to define whether it is a space of sacrum or of profanum. The tool helps to define what is the best use and purpose of a space in a context of an art implementation. It is also to create a functional system of socially and spatially attractive public spaces within a city centre. \u00a9 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

Diesel\/electric locomotives, which populate urban rail corridors, have heavy load requirements and are industrial and\/or utilitarian in appearance. However, diesel multiple units (DMUs) with lighter weight, increased fuel efficiency, ease of accessibility, additional capacity, enhanced performance and lower costs are competing for their market share. Currently, monorails, people movers, and streetcars - along with the traditional light and heavy rail systems - have public acceptance to enrich the urban environments surrounding the existing corridors, and enhance commuter experience. Many cities, however, are at a crossroads regarding transitioning from an automobile culture to a rail culture.

For landscape architects and urban designers this presents both the challenge of multiple 'sense of place'' and the opportunity to create a unique notion of 'intercultural places' that generate an environment that people of all cultures can have associative relationship with. This paper explores the notion of Cultural Literacy and the impacts of design decisions on the cultural life of Australia's diverse communities. Methods Cultural Literacy can be understood as the ability to read, understand, find significance, evaluate and compare local cultures. As Lefebvre [1996] states \"Cultural Literacy can be seen as the skill base associated with understanding both the encoding and decoding required to develop culturally meaningful products, places or programs\". The paper will present a cultural literacy framework for seeing, planning and designing through an intercultural lens. Results By understanding the communities multiple 'place narratives' and seeing things through an intercultural lens it is possible to plan and develop more inclusive and culturally sensitive public spaces. Conclusions As culture is what gives meaning to our lives then everything we do should have a cultural dimension. Therefore, all planning is or at least should be cultural, and be at the very centre of thinking about cities, not just about our social or civic life but also about the environment, infrastructure and economics of the city. The presenter will explore the potential of responsive planning and understanding the consequences and implications of urban planning on a community's cultural life and highlight a range of Cultural Literacy tools for planners and urban designers.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Brecknock R.","DOI":null,"x":6.9800000191,"y":7.6799998283},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":1,"DocId":369,"Cited by":null,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Simple discussion on creating a historical and cultural concept on city square design - Exemplified by hundred miles of the Yellow River in Lanzhou","Abstract":"City square, as a major public urban space.

Good architecture and urban design contribute to making cities both functional and attractive to residents and visitors. While architecture is about the design of buildings, urban design is about the relationships between the buildings, the roads and spaces that they front, and the people who make use of them. The outstanding building projects are those that are not only visually stimulating, but are also sensitive and respectful of their surrounding developments and environment. A well-designed city takes into consideration this important relationship between buildings and the beauty of the city as a whole. Socialization is the process that prepares humans to function in social life. It should be re-iterated here that socialization is culturally relative - people in different cultures are socialized differently. The process of socializing or sociability in a city means acquiring the model of style life of that city. The process of socializing includes every daily activities of citizens' life. People have mutual relationship in this place and actualize it through presenting the municipal cultural and social activities and resolving the needs of each other.

Indigenous knowledge refers to both component and whole part of culture of each nation and this component and whole integration is so that stop to change traditional society of life without indigenous knowledge out of its cultural origin and therefore would lose it concept and effectiveness. in recent decades following issues had been recognized very essential: programming and performing development plans, indigenous knowledge at farming, pest control, ranching, veterinary, nutrition, medicine, watershed management, foresting, architecture, urban planning, social associations and decision making method as sustainable technology. At on hand, reason of this great evolution can be found due to wrong policy and at the other hand in undesirable environmental consequences of these policies. Indigenous knowledge is different with scientific knowledge that was established by universities and scientific communities. This knowledge is basis for decision making at field of agriculture, health, education, food and natural sources Indigenous knowledge is set of all knowledge and skills that people enjoy in one geographical area (in one environmental conditions) that most of their skills and knowledge be transmitted to next generation, and new generation would be adapted with them and add to it Since, each knowledge is consequent of individual interaction with environment, so indigenous knowledge is consequent of indigenous people interaction with their environment.","Author Keywords":"Agriculture; Indigenous knowledge","Authors":"Arjmandi H., Mardani H., Nazeri M.","DOI":null,"x":8.6499996185,"y":5.4800000191},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":374,"Cited by":null,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Effective solution to improve citizenship education as a part of culture identity, citizenship, sustainability","Abstract":"One of the factors of growth and prosperity of cities in developed countries leading role of citizens in determining their fate.

The evaluative content of a livable city came out more earlier in developed country, and got rapid development.Presently, the developed countries have set up one and another representatives of livable city, while China is still in the process of urbanization and industrialization.When we are cheering the tremendous success during the reformation, we should also realize the harm as a result of those achievements to environment.So, a livable city has become the development target by more and more cities.When evaluating a livable city, we should make sure the evaluation indices system.Presently?relevant researches of theory about the evaluation indices from home and aboard are based on economic, society, environment, landscape, culture, safety and so on. Those data are gathered either statistic or through questionnaire and investigate. While livable city is a complex system with biological integrality, just one or two outstanding indices can not show that the residential environment is on a high level.Therefore, the paper sets up the evaluative framework and method of a livable city focusing on remote sensing data. Then discusses how to gather and choose information with RS and GIS technique, confirm the definitions, quantify all the indices to make them meaningful and comparative.And when we are choosing their indices, we should take account of the way of how to get these data, the method of handling and quantifying those information.The index system based on multi-scale remote sensing information includes contents as follows: traffic density and convenience, distribution and volume ratio of urban buildings, analysis on the landscape pattern of urban green-space and ecological construction, spatial configuration of urban city, urban heat effect, monitoring and evaluation of wetland area, assessment of ecological environment and security, vegetation fraction estimation, distribution of infrastructures, land use and land cover, terrain and physiognomy, geological disaster-prone area analysis, water conservation district, urban open area and so an.And the paper integrates these information with that of non-remote sensing, such as people's identify with the residential environment, amenity of nature environment, convenience of public establishment, satisfaction of human relations and so on.After analyzing, quantifying and evaluating those data, the paper then brings forward a comprehensive index system.Moreover, the paper presents the comprehensive evaluation model aiming to assess the residential environment of Chongqing city. The model includes a large amount of factors-factors on remote sensing and other assistant factors coming from statistic data.When building the model, we should take the consistency and standardization process between different remote sensing data, and between remote sensing data with non-remote sensing data into account, also the independence, representative and importance of these factors.Therefore, we should analyze and evaluate all the factors to make sure the remarkable ones, eliminate redundancy information, and make certain the power of the factors which are used in the model.Thus, the paper sets up the comprehensive evaluation model, and does researches and evaluation on the residential environment.

On the contrary, the Mongolian government thinks otherwise as they want to end this nomadic national identity as it is being seen as a \"culture of poverty\". The Brazilian government has been criticized by Janice Perlman for pulling away the settlements of these nomads as she believes that these community can be a vibrant part of the urban. Meanwhile, Mongolian pastoralists can only afford a \"ger\" which is a wood-frame felt tent that can be assembled within hours. The traditional way of life can be seen whenever these \"gers\" are seen within the vicinity. However, people who are living in such \"ger\" suburbs are neither considered nomads or an urban dweller. It is also strange to hear the concept of planning for nomadism as they themselves do not plan at all and that planning for them involves such critical decisions. As Mongolia adapts this nomads, it provides a lifestyle that can be sustained and challenges the link between poverty and informality and gives an understanding of the peripheral space.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Tao W.","DOI":null,"x":8.1099996567,"y":5.4899997711},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":381,"Cited by":null,"Year":2007,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Words and music","Abstract":"Aboriginals-related publications in Taiwan are becoming richer in content and style due to the growing concerns for aboriginal issues and the effort to promote aboriginal cultures.

The Maya Empire established a scientifically based culture while Europe languished in the Dark Ages. During their classic period, the Maya developed numerous scientific and engineering advancements. These ingenious people developed a mathematical system that recognized the concept of the number zero seven hundred years before the Europeans; a calendar system that is more advanced than our current calendar; ingenious engineering applications including manufacturing of cement, clear span cast-in-place concrete structures; and a complex infrastructure that served the needs of their sophisticated and highly populated ceremonial urban centers. Around 700 AD the Maya achieved an exceptional feat in civil engineering history with the construction of a long-span suspension bridge across the Usumacinta River at the ceremonial center at Yaxchilan.

To this end the Ministry of Water Resources published the first National Water Policy in 1999,whereas the paper focuses the Regional Water Management Plan (RWMP) with the intention of guiding both public and private actions in the future for ensuring optimal development and management of water that benefits both individuals and the society at large. This Paper aims to ensure progress towards fulfilling national goals of economic development, poverty alleviation, food security, public health and safety, decent standard of living for the people and protection of the natural environment. The Plan is presented in three phases: in the short-term (2000-05) it is considered a firm plan of ongoing and new activities; in the medium-term (2006-10) it is an indicative plan, and in the long-term (2011-25) a perspective plan. Implementation of the plan is to be monitored regularly and it will be updated every five years (IWRM, 2002). Water is central to the way of life in Bangladesh. Indeed, the river systems, many of which emanate from outside the country, have shaped much of the history, economy, literature and rich culture of the people. However, with a burgeoning population of 129 million expected to rise to 181 million by 2025 and to 224 million by 2050 (IWRM, 2002), the country faces many challenges ahead in an era of increasing globalization. Rapid urbanization is expected with 40% of people living in the towns and major cities by 2025, and 60% by 2050 (WARPO, 2001). Poverty is still endemic with over half the population classified as poor. In addressing these and other related issues, this paper sets new paradigms for the water sector, which include: decentralized water management; cost sharing and cost recovery; private sector participation; community participation; nontraditional financing modalities; regulation separated from supply; and new rights, obligations and accountability.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Hafiz R., Chowdhury S., Sultana S.","DOI":null,"x":7.1999998093,"y":6.1599998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":390,"Cited by":null,"Year":2002,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Inter-organisational co-operation in improving access to activity centres by public transport","Abstract":"The accessibility to city centres and large attraction parks increasingly becomes an issue of concern for location owners.

In some respects, however, the problems are very different. Decades of having to endure a politically offensive system has created negative attitudes in the bulk of the population towards authority, and indeed towards service providers. These attitudes will not easily change. As the majority of people had not real involvement in governance in the evolving political system during the nineteen eighties they increasingly regarded all authority as illegitimate. An illegitimate system quite naturally had to be resisted and replaced. The objective of resistance was to make the country ungovernable and hence open to change. By withholding, initially, housing rental repayments to the State and, later, services payments to local authorities a powerful weapon was brought into play. But with it came many other attitude changes, currently referred to as a 'culture of non-payment', which the new democratic government is now forced to grapple with. The degree to which the levels of payment for water services can be improved to acceptable levels will be dependent in a general sense upon government's success in changing attitudes and, in particular, on water authorities persuasiveness in inducing customers to take responsibility for paying for services rendered.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Bath V.J.","DOI":null,"x":7.0199999809,"y":6.0300002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":393,"Cited by":null,"Year":1996,"Document Type":"Book","Title":"Tokyo life.
