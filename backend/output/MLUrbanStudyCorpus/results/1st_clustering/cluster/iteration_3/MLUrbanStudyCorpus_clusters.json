The spatial configuration of land cover has recently become an important aspect of the study of geomorphological processes related to erosion within watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of soil erosion and sediment yield to land cover patterns in watersheds. However, many landscape metrics are highly correlated and may result in redundancy, which violates the assumptions of a traditional least-squares approach, thus leading to singular solutions or otherwise biased parameter estimates and confidence intervals. Here, we investigated the landscape patterns within watersheds in the Upper Du River watershed (8973km2) in China and examined how the spatial patterns of land cover are related to the soil erosion and sediment yield of watersheds using hydrological modeling and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The results indicate that the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield are closely associated with the land cover patterns. At the landscape level, landscape characteristics, such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), contagion (CONTAG), and patch cohesion index (COHESION), were identified as the primary metrics controlling the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield. The landscape characteristics in watersheds could account for as much as 65% and 74% of the variation in soil erosion and sediment yield, respectively. Greater interspersion and an increased number of patch land cover types may significantly accelerate soilerosion and increase sediment export. PLSR can be used to simply determine the relationships between land-cover patterns and watershed soil erosion and sediment yield, providing quantitative information to allow decision makers to make better choices regarding landscape planning. With readily available remote sensing data and rapid developments in geographic information system (GIS) technology, this practical and simple PLSR approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Co-dependent data; Landscape metrics; Sediment delivery ratio; Sediment yield; Soil erosion","Authors":"Shi Z.H., Ai L., Li X., Huang X.D., Wu G.L., Liao W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2013.06.031","x":5.2899999619,"y":5.5999999046},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":10,"Cited by":94.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urbanization impact on landscape patterns in Beijing City, China: A spatial heterogeneity perspective","Abstract":"The temporal and spatial characteristics of landscape pattern change can reflect the spatial impact of urbanization on the ecological environment. Studying the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns can provide supports for urban ecological management. Previous studies have examined the quantitative relationship between the social economy and landscape patterns of an entire region, but have not considered the spatial non-stability of this relationship. In this study, we characterized the landscape patterns in Beijing City, China during 2000 and 2010 using four landscape metrics, i.e. patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the aggregation index (AI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity and evolution characteristics of the relationship between the urbanization of population density (POP), gross domestic production (GDP) and nighttime lighting (NTL), and landscape patterns. The evolution of urban landscape patterns indicated a decentralized, aggregated, and fragmented change from the downtown to the suburb and outer suburb. During the 10-year period, the average PD in the downtown increased by 100.6%, and the increase of AI in the suburb was the largest. The PD, ED and SHDI increased by different degrees in the outer suburb. The influences of different urbanization modes on landscape patterns were also different. Infilling mode made the landscape patterns more regular and integrated. The landscape was more broken and complicated under the edge-expanding mode, and the leapfrog mode made PD and SHDI increase slightly. In the relationship interpretation, GWR effectively identified the spatial heterogeneity, and improved the explanatory ability compared to ordinary least squares (OLS). The most intense response to urbanization was the forest landscape and the forest-cultivated land ecotone in the northwest of Beijing City, indicating that this region was ecologically fragile. The population density in the urbanization index had a direct effect on landscape patterns, while the PD affected by urbanization was greater than the shape, aggregation and diversity index. Affected by development policy, urban planning and other factors, the explanation degree of social economy to landscape patterns decreased in 2010. GWR is an effective method for quantifying the spatial differentiation characteristics of urbanization impacts on landscape patterns, which can provide more spatial information and decision criteria for the green development of a compact city. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Compact green city Beijing City, China; GWR; Landscape metrics;Urbanization mode","Authors":"Huilei L., Jian P., Yanxu L., Yi'na H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ecolind.2017.06.032","x":5.5599999428,"y":5.3600001335},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":14,"Cited by":86.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Using image recognition to automate assessment of cultural ecosystem services from social media photographs","Abstract":"Quantifying and mapping cultural ecosystem services is complex because of their intangibility. Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems.

This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm \u2013 Google Cloud Vision \u2013 to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20% of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas.

The main objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of dust storms to PM10 concentrations in a desert urban center, the city of Beer-Sheva, Negev, Israel, during the period of 2001-2012. Toward this end, a background value based on the \"dust-free\" season was used as a threshold value to identify potentially \"dust days.\" Subsequently, the net contribution of dust storms to PM10 was assessed. During the study period, daily PM10 concentrations ranged from 6 to over 2000 \u03bcg\/m3. In each year, over 10% of the daily concentrations exceeded the calculated threshold (BVt) of 71 \u03bcg\/m3. An average daily net contribution of dust to PM10 of 122 \u03bcg\/m3 was calculated for the entire study period based on this background value. Furthermore, a dust storm intensity parameter (Ai) was used to analyze several storms with very high PM10 contributions (hourly averages of 1000-5197 \u03bcg\/m3). This analysis revealed that the strongest storms occurred mainly in the last 3 yr of the study. Finally, these findings indicate that this arid urban environment experiences high PM10 levels whose origin lies in both local and regional dust events.

Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Accessible greenery; Google Street View; Human-scale; Machine learning; Space syntax; Visible greenery","Authors":"Ye Y., Richards D., Lu Y., Song X., Zhuang Y., Zeng W., Zhong T.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.028","x":5.5599999428,"y":4.6100001335},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":35,"Cited by":40.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban water resource management for sustainable environment planning using artificial intelligence techniques","Abstract":"In the current era, water is a significant resource for socio-economic growth and the protection of healthy environments. Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence Markov process; Ecology; Environment management; Environment planning; Water","Authors":"Xiang X., Li Q., Khan S., Khalaf O.I.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.eiar.2020.106515","x":3.4600000381,"y":3.5899999142},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":36,"Cited by":39.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Mapping urban form and function at city block level using spatial metrics","Abstract":"This paper focuses on the potential of urban metrics describing the presence and the configuration of built-up and open space areas for mapping distinct types of urban form and function at city block level.

As the emission sources or adsorption sinks, land use and the corresponding landscape pattern unavoidably affect the concentration. However, the correlation varies with different regions and scales, leaving a significant gap for urban planning. This study clarifies the correlation with the aid of in situ and satellite-based spatial datasets over six urban agglomerations in China. Two coverage and four landscape indices are adopted to represent land use and landscape pattern. Specifically, the coverage indices include the area ratios of forest (F_PLAND) and built-up areas (C_PLAND). The landscape indices refer to the perimeter-area fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Then, the correlation between PMPM2.5 concentration with the selected indices are evaluated from supporting the potential urban planning. Results show that the correlations are weak with the in situ PMPM2.5 concentration, which are significant with the regional value. It means that land use coverage and landscape pattern affect PMPM2.5 at a relatively large scale. Furthermore, regional PMPM2.5 concentration negatively correlate to F_PLAND and positively to C_PLAND (significance at p &lt; 0.05), indicating that forest helps to improve air quality, while built-up areas worsen the pollution. Finally, the heterogeneous landscape presents positive correlation to the regional PMPM2.5 concentration in most regions, except for the urban agglomeration with highly-developed urban (i.e., the Jing-Jin-Ji and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations). It suggests that centralized urbanization would be helpful for PMPM2.5 pollution controlling by reducing the emission sources in most regions. Based on the results, the potential urban planning is proposed for controlling PMPM2.5 pollution for each urban agglomeration.","Author Keywords":"China; Land use; Landscape; PMPM2.5 concentration; Spatial variability","Authors":"Feng H., Zou B., Tang Y.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs9090918","x":4.9899997711,"y":5.5100002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":0,"DocId":49,"Cited by":32.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The spatial characteristics and relationships between landscape pattern and ecosystem service value along an urban-rural gradient in Xi'an city, China","Abstract":"The spatial structure and function of Xi'an city is significantly affected by urbanization, a factor which can be considered as the main driver of landscape pattern and ecosystem service change.

Combined with urban planning theory, concentric buffer zones were used to explore the characteristics and relationships between LPIs and ESVs along an urban-rural gradient. Ten landscape indices and nine ecosystem service types were selected to analyze the correlation and construct multiple linear regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate the problem of multi-collinearity in the process of model construction. Results indicate that the highest landscape fragmentation was mainly distributed in the urban-rural fringe, 20\u201335 km from the urban center, and patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and landscape shape index (LSI) recorded the highest values.

In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and \"interpretability\". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of \"regional centers\" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs.

It is not that the higher the bus station coverage is, the better for residents to travel as low-carbon, and the high popularity of public transportation in small cities will increase the carbon emission of residents.

Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Daily accessed street greenery; Housing price; Human scale; New urban data; Shanghai; Street view images","Authors":"Ye Y., Xie H., Fang J., Jiang H., Wang D.","DOI":"10.3390\/su11061741","x":5.3499999046,"y":4.8099999428},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":103,"Cited by":16.0,"Year":2005,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Capturing impressions of pedestrian landscapes used for healing purposes with decision tree learning","Abstract":"In 2002, Medicare health insurance recognized the relationship between pedestrian environments and public health by providing co-pay for health care delivered in residential land use. In this multi-disciplinary experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA) bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical activity levels with the associated health benefits. A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area. A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of individual or group of these variables to better understand how the built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes. This collaboration was our first phase in developing intelligent tools for designers that provided site-specific user-specific data to the planner or designer of pedestrian space.","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Multi-disciplinary design analysis, Walking for health; Pedestrian landscapes; User evaluation","Authors":"Naderi J.R., Raman B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2004.11.012","x":5.3099999428,"y":4.0199999809},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":128,"Cited by":11.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"The conceptual basis of water-energy-food nexus governance: systematic literature review using network and discourse analysis","Abstract":"In the last decade, the debate on the governance of water, energy, and food (WEF) has intensified, spurring the emergence of the term \u201cnexus governance.\u201d In general, the reduction of trade-offs and construction of synergies between WEF have been placed on the scientific, political, and economic agenda.

Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment. For decades they have learned how to use census data, which is comprehensive on several basic variables, but is only conducted once per decade so is almost always out of date. More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009). Planners are still being trained in methods that are suitable for a data poor environment (J Plan Educ Res 6:10\u201321, 1986; Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data: the big data revolution!, 101\u2013104, 2011; J Plan Educ Res 15:17\u201333, 1995). In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape. We will discuss how these methods can be integrated into the planning curriculum as well as planning practice. \u00a9 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Author Keywords":"Analytics; Big data; Education; Urban planning; Visualization","Authors":"French S.P., Barchers C., Zhang W.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-40902-3_12","x":3.9400000572,"y":4.5},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":142,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Predictive analytics can facilitate proactive property vacancy policies for cities","Abstract":"Is it possible for a city to understand, analyze, predict, and therefore prevent vacant properties?

Thus, it is important to examine park accessibility and how it changes over time in relation to community deprivation so as to provide all residents with equitable services. Using the Gaussian-based 2SFCA (two-step floating catchment area) method, this paper analyzes dynamic park accessibility from 2016 to 2018 for communities within the Hangzhou metropolitan area in China and then quantifies the relative role of local contributors to park accessibility changes (population, park and transport network). A machine learning algorithm, which handles the interdependences of deprivation dimensions, is further employed to determine the relationship between community deprivation and park accessibility changes. Results show that park accessibility continued to grow during the study period, and most communities achieved excellent park accessibility by 2018. Population decreases and park increases contribute positively to improved park accessibility, while transport network changes have had less of an impact. Deprived communities have observed a rising trend of park accessibility, while the elderly concentrated communities are more likely to experience declined park accessibility. Our study provides a new methodological framework, which integrates the geographical accessibility model, economic chain substitution model and machine learning algorithm, for understanding the dynamic park access and associated social inequalities in rapidly urbanizing regions. The lessons learned from this study should be insightful for urban planning. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Accessibility; Dynamic changes; Green spaces; Hangzhou; Neighborhood SES; Park; Social deprivation","Authors":"Li Z., Wei H., Wu Y., Su S., Wang W., Qu C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2019.102031","x":5.1100001335,"y":4.9000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":146,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Multivariate relationships between campus design parameters and energy performance using reinforcement learning and parametric modeling","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%.

Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration scales","Abstract":"Understanding how urban forms affect fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations within different seasons is important for sustainable urban development. Thus, the purpose of this study was to quantify the relationships between urban forms and PM2.5 concentration change seasonally in 279 Chinese cities, with the explicit consideration of a comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration scales. A comprehensive evaluation index system of urban forms was calculated based on six urban form metrics (total urban area (CA), number of patches (NP), landscape shape index (LSI), percentage of like adjacencies (PLADJ), patch cohesion index (COHESION), and aggregation index (AI)) by integrating three control variables (temperature, NDVI, and nighttime light). The spatial regression model was subsequently adopted to quantify the effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations. The results revealed that, during the summer and autumn, only urban form compactness was significantly correlated with the PM2.5 concentrations, but more urban form metrics were significantly associated with the PM2.5 concentrations during the spring and winter in Chinese cities. The scattered urban form could effectively reduce the PM2.5 concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing but not in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei during the winter. The effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations become increasingly noticeable from the national scale to the urban agglomeration scale with seasonal change. This study suggests that the urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationships are sensitive to seasonal variations across different regions. Thus, it is an important approach to solve PM2.5 pollution problem to construct an ideal urban form through flexible urban planning strategies. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Chinese cities; Nighttime light; PM2.5 concentrations; Seasonal variation; Urban forms","Authors":"Shi K., Li Y., Chen Y., Li L., Huang C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jclepro.2019.118088","x":4.8499999046,"y":5.2800002098},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":167,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Urban Data Mining using emergent SOM","Abstract":"The term of Urban Data-Mining is defined to describe a methodological approach that discovers logical or mathematical and partly complex descriptions of urban patterns and regularities inside the data.

However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification (BAIC) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the BAIC were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the BAIC to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest (POI), Road Network (RN), nighttime light (NTL), a combination of POI and RN data (POI_RN), a combination of POI and NTL data (POI_NTL), a combination of RN and NTL data (RN_NTL), and a combination of POI, RN, and NTL data (POI_RN_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and AdaBoost. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 76 to 89%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95.

This study provides new evidence for the links between body mass index (BMI) and the BE at different geographic scales in a unified framework. Based on a sample of 10,962 individuals across 95 cities in China, this study explores the collective effects of the BE attributes at neighborhood and city levels on BMI using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach. Moreover, whether the relationships between the city-level BE attributes and BMI vary across social groups is revealed. The results indicate that the city-level BE attributes have larger collective effects on BMI than the neighborhood-level BE attributes. Specifically, population size is the greatest contributor to predicting BMI, with a relative importance of 13.92% among all influential factors. Moreover, it is found that the effects of city-level BE attributes vary across different social groups. These findings suggest it is of vital importance for urban planners to coordinate both neighborhood- and city-level BE planning to deter the risks of obesity, and urban planning can be more effective if it is implemented considering local socio-demographic characteristics. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Different geographic scales; Interactive effects; Machine learning method; Obesity; Relative importance","Authors":"Wang X., Shao C., Yin C., Guan L.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2020.103048","x":4.8600001335,"y":4.6999998093},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":209,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Comparison of Regression Tools for Regional Electric Load Forecasting","Abstract":"Urban area electrical load forecasting is important for power generation capacity planning and also to integrate environment friendly energy sources at district level. Load predictions will help in developing demand side management in coordination with renewable power generation. Urban area load is influenced by meteorological conditions therefore it is important to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting. This paper explores the use of regression tool for regional electric load forecasting by correlating lower distinctive categorical level (season and day of the week) and weather parameters. The historical electrical load datasets with meteorological parameters are available for the Sydney region and they have been used to test the regression tools. Data correlation over seasonal changes have been argued by means of improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE). By examining the structure of various regressors they are compared for the lowest MAPE. The regressors show good MAPE for short term (30 min) prediction and Random Forest Regressor scores best in the range of 1-2 % MAPE. \u00a9 2018 University of Split, FESB.","Author Keywords":"Electric Load Forecasting; k-NN; Machine Learning; Regression Tools","Authors":"Johannesen N.J., Kolhe M., Goodwin M.","DOI":null,"x":3.2699999809,"y":3.1400001049},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":227,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The big picture of cities: Analysing Flickr photos of 222 cities worldwide","Abstract":"The purpose of the current research is to introduce a new method involving machine learning that can identify and analyse the city image dimensions (CIDs) of cities worldwide.

It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3\u2212-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3\u2212-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Scenario planning; Urban form; Urban sprawl; Water quality","Authors":"Wang R., Kim J.-H., Li M.-H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.144057","x":3.4600000381,"y":3.7899999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":251,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Remote measurement of building usable floor area \u2013 Algorithms fusion","Abstract":"Rapid changes that are taking place in the urban environment have significant impact on urban growth.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Author Keywords":"Data-informed urban design; Greenway planning; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-sourced urban data","Authors":"Tang Z., Ye Y., Jiang Z., Fu C., Huang R., Yao D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ufug.2020.126871","x":5.0599999428,"y":3.9800000191},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":253,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"GIS-enabled digital twin system for sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions: A case study of Jeonju city, south Korea","Abstract":"Despite the growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project\u2014in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018.

First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization.

This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined.

Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields.

The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Automation of Everything (AoE); Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); Internet of Everything (IoE); Internet of Things (IoT); Internet-of-Drones (IoD); smart city","Authors":"Kuru K.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2020.3049094","x":5.6300001144,"y":2.1700000763},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":287,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Learning from urban form to predict building heights","Abstract":"Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. \u00a9 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

In particular, the decision process is the main component of every military operation and is of high interest because of two main reasons : it is necessary designed to cope with conflict issues and it requires a very complex planning process to be successful. The difficulty to find a good plan is worse in urban areas because of the high uncertainty due to the topology of these areas, the presence of civilians, who can be hostile or friendly, and the unpredictable nature of enemies. The idea in that paper is to qualify what can be a valid computed plan in that context, i.e. well-designed for recovering of peace, rescue operations after a bombing event, hostage salvage, non-combatant evacuation operations, civil-military co-operation, ., in urban areas. This planning process leads to associate actually four components, the representation of the tactical scheme, the implementation of the tactical scheme as the behaviour of special forces, military units or emergency squads, the proof process or the explanation process, and finally the handling of external factors depending on the current environment or the current context in which the operation takes place. This paper uses a quaternary representation called the epistemological quadriptych, in order to highlight that the integration of UGVs or UAVs devices requires actually to understand the role of knowledge and behaviour and to provide secure and valid action plans, i.e. which can be explained and justified.

It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Author Keywords":"big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning","Authors":"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.","DOI":"10.1002\/cpe.6316","x":3.5599999428,"y":2.9000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":326,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"An ensemble energy consumption forecasting model based on spatial-temporal clustering analysis in residential buildings","Abstract":"Due to the availability of smart metering infrastructure, high-resolution electric consumption data is readily available to study the dynamics of residential electric consumption at finely resolved spatial and temporal scales. Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer\u2019s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Under the backdrop of global urbanization, some cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters that are influenced by unplanned urban expansion. Rational planning of urban functional areas needs to be strengthened to improve the scientific approach of urban planning and urbanization. In this study, the classification of urban functional areas based on dual-modal data (i.e., remote sensing image and user behavior data) was implemented using machine learning (ML) algorithms. After the set test, the classification accuracy of urban functional areas reached 82.45%. Through analysis, it could be concluded that the use of data of two modalities achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by using data of a single modality. The data of the two modalities complement each other, and the use of ML algorithms to train such data can yield good results. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Classification of urban functional areas; convolutional neural network (CNN); light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM); multimodal data","Authors":"Chen C., Yan J., Wang L., Liang D., Zhang W.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2020.3044250","x":4.8099999428,"y":3.4000000954},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":343,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Enabling digital co-creation in urban planning and development","Abstract":"Co-creation is essential for urban planning.

Exploring the dynamics of urban greenness space and their driving forces can provide valuable information for making solid urban planning policies. This study aims to investigate the dynamics of urban greenness space patterns through landscape indices and to apply geographically weighted regression (GWR) to map the spatially varied impact on the indices from economic and environmental factors. Two typical landscape indices, i.e., percentage of landscape (PLAND) and aggregation index (AI), which measure the abundance and fragmentation of urban greenness coverage, respectively, were taken to map the changes in urban greenness. As a case study, the metropolis of Wuhan, China was selected, where time-series of urban greenness space were extracted at an annual step from the Landsat collections from Google Earth Engine during 2000\u20132018. The study shows that the urban greenness space not only decreased significantly, but also tended to be more fragmented over the years. Road network density, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), terrain elevation and slope, and precipitation were found to significantly correlate to the landscape indices. GWR modeling successfully captures the spatially varied impact from the considered factors and the results from GWR modeling provide a critical reference for making location-specific urban planning. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

In this paper, we investigate the nexus between station walkable catchments and forms of urbanity around transit nodes by adopting an assemblage approach to cut across any separation of sociality and spatiality. Drawing on empirical research from two case studies in Tehran, this paper contributes to studies on transit urban design by developing two measures of accessibility-the Catchment of Accessible Public Spaces (CAPS) and Accessible Interfaces (AI). We found that the combination of high CAPS and high AI within a given time can enable streetlife intensity, which is also linked to a synergistic effect of a larger assemblage, including the number of entries and diversity of functions. We argue that a focus on both measures is critical to understand the performance and potential transformation of street networks in a TOD. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Accessibility; Global south; Public space; Public\/private interface; Transit-oriented development; Urban design; Urban morphology; Urbanism; Urbanity; Walkability","Authors":"Peimani N., Kamalipour H.","DOI":"10.3390\/SU12083495","x":5.5999999046,"y":4.4400000572},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":380,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Accelerated exploration for long-term urban water infrastructure planning through machine learning","Abstract":"In this study, the neural network method (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) was integrated with an explorative model, to study the feasibility of using machine learning to reduce the exploration time but providing the same support in long-term water system adaptation planning.

Currently, community engagement for urban decision-making is often ineffective, uninformed, and only occurs in projects\u2019 later stages. To facilitate a more collaborative and evidence-based urban decision-making process for both experts and non-experts, real-time feedback and optimized suggestions are essential. However, most of the current tools for urban planning are neither capable of performing complex simulations in real-time nor of providing guidance for better urban performance. CityMatrix was introduced to address these challenges. Machine learning techniques were applied to achieve real-time prediction of multiple urban simulations, and thousands of city configurations were simulated. The simulation results were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the traffic and solar performance of unseen city configurations. The prediction with the CNN is thousands of times faster than the original simulations and maintains a high-quality representation of the results.

Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July\u2013December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning","Authors":"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2021.148406","x":4.1300001144,"y":5.2600002289},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":432,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Sustainable development scale of housing estates: An economic assessment using machine learning approach","Abstract":"Economic sustainability is often addressed from the perspective of economic growth and at the national level. In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. \u00a9 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Author Keywords":"density; housing; machine learning; threshold; urban planning","Authors":"Tang B.-S., Ho W.K.O., Wong S.W.","DOI":"10.1002\/sd.2168","x":4.3600001335,"y":4.3899998665},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":434,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Neural Network Based Algorithm for Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning","Abstract":"This paper proposes a method to tackle the Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem for a fleet of AI-driven UAVs while accounting for congestion, collision avoidance, and efficiency of the path.

For the case of the Jiangxia District and Huangpi District of Wuhan, image features, including perimeter, line segment detector (LSD), Hough transform, gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), histogram of oriented gradients (HoG), and local binary patterns (LBP), are calculated, and four machine learning approaches and 25 variables are applied to identify urban poverty and relatively important variables. The results show that image features and machine learning approaches can be used to identify urban poverty with the best model performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.5341 and 0.5324 for Jiangxia and Huangpi, respectively, although some differences exist among the approaches and study areas. The importance of each variable differs for each approach and study area; however, the relatively important variables are similar. In particular, four variables achieved relatively satisfactory prediction results for all models and presented obvious differences in varying communities with different poverty levels. Housing inequality within low-income neighborhoods, which is a response to gaps in wealth, income, and housing affordability among social groups, is an important manifestation of urban poverty. Policy makers can implement these findings to rapidly identify urban poverty, and the findings have potential applications for addressing housing inequality and proving the rationality of urban planning for building a sustainable society. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940.

Modelling of residential location choice of urban population with random forest","Abstract":"The most common approach to assessing natural hazard risk is investigating the willingness to pay in the presence or absence of such risk. In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus. Avenues for future research include the operational strengthening of these linkages for more effective disaster risk management. \u00a9 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience","Authors":"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-76059-5_24","x":3.6900000572,"y":4.2199997902},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":472,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Mapping essential urban land use categories (EULUC) using geospatial big data: Progress, challenges, and opportunities","Abstract":"Urban land use information that reflects socio-economic functions and human activities is critically essential for urban planning, landscape design, environmental management, health promotion, and biodiversity conservation.

This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata\u00a0model\u00a0uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical\u00a0flood\u00a0hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations.

Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles.

The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity.

It is widely used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, topographic mapping, agricultural censuses and disaster prevention. However, traditional satellite remote sensing is subject to high cost and long data acquisition cycles, and it is difficult for users to get the data in time. These problems result in insufficient data supply capacity of remote sensing satellites, which leads to difficulties in supporting daily business applications and establishing a fast-growing business model business models. The small satellite segment has seen rapid market growth and technological advancements since 2013 following the multiple successful launches, most notably the Planet, Spire and others. Economies of scale during production are one of the core advantages of the small satellites segment, thus allowing for significant cost reduction throughout their development and production cycles. At the same time, big data analysis and the artificial intelligence (AI) industries are booming. Periodically full coverage data from small satellites provides a data source for data mining and periodic statistics for a wide range of targets. It provides huge opportunities and extension channels for the applications of big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in Earth observation (EO). The present paper describes research on the technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO.

Therefore, a more objective means of quantifying livability is needed. The service industry has demonstrated the intersection of machine learning classifiers and survey domain knowledge for evaluating users' quality of experiences; however, this process of inquiry-based learning has never been considered for solving the communication difficulties between community stakeholders and transportation agencies.

Techniques deployed include supervised machine learning methods, statistical spatial tests, and simple calculations of the area size and frequency of objects. \u00a9 2018 CEUR-WS.

Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the development of a new dynamic-based power market design. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"Computational modeling; Geographic information systems; Machine learning-based data analysis","Authors":"Rai A., Jagadeesh Kannan R.","DOI":"10.22159\/ajpcr.2017.v10s1.19744","x":3.9300000668,"y":3.5299999714},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":579,"Cited by":null,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"The syntactic signature of starbucks' locations Towards a machine-learning approach to location decision-making","Abstract":"The space syntax Theory of Natural Movement postulates that everything else being equal, land use selects their location based on the asymmetry of accessibility created by the configuration of the street network. In this article, I test the hypothesis whether configurational (syntactic) properties of an urban street network are relevant for the location of land use. If syntactic features are relevant, then land use types may have a 'syntactic signature'. To identify this blueprint, I apply machine-learning techniques to datasets of syntactic measures, for ten business types. The results are ten models, each with the syntactic blueprint of a type of business. The models are used to predict the existence, or not, of such businesses in segments of the map of London. The performance of the models varies, with fifty per cent reaching statistical significance, including one with 'good' prediction ability. The models for Starbucks coffee shops and solicitor's offices have the strongest prediction ability. The exploratory exercise demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning method Random Forests, when supervised and individually applied to a business activity, to identify the syntactic signature of business types. Such models can be used during planning and design and on location studies. The results strengthen the candidacy of syntactic measurements to location-decision-making. Moreover, they reinforce the theory of Natural Movement.","Author Keywords":"Land use; Machine-learning; Random forest; Space syntax; Spatial configuration; Urban planning.","Authors":"Silva J.P.","DOI":null,"x":4.8099999428,"y":4.1599998474},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":-1,"DocId":588,"Cited by":null,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Study on traditional architectural features of JIN-ai under the influence of silk road commerce","Abstract":"The Silk Road is the green commercial thoroughfare between Europe and Asia, and also a cultural front for confrontations as well as coordination between the western and eastern civilizations. The ancient business towns along the Silk Road are like stars shining in the great universe. Yuzhong County of Lanzhou City is a market town. Since Han, it began to undertake commercial supplies, cargo transit, postal transfer and many other important roles in history. Rich in cultural heritage, Jin-ai has formed its traditional architecture and its culture of distinct regional characteristics. This article is based on field research and concerned with how Jin-ai's traditional buildings, adapting farming, commerce, patriarchal relations, reflect its morphology, external space, layout and spatial scales, as well as its traditional cultural characteristics. \u00a9 (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Author Keywords":"Architectural features; Jin-ai; Silk road; Traditional architectural","Authors":"Ye M., Zhang H., Zhang S.","DOI":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/AMR.671-674.2328","x":5.7100000381,"y":3.7899999619},{"HDBSCAN_Cluster":2,"DocId":589,"Cited by":null,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Online cooperative design for the proposal of layouts of street furniture in a street park","Abstract":"In the last decade of the twenty-first century, the rapid development of Internet and computer technology has enabled conduct cooperative design through the Internet. Al-Douri (2010) argued that conventional urban planning may lack adequate coverage of the essential design aspects of the built environment, which can be corrected by digital models and information technology tools that may help designers to visualize and interact with design alternatives and correct this problem. Following the work of Carmona and Punter (2002), Ai-Douri classified urban design aspects, such as urban form, townscape, public realm, conservation areas, land use, and landscape architecture. Under the multi-user architecture for team environments, the technical conditions for the implementation of cooperative design comprises both a visual representation and a semantic representation, as well as a shared workspace for shared understanding (Saad and Maher 1996). Meanwhile, research on online design tools has recently appeared in literature regarding coordination, collaboration, and communication in cooperative design (Klein 1995; Nurcan 1998; Okukuni et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2009) using virtual reality (VR). It is worthwhile to explore the prospect of online cooperative design as an application and extension of VR technology. In this chapter, we focus on a shared visual representation and computer-mediated communication (Miller and Brunner 2008) between participants for reaching a consensus on the design of a street park. \u00a9 2012, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Author Keywords":"ASP3; Doyle; Expense","Authors":"Shen Z., Zhou D., Kawakami M., Kishimoto K., Imai S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-642-13559-0_10","x":6.2600002289,"y":3.4800000191}]
