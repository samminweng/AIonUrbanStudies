[{"DocId":5,"Cited by":126.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Partial least-squares regression for linking land-cover patterns to soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds","Abstract":"There are strong ties between land cover patterns and soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds. The spatial configuration of land cover has recently become an important aspect of the study of geomorphological processes related to erosion within watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of soil erosion and sediment yield to land cover patterns in watersheds. However, many landscape metrics are highly correlated and may result in redundancy, which violates the assumptions of a traditional least-squares approach, thus leading to singular solutions or otherwise biased parameter estimates and confidence intervals. Here, we investigated the landscape patterns within watersheds in the Upper Du River watershed (8973km2) in China and examined how the spatial patterns of land cover are related to the soil erosion and sediment yield of watersheds using hydrological modeling and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The results indicate that the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield are closely associated with the land cover patterns. At the landscape level, landscape characteristics, such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), contagion (CONTAG), and patch cohesion index (COHESION), were identified as the primary metrics controlling the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield. The landscape characteristics in watersheds could account for as much as 65% and 74% of the variation in soil erosion and sediment yield, respectively. Greater interspersion and an increased number of patch land cover types may significantly accelerate soilerosion and increase sediment export. PLSR can be used to simply determine the relationships between land-cover patterns and watershed soil erosion and sediment yield, providing quantitative information to allow decision makers to make better choices regarding landscape planning. With readily available remote sensing data and rapid developments in geographic information system (GIS) technology, this practical and simple PLSR approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Co-dependent data; Landscape metrics; Sediment delivery ratio; Sediment yield; Soil erosion","Authors":"Shi Z.H., Ai L., Li X., Huang X.D., Wu G.L., Liao W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2013.06.031","Text":"Partial least-squares regression for linking land-cover patterns to soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds.

and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Data-mining; FANP; Flood risk management; GIS; Urban planning","Authors":"Darabi H., Choubin B., Rahmati O., Torabi Haghighi A., Pradhan B., Kl\u00f8ve B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2018.12.002","Text":"Urban flood risk mapping using the GARP and QUEST models: A comparative study of machine learning techniques.

energy disclosure (or benchmarking) laws to encourage transparency in energy efficiency markets and to support sustainability and carbon reduction plans. In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1\u00a0million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf and for residential buildings is 31.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings \u2013 those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall \u2013 are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Building energy; Energy efficiency; Energy prediction; Machine learning; Urban dynamics","Authors":"Kontokosta C.E., Tull C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apenergy.2017.04.005","Text":"A data-driven predictive model of city-scale energy use in buildings.

automata (CA) have been increasingly used in simulating urban expansion and land-use dynamics. However, most urban CA models rely on empirical data for deriving transition rules, assuming that the historical trend will continue into the future. Such inertia CA models do not take into account possible external interventions, particularly planning policies, and thus have rarely been used in urban and land-use planning. This paper proposes to use artificial immune systems (AIS) as a technique for incorporating external interventions and generating alternatives in urban simulation. Inspired by biological immune systems, the primary process of AIS is the evolution of a set of 'antibodies' that are capable of learning through interactions with a set of sample 'antigens'. These 'antibodies' finally get 'matured' and can be used to identify\/classify other 'antigens'. An AIS-based CA model incorporates planning policies by altering the evolution mechanism of the 'antibodies'. Such a model is capable of generating different scenarios of urban development under different land-use policies, with which the planners will be able to answer 'what if' questions and to evaluate different options. We applied an AIS-based CA model to the simulation of urban agglomeration development in the Pearl River Delta in southern China. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can be very useful in exploring various planning scenarios of urban development. \u00a9 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"Artificial immune system; Cellular automata; Urban planning; Urban simulation","Authors":"Liu X., Li X., Shi X., Zhang X., Chen Y.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658810903270551","Text":"Simulating land-use dynamics under planning policies by integrating artificial immune systems with cellular automata.

characteristics of landscape pattern change can reflect the spatial impact of urbanization on the ecological environment. Studying the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns can provide supports for urban ecological management. Previous studies have examined the quantitative relationship between the social economy and landscape patterns of an entire region, but have not considered the spatial non-stability of this relationship. In this study, we characterized the landscape patterns in Beijing City, China during 2000 and 2010 using four landscape metrics, i.e. patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the aggregation index (AI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity and evolution characteristics of the relationship between the urbanization of population density (POP), gross domestic production (GDP) and nighttime lighting (NTL), and landscape patterns. The evolution of urban landscape patterns indicated a decentralized, aggregated, and fragmented change from the downtown to the suburb and outer suburb. During the 10-year period, the average PD in the downtown increased by 100.6%, and the increase of AI in the suburb was the largest. The PD, ED and SHDI increased by different degrees in the outer suburb. The influences of different urbanization modes on landscape patterns were also different. Infilling mode made the landscape patterns more regular and integrated. The landscape was more broken and complicated under the edge-expanding mode, and the leapfrog mode made PD and SHDI increase slightly. In the relationship interpretation, GWR effectively identified the spatial heterogeneity, and improved the explanatory ability compared to ordinary least squares (OLS). The most intense response to urbanization was the forest landscape and the forest-cultivated land ecotone in the northwest of Beijing City, indicating that this region was ecologically fragile. The population density in the urbanization index had a direct effect on landscape patterns, while the PD affected by urbanization was greater than the shape, aggregation and diversity index. Affected by development policy, urban planning and other factors, the explanation degree of social economy to landscape patterns decreased in 2010. GWR is an effective method for quantifying the spatial differentiation characteristics of urbanization impacts on landscape patterns, which can provide more spatial information and decision criteria for the green development of a compact city. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Compact green city Beijing City, China; GWR; Landscape metrics;Urbanization mode","Authors":"Huilei L., Jian P., Yanxu L., Yi'na H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ecolind.2017.06.032","Text":"Urbanization impact on landscape patterns in Beijing City, China: A spatial heterogeneity perspective.

integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework","Abstract":"Cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used by researchers over the last three decades to simulate land-use change (LUC). While conventional CA and ANN models assign a cell to only one land-use class, in reality, a cell may belong to several land-use classes simultaneously. The recently developed multi-label (ML) concept overcomes this limitation in land change science. Although the ML concept is a new paradigm with nonexclusive classes and has shown considerable merit in several applications, few studies in land change science have applied it. In addition, determining transition rules in conventional CA is difficult when the number of drivers is large. Since CA has been shown as a potential model to consider neighborhood effects and ANN has been shown effective in determining CA transition rules, we integrated both CA with an ANN model to overcome limitations of each tool. In this study, we specifically extended the ANN-based Land Transformation Model (LTM) with both a CA-based model and the ML concept to create an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework. We also compared, using standard evaluation measures, differences between the proposed integrated model with a conventional CA-based LTM model (called the ml-CA-LTM). Parameterization was made using a learning and testing procedure common in machine learning. Results showed that the modified LUC model, ML-CA-LTM, produced consistently better goodness of fit calibration values compared to the ml-CA-LTM. The outcome of this modified model can be used by managers and decision makers for improved urban planning. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"arti\ufb01cial neural networks; cellular automata; land-use change; mono-label class; multi-label classes","Authors":"Omrani H., Tayyebi A., Pijanowski B.","DOI":"10.1080\/15481603.2016.1265706","Text":"Integrating the multi-label land-use concept and cellular automata with the artificial neural network-based Land Transformation Model: an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework.

water is a significant resource for socio-economic growth and the protection of healthy environments. Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies.

scale","Abstract":"Guiding urban planners on the cooling returns of different configurations of urban vegetation is important to protect urban dwellers from adverse heat impacts. To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km 2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales. \u00a9 2018","Author Keywords":"Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Land surface temperature (LST); Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban vegetation","Authors":"Duncan J.M.A., Boruff B., Saunders A., Sun Q., Hurley J., Amati M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2018.11.223","Text":"Turning down the heat: An enhanced understanding of the relationship between urban vegetation and surface temperature at the city scale.

as increasing the inner-city temperature compared with that of the surrounding suburbs. The UHI effect is a leading cause of heat-related diseases and mortality in many nations. However, there are still two main shortcomings. First, the effect of UHI is not well recognized in arid and semi-arid regions. Second, the association of multi-dimensional information with surface temperature in urban areas must be examined. This study focuses on the height-related aspects of urban geometry in an arid region. A range of multispectral and spatial vector data were used to derive the surface temperature and two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) information of the study area. All information was aggregated into a grid with common spatial resolution to create a homogeneous dataset. The machine learning statistical model of a boosted regression tree (BRT) was used to reflect the relative influence of 2D and 3D indicators with land surface temperature. Our results showed a cooler surface temperature in the city than in the surrounding area, leading to the question of whether the established UHI definition encompasses all types of cities. In addition, the thermal band was able to distinguish different spatial structures in the study area. The BRT analysis demonstrated that both multi-dimensional 2D and 3D indicators affect the surface temperature. In particular, the 3D indicators play a more important role than 2D indicators in shaping the surface temperature at different urban geometries of the study area. This new method can help urban planners identify the most influential 2D and 3D indicators that affect the surface temperature in different districts of a city. \u00a9 2017","Author Keywords":"3D modeling; Boosted regression tree analysis; Building shadows; Urban ecology; Urban heat island; Urban morphology","Authors":"Alavipanah S., Schreyer J., Haase D., Lakes T., Qureshi S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jclepro.2017.12.187","Text":"The effect of multi-dimensional indicators on urban thermal conditions.

and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas. Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people\u05f3s reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard. In addition, this forecasting approach can provide decision support for smog-related health hazard management through functions like early warning. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Data mining; Forecasting; Health hazard; Smog disaster; Social media; Urban data","Authors":"Chen J., Chen H., Wu Z., Hu D., Pan J.Z.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.is.2016.03.011","Text":"Forecasting smog-related health hazard based on social media and physical sensor.

gradually accelerated urbanization process, simulating and predicting the future pattern of the city is of great importance to the prediction and prevention of some environmental, economic and urban issues. Previous studies have generally integrated traditional machine learning with cellular automaton (CA) models to simulate urban development. Nevertheless, difficulties still exist in the process of obtaining more accurate results with CA models; such difficulties are mainly due to the insufficient consideration of neighborhood effects during urban transition rule mining. In this paper, we used an effective deep learning method, named convolution neural network for united mining (UMCNN), to solve the problem. UMCNN has substantial potential to get neighborhood information from its receptive field. Thus, a novel CA model coupled with UMCNN and Markov chain was designed to improve the performance of simulating urban expansion processes. Choosing the Pearl River Delta of China as the study area, we excavate the driving factors and the transformational relations revealed by the urban land-use patterns in 2000, 2005 and 2010 and further simulate the urban expansion status in 2020 and 2030. Additionally, three traditional machine-learning-based CA models (LR, ANN and RFA) are built to attest the practicality of the proposed model. In the comparison, the proposed method reaches the highest simulation accuracy and landscape index similarity. The predicted urban expansion results reveal that the economy will continue to be the primary factor in the study area from 2010 to 2030. The proposed model can serve as guidance in urban planning and government decision-making. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"cellular automata; deep learning; large scale; Markov chain; Urban expansion","Authors":"He J., Li X., Yao Y., Hong Y., Jinbao Z.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2018.1480783","Text":"Mining transition rules of cellular automata for simulating urban expansion by using the deep learning techniques.

have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and \"interpretability\". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of \"regional centers\" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Amenities; Land use; Public transit; Urban planning","Authors":"Hu N., Legara E.F., Lee K.K., Hung G.G., Monterola C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2016.06.004","Text":"Impacts of land use and amenities on public transport use, urban planning and design.

appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines","Authors":"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108","Text":"A tool for urban soundscape evaluation applying Support Vector Machines for developing a soundscape classification model.

environment features are associated with travel-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions is essential for planners to encourage environmentally sustainable travel through transportation and land use policies. Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range.

simulations and predictions of urban expansion are critical to manage urbanization and explicitly address the spatiotemporal trends and distributions of urban expansion. Cellular Automata integrated Markov Chain (CA-MC) is one of the most frequently used models for this purpose. However, the urban suitability index (USI) map produced from the conventional CA-MC is either affected by human bias or cannot accurately reflect the possible nonlinear relations between driving factors and urban expansion. To overcome these limitations, a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network, ANN) was integrated with CA-MC instead of the commonly used Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Logistic Regression (LR) CA-MC models. The ANN was optimized to create the USI map and then integrated with CA-MC to spatially allocate urban expansion cells. The validated results of kappa and fuzzy kappa simulation indicate that ANN-CA-MC outperformed other variously coupled CA-MC modelling approaches. Based on the ANN-CA-MC model, the urban area in South Auckland is predicted to expand to 1340.55\u00a0ha in 2026 at the expense of non-urban areas, mostly grassland and open-bare land.

Apart from signal processing, four machine learning techniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and clustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between the participants\u2019 physiological responses and environmental conditions.

environment","Abstract":"The increased availability and improved quality of new sensing technologies have catalyzed a growing body of research to evaluate and leverage these tools in order to quantify and describe urban environments. Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R2 = 0.36\u20130.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R2 = 0.68\u20130.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Air quality; Calibration; Low-cost sensing; Machine learning; Urban","Authors":"Johnson N.E., Bonczak B., Kontokosta C.E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2018.04.019","Text":"Using a gradient boosting model to improve the performance of low-cost aerosol monitors in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment.

This study presents a methodology for identifying low-carbon travel block, which can be used to identify the built environment conducive to residents\u2019 low-carbon travel. We chose the four elements of traffic survey\u2014travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency\u2014as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from \u201cWeChat,\u201d a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects\u2014land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types\u2019 building area should be \u201c4:1\u20133:1\u201d; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350\u2013450\u00a0m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15\u201320%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150\u00a0m is 40\u201350%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50\u00a0m is 45\u201360%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100\u00a0m is 50\u201370%.

Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system.

indoor and outdoor environment in which to live, there is a need to understand turbulent air flows within the urban environment. To this end, building on a previously reported method [1], we develop a fast-running Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Model (NIROM) for predicting the turbulent air flows found within an urban environment. To resolve larger scale turbulent fluctuations, we employ a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and solve the resulting computational model on unstructured meshes. The objective is to construct a rapid-running NIROM from these results that will have \u2018similar\u2019 dynamics to the original LES model. Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and machine learning techniques, this Reduced Order Model (ROM) is six orders of magnitude faster than the high-fidelity LES model and we demonstrate how \u2018similar\u2019 it can be to the high-fidelity model by comparing statistical quantities such as the mean flows, Reynolds stresses and probability densities of the velocities. We also include validation of the high-fidelity model against data from wind tunnel experiments. This paper represents a key step towards the use of reduced order modelling for operational purposes with the tantalising possibility of it being used in place of Gaussian plume models, and the potential for greatly improved model fidelity and confidence. \u00a9 2018","Author Keywords":"Gaussian process regression; Machine learning; Non-intrusive reduced order modelling; Operational modelling; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Urban flows","Authors":"Xiao D., Heaney C.E., Mottet L., Fang F., Lin W., Navon I.M., Guo Y., Matar O.K., Robins A.G., Pain C.C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2018.10.035","Text":"A reduced order model for turbulent flows in the urban environment using machine learning.

is widely acknowledged that urban form significantly affects urban thermal environment, which is a key element to adapt and mitigate extreme high temperature weather in high-density urban areas. However, few studies have discussed the impact of physical urban form features on the land surface temperature (LST) from a perspective of comprehensive urban spatial structures. This study used the ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and random forest regression (RF) to distinguish the relative contributions of urban form metrics on LST at three observation scales. Results of this study indicate that more than 90% of the LST variations were explained by selected urban form metrics using RF. Effects of the magnitude and direction of urban form metrics on LST varied with the changes of seasons and observation scales. Overall, building morphology and urban ecological infrastructure had dominant effects on LST variations in high-density urban centers. Urban green space and water bodies demonstrated stronger cooling effects, especially in summer. Building density (BD) exhibited significant positive effects on LST, whereas the floor area ratio (FAR) showed a negative influence on LST. The results can be applied to investigate and implement urban thermal environment mitigation planning for city managers and planners. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Land surface temperature; Ordinary least-squares regression; Random forest regression; Urban form","Authors":"Sun Y., Gao C., Li J., Wang R., Liu J.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11080924","Text":"Quantifying the effects of urban form on land surface temperature in subtropical high-density urban areas using machine learning.

effects","Abstract":"Urban architecture is an important contributor to urban heat island (UHI) effects. Yet thorough investigations into how three-dimensional (3D) architectural patterns influence urban thermal conditions collectively and individually are limited. This study bridges this gap by adopting a machine learning method, boosted regression tree (BRT), to analyze the relative influences and marginal effects of 3D urban architecture on land surface temperature (LST). Ten architectural metrics are incorporated to describe the composition and configuration of 3D architectural patterns at a neighborhood scale in the typical megacity of Shanghai. The results show that in summer, the building coverage ratio (BCR), mean architecture height (MAH), mean architecture height standard deviation (AHSD) and mean architecture projection area (MAPA) are the most influential factors, with relative contributions of 39.3%, 16.5%, 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively. The regulation amplitudes (\u0394T) of the dominant metrics for the neighborhood average LST temperature are 2.7 \u00b0C, 0.9 \u00b0C, 0.6 \u00b0C, and 0.6 \u00b0C, respectively. Moreover, with the LST, the BCR exhibits a monotonic positive correlation, the MAH and AHSD show a stepwise negative correlation, and the MAPA shows a combination of positive and negative correlation. It is generally recommended to decrease the development intensity and architectural base area, while increase the building height and roughness to improve the urban thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale. The dominant contributors and related marginal effects are generally consistent across different seasons. These findings can provide quantitative insights for mitigating the LST effects via rational design and management of 3D architectural patterns. Given the distinctive insights provided, the BRT method is recommended for disentangling the relationship between LST and environmental variables in upcoming studies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"3D architectural pattern; Boosted regression tree (BRT); Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI)","Authors":"Sun F., Liu M., Wang Y., Wang H., Che Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jclepro.2020.120706","Text":"The effects of 3D architectural patterns on the urban surface temperature at a neighborhood scale: Relative contributions and marginal effects.

City","Abstract":"Cities are centers of political, economic, cultural and social life. It is a symbol of human civilization and development, and urbanization is a common trend in many countries. Nowadays, world urbanization accelerates greatly, especially in developing countries. While providing great economic and social benefits, urbanization has also created some environmental problems, including the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI has deep impacts on material cycles and energy transfers within urban ecosystems, and has become an important issue in urban climate and environmental research. Xiamen is one of the special economic zones, and its rapid urbanization induced the UHI becoming much more intense and extensive. To study UHI from a viewpoint of landscape is a new method in urban thermal environment research. Analyzing the dynamics of the urban thermal landscape in the context of urbanization will provide support for environmental protection, energy use policy making, and urban planning and management. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of urban thermal landscape pattern in the main area of Xiamen City. Firstly, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal images, which were acquired on similar dates in the winter of 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007, were used to retrieve brightness temperature. Then a relative brightness temperature (R) was calculated and the thermal patches were classified into 6 grades by temperature difference. Landscape metrics were used here at both landscape and class level to quantify changes in the urban thermal landscape pattern. And they can describe the changes of thermal landscape pattern in 3 aspects, including quantity, shape and structure. Finally, we investigated the distribution of thermal pollution sources in Xiamen. The results showed that: 1) In terms of quantity, with the rapid urbanization of Xiamen City between 1987 and 2007, the thermal landscape became more fragmented, and was more and more dominated by high-grade thermal landscape patches. 2) The shape of high-grade thermal patches even the whole landscape tends to complex. 3) For structure, each grade of thermal landscape became well-distributed and even. The new high-grade thermal patches were found close to the old ones that induced the proximity index (PROX_MN) of high-grade thermal patches increased; the aggregation index (AI) of the whole landscape decreased while the high-grade thermal patches increased; the contagion index (CONTAG) of the whole landscape also decreased so that dominance of high-grade thermal patches gradually increased. 4) The area of thermal patches which converted from low-grade to high-grade is bigger than the area converted from high-grade to low- grade. According to statistical analysis, we found that it is much easier that the high-grade thermal landscape patches converted into the middle-grade thermal landscape than converted among high grades. 5) The high-grade thermal patches mainly distributed in the industry area, and they were increased remarkably. All the high-grade thermal patches experienced three kinds of changes (increasing number, expanding area and increasing grade), and grouped into five high temperature zones (Haicang, Xinyang, Xinglin, seaport of Xiamen island and airport), especially in the industrial districts of Xinyang and Xinglin.","Author Keywords":"Landscape pattern; Urban heat island; Urbanisation; Xiamen City","Authors":"Huang J., Zhao X., Tang L., Qiu Q.","DOI":"10.5846\/stxb201012071745","Text":"Analysis on spatiotemporal changes of urban thermal landscape pattern in the context of urbanisation: A case study of Xiamen City.

cellular automata (VCA) models have been applied in land use change simulations at fine scales. However, the neighborhood effects of the driving factors are rarely considered in the exploration of the transition suitability of cells, leading to lower simulation accuracy. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-VCA model that adopts the CNN to extract the high-level features of the driving factors within a neighborhood of an irregularly shaped cell and discover the relationships between multiple land use changes and driving factors at the neighborhood level. The proposed model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China. Compared with several VCA models using other machine learning methods, the proposed CNN-VCA model obtained the highest simulation accuracy (figure-of-merit\u00a0=\u00a00.361). The results indicated that the CNN-VCA model can effectively uncover the neighborhood effects of multiple driving factors on the developmental potential of land parcels and obtain more details on the morphological characteristics of land parcels. Moreover, the land use patterns of 2020 and 2025 under an ecological control strategy were simulated to provide decision support for urban planning. \u00a9 2020, \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"cellular automata; convolutional neural network; fine scale; Land use change; urban planning","Authors":"Zhai Y., Yao Y., Guan Q., Liang X., Li X., Pan Y., Yue H., Yuan Z., Zhou J.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2020.1711915","Text":"Simulating urban land use change by integrating a convolutional neural network with vector-based cellular automata.

approach","Abstract":"Climate change has increased the likelihood of the occurrence of disasters like wildfires, floods, storms, and landslides worldwide in the last years. Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Landslide; Machine learning; Naples municipality; Remote sensing; Susceptibility mapping; Wildfire","Authors":"Di Napoli M., Marsiglia P., Di Martire D., Ramondini M., Ullo S.L., Calcaterra D.","DOI":"10.3390\/RS12152505","Text":"Landslide susceptibility assessment of wildfire burnt areas through earth-observation techniques and a machine learning-based approach.

maximum coverage location problem models","Abstract":"The increases in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events due to global climate change and the development of additional pavement, roads and water storage sites due to population growth have enhanced the probability of pluvial flooding (PF) in urban areas. The estimation of urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However, uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the nearest ERC. \u00a9 2019","Author Keywords":"Emergency response point; GIS; Maximum coverage location problem; Pluvial flooding","Authors":"Rizeei H.M., Pradhan B., Saharkhiz M.A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ijdrr.2019.101205","Text":"Allocation of emergency response centres in response to pluvial flooding-prone demand points using integrated multiple layer perceptron and maximum coverage location problem models.

source of information for deciding where to go and what to do. Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level. This opens up new opportunities for data-driven approaches to urban leisure and tourism studies. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"City planning; Knowledge extraction; Latent semantics; Multi-label classification; Place affordance; Urban space","Authors":"van Weerdenburg D., Scheider S., Adams B., Spierings B., van der Zee E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2018.09.005","Text":"Where to go and what to do: Extracting leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space.

China)","Abstract":"To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR) model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters; especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

opened to the public. Tools for exploitation, analysis and discovery of new knowledge in large data sets are the key to enable citizens to make sense of such large amount of data. The purpose of this work is to analyze how data analysis associated with visualization techniques in different levels can lead to the improvement of the interpretability of open data. With the support of machine learning techniques, these visualizations may improve pattern identification in urban data sets. To guide our discussion, a case study was conducted analyzing socioeconomic data released by the Chicago city government. We discussed the use of different visualizations in this scenario, tailored for univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. We also performed an evaluation of the different forms of visualization proposed in this work. We could observe that allowing the user to explore open urban data using some specific visualizations may lead to more effective data interpretation. \u00a9 2017 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Cluster analysis; Data visualization; Open government data; Sensemaking","Authors":"Barcellos R., Viterbo J., Miranda L., Bernardini F., Maciel C., Trevisan D.","DOI":"10.1145\/3085228.3085294","Text":"Transparency in practice: Using visualization to enhance the interpretability of open data.

important role in the processes of formation, generation and change of urban identity. Under present day conditions, the identities of cities are rapidly deteriorating and vanishing. Therefore, the importance of urban design, which is a means of designing urban spaces and their physical and social aspects, is ever growing. This paper proposes a novel methodology by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering approach to find important features of the urban identity from public space. K. Lynch's work and Space Syntax theory are reconstructed and integrated with POI (Points of Interest) to quantify the quality of the public space. A case study of Z\u00fcrich city is used to test of these redefinitions and features of urban identity. The results show that PCA and K-means clustering approach can identify the urban identity and explore important features. This strategy could help to improve planning and design processes and generation of new urban patterns with more appropriate features and qualities. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Feature extraction; K-means clustering; Space syntax; Urban identity","Authors":"Chang M.-C., Bus P., Schmitt G.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2017.00015","Text":"Feature extraction and k-means clustering approach to explore important features of urban identity.

investigate whether or not a computer may predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, based on acoustic data only.

Moreover, if the computer was able to make an accurate prediction, we also wanted to know what information it needed to make this prediction. We recruited 33 students (18 female; Mage = 25.4 yrs., SDage = 3.6) out of which 30 assessed how pleasant and eventful 102 unique soundscape excerpts (30 s) from Stockholm were. Based on the Bag of Frames approach, a Support Vector Regression learning algorithm was used to identify relationships between various acoustic features of the acoustics signals and perceived affective quality. We found that the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients provided strong predictions for both Pleasantness (R2 = 0.74) and Eventfulness (R2 = 0.83). This model performed better than the average individual in the experiment in terms of internal consistency of individual assessments.

a data poor environment. Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment.

More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009).

In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape.

energy","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System is a limited-area working model with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km for estimating local-scale weather forecasts on the Korean peninsula.

The spatial information was processed using statistical methods, such as linear regression models and machine learning. By comparing the accuracy of the estimated air temperatures with observational data during the summer, the machine learning was improved. In addition, horizontal and vertical characteristics of the urban space were better represented, and the air temperature was better resolved spatially.

is a threatening natural hazard in urban areas all over the world, especially in recent years given its increasing frequency of occurrence. In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events \u2013 especially in the future climate \u2013 this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning. \u00a9 2020 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Rainfall threshold; Shenzhen city; Urban pluvial flooding","Authors":"Ke Q., Tian X., Bricker J., Tian Z., Guan G., Cai H., Huang X., Yang H., Liu J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.advwatres.2020.103719","Text":"Urban pluvial flooding prediction by machine learning approaches \u2013 a case study of Shenzhen city, China.

a few of many puzzling factors affecting our future cities. Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions. This will play a vital role in sustaining Jordan's food security. \u00a9 2020Environmental science, Computer science, Geography, Land use planning, Land use change, Urban growth, Machine learning, Urban planning, Modeling; Artificial intelligence, Cellular Automata, Markov Chain. \u00a9 2020","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Cellular Automata; Computer science; Environmental science; Geography; Land use change; Land use planning; Machine learning; Markov Chain; Modeling; Urban growth; Urban planning","Authors":"Gharaibeh A., Shaamala A., Obeidat R., Al-Kofahi S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.heliyon.2020.e05092","Text":"Improving land-use change modeling by integrating ANN with Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model.

annual land use change is crucial to timely assessment of the impacts of land use policies, especially in rapidly urbanizing areas such as the Liangjiang New District of Chongqing, China. This research aims to assess the impacts of multi-level land use policies and plans and their effectiveness in protecting farmland, and to recommend policies to remedy defective ones. Markov Chain\u2013Cellular Automata modelling was integrated with machine learning to predict future urbanization. The results show that prior to the establishment of the District in late 2010, the urban area grew at 13% annually because local policies promoted profit-motivated development. This rate declined drastically to 4% during 2011\u20132012 in direct response to the changed local land use policies and strict enforcement of national policies. These policies stabilized the urbanization rate at 7% over the subsequent years. The safeguard of previous farmland was possible only when the national policies were aligned closely with the local policies in their aim, provided both were rigorously enforced through a land management agency. Urban land in 2020 is predicted to growth by at least 464 km2 with some differences between two scenarios. In the baseline scenario (no change in policies), almost 70% of new growth will take place inside three industry zones and the duty-free ports. However, in the national overall plan scenario, a significant amount of marginal farmland will be changed into greenfields within the planned urban zones. It is recommended that a hierarchical farmland protection policy be implemented. It should incorporate the national policies that must be adapted to the local settings to achieve sustainable urbanization and to minimize farmland loss. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural network; Land use change; Land use policies and plans; Markov Chain \u2013 Cellular Automata (MC-CA); Rapid urbanization; Spatiotemporal analysis","Authors":"Xu T., Gao J., Li Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2019.104030","Text":"Machine learning-assisted evaluation of land use policies and plans in a rapidly urbanizing district in Chongqing, China.

technologies and the Internet of Things gives us the opportunity to carry out large-scale social studies and to collect vast amounts of data from our cities. In this paper, we investigate a novel way of analyzing data from social sciences studies by employing machine learning and data science techniques. This enables us to maximize the insight gained from this type of studies by fusing both objective (sensor information) and subjective data (direct input from the users). The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas. This paper allows us to gain an overview of certain patterns and the behavior of the citizens within their surroundings and it proves the capabilities of integrating technology into large-scale social studies. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Data analysis; data science; smart cities; social science; urban analytics; urban planning","Authors":"Erhan L., Ndubuaku M., Ferrara E., Richardson M., Sheffield D., Ferguson F.J., Brindley P., Liotta A.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2897217","Text":"Analyzing Objective and Subjective Data in Social Sciences: Implications for Smart Cities.

arid and semi-arid regions like Iran, which face serious water tensions. Since studying aridity and its trend of changes has a significant role in water resources management and urban planning, this research has investigated spatial and temporal changes and trend of aridity changes in Iran as an arid country. To study the issue, 51 weather stations of Iran which covered a 30-year statistical period (1981\u20132010) were selected. Climatic variables, namely precipitation, vapor pressure, local pressure, temperature, maximum temperature, and relative humidity and required data to calculate the potential evapotranspiration were extracted from Iran meteorology organization data. In next step by applying Ai, Im, and Iq aridity indices, zoning of the aridity was done after studying the aridity traits and its change. Then the most compatible aridity index was introduced according to the values of correlation between climatic factors of aridity indices and the magnitude of each main climatic area of Iran. Furthermore, in order to recognize aridity changes in Iran during the selected 30-year period, Mann-Kendal nonparametric test was used. Correlation analysis results showed that 35.4 and 64.6\u00a0% of Iran arid areas show more compatibility with Im and Ai, respectively, which means that these indices are more appropriate to study aridity in arid regions of Iran. Also, it was revealed that 5.6 and 94.3\u00a0% of Caspian south plain region has more compatibility with Ai and Iq indices, respectively. As a matter of fact, 77.8, 0.75, and 21.4\u00a0% of the country area can be studied better by Ai, Iq, and Im, respectively. Also, the results of Mann-Kendal nonparametric test confirmed that aridity is developing in Iran. In other words, 80.4\u00a0% of Iran area had increasing trend of aridity during the selected period and in just 19.6\u00a0% of the area, aridity trend was not significant or decreasing. \u00a9 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Author Keywords":"Aridity; Aridity index; Iran; Trend of aridity changes; Zoning","Authors":"Zolfaghari H., Masoompour J., Yeganefar M., Akbary M.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12517-016-2379-9","Text":"Studying spatial and temporal changes of aridity in Iran.

approaches","Abstract":"Rainfall-induced shallow landslides represent a serious threat in hilly and mountain areas around the world. The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the \u201creach angle\u201d method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, this study developed a machine learning-based method to compare the distributions of building heights in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two cities with different development patterns. First, we collected detailed information on the buildings, such as the location and land values. Second, the height of each building was simulated based on the above information using the well-known random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and artificial neural network. The random forests algorithm outperformed the other two in both cities. We also found that the commercial land value is the most important factor associated with building heights.

In this study, a set of commonly used urban functional zones classification approaches, including Multinomial Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, are examined and compared with the newly developed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, using the case study of Yuzhong District, Chongqing, China. The investigation is based on multi-variate geospatial data, including night-time imagery, geotagged Weibo data, points of interest (POI) from Gaode, and Baidu Heat Map. This study is the first endeavor of implementing the XGBoost model in the field of urban functional zones classification. The results suggest that the XGBoost classification model performed the best and was able to achieve an accuracy of 88.05%, which is significantly higher than the other commonly used approaches.

about urban built-up areas is important for urban planning and management. However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification (BAIC) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the BAIC were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the BAIC to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest (POI), Road Network (RN), nighttime light (NTL), a combination of POI and RN data (POI_RN), a combination of POI and NTL data (POI_NTL), a combination of RN and NTL data (RN_NTL), and a combination of POI, RN, and NTL data (POI_RN_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and AdaBoost. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 76 to 89%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. The largest F1 value and OA were obtained using the POI_RN_NTL data and AdaBoost, while the largest AUC was obtained using POI_RN_NTL and POI_NTL data against AdaBoost, LR, and RF; and (2) the advantages of the BAIC include its support for multi-source input data, its objective accuracy assessment, and its robust classifiers. The BAIC can quickly and efficiently realize the automatic classification of urban built-up areas at a reasonably low cost and can be readily applied to other urban areas in the world where any kind of POI, RN, or NTL data coverage is available. The results of this study are expected to provide timely and effective reference information for urban planning and urban management departments, and could also potentially be used to develop large-scale maps of urban built-up areas in the future. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; NTL; POI; Road network; Urban built-up area","Authors":"Sun L., Tang L., Shao G., Qiu Q., Lan T., Shao J.","DOI":"10.3390\/RS12010091","Text":"A machine learning-based classification system for urban built-up areas using multiple classifiers and data sources.

pedestrian-friendly, sustainable cities. Currently, urban planners are hindered by a lack of information available in a format suitable for the large-scale analysis of sidewalk design. To demonstrate the impact that information technology could have in this area, we leverage techniques from machine learning and computer vision to gather information about the presence and quality of sidewalks in map images. In particular, we identify sidewalk segments in street view images using a random forest classifier, utilizing a set of local and global features that include geometric context, presence of lanes, pixel color, and location. Our results illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segments in a large set of street view images. This algorithm can be easily extended to other datasets, and can be automated to gather complete, fine-grained details about sidewalks for arbitrarily large urban environments. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Smith V., Malik J., Culler D.","DOI":"10.1109\/IGCC.2013.6604476","Text":"Classification of sidewalks in street view images.

gaze dynamics of pedestrians can increase our understanding of how important architectural features in urban environments are perceived by pedestrians. The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences. We briefly describe how the obtained multidimensional trajectory data can be analysed by using a temporal behaviour analysis technique based on support vector machines that was developed separately. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"gaze analysis; localization; manifold learning; pedestrians; robots; saliency; tracking","Authors":"Wong A.S.W., Chalup S.K., Bhatia S., Jalalian A., Kulk J., Nicklin S., Ostwald M.J.","DOI":"10.1080\/00038628.2012.688013","Text":"Visual gaze analysis of robotic pedestrians moving in urban space.

relationships","Abstract":"In recent years, with the growing accessibility of abundant contextual emotion information, which is benefited by the numerous georeferenced user-generated content and the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based emotional computing technics, the emotion layer of human\u2013environment relationship is proposed for enriching traditional methods of various related disciplines such as urban planning. This paper proposes the geographic information system (GIS)-based emotional computing concept, which is a novel framework for applying GIS methods to collective human emotion. The methodology presented in this paper consists of three key steps: (1) collecting georeferenced data containing emotion and environment information such as social media and official sites, (2) detecting emotions using AI-based emotional computing technics such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), and (3) visualizing and analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns with GIS tools. This methodology is a great synergy of multidisciplinary cutting-edge techniques, such as GIScience, sociology, and computer science. Moreover, it can effectively and deeply explore the connection between people and their surroundings with the help of GIS methods. Generally, the framework provides a standard workflow to calculate and analyze the new information layer for researchers, in which a measured human-centric perspective onto the environment is possible. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Collective emotion; GIS-based emotional computing; Human\u2013environment relationship","Authors":"Huang Y., Fei T., Kwan M.-P., Kang Y., Li J., Li Y., Li X., Bian M.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi9090551","Text":"GIS-based emotional computing: A review of quantitative approaches to measure the emotion layer of human\u2013environment relationships.

management of sustainable urban systems hinges on the community embracing these systems. Capturing citizens\u2019 ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics\/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens\u2019 inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs\/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered\/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth\/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects.

problem of scene classification in street-view georeferenced images of urban environments.

The approach is based on the BOSSA representation, which enriches the Bag of Words (BoW) model, in conjunction with the Spatial Pyramid Matching scheme and kernel-based machine learning techniques. The proposed method handles problems that arise in large scale urban environments due to acquisition conditions (static and dynamic objects\/pedestrians) combined with the continuous acquisition of data along the vehicles direction, the varying light conditions and strong occlusions (due to the presence of trees, traffic signs, cars, etc.) giving rise to high intra-class variability. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset of high resolution images collected from two main avenues from the 12th district in Paris and the approach shows promising results. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"kernel-based machine learning; semantic image classification; spatial pyramid matching; street-level images; visual words","Authors":"Iovan C., Picard D., Thome N., Cord M.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2012.171","Text":"Classification of urban scenes from georeferenced images in urban street-view context.

machine learning (ML) for water demand modeling, overcoming the black-box nature of these techniques to extract practical information remains a challenge, especially in developing countries. This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil.

At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale.

hazardous phenomena in mountainous and hilly regions with high and steep terrain. Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"3D kinematic modeling; GIS model; LiDAR; Machine learning; Rockfall hazard","Authors":"Fanos A.M., Pradhan B., Alamri A., Lee C.-W.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12111755","Text":"Machine learning-based and 3d kinematic models for rockfall hazard assessment using LiDAR Data and GIS.

Sector","Abstract":"As the contracts in the road construction sector in Poland are usually of extremely high value and financed from the state budget, the tender procedures should not allow for the non-concurrent behaviours of tender participants. Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed. The created tool can be applied for the future tender procedures as a pre-test of a collusion appearance. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Anysz H., Foremny A., Kulejewski J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/11\/112064","Text":"Comparison of ANN Classifier to the Neuro-Fuzzy System for Collusion Detection in the Tender Procedures of Road Construction Sector.

city level provides unprecedented opportunities to identify urban attributes from various angles. Citizens are likely to evaluate the quality of the neighborhood and make important decisions by their perceptions and the feedback from the environment. In this paper, we studied the correlation between the neighborhood's environment with their properties values and land values.

The result of our approach defines a scenarized profile from building-level details to city-level traits. The main contribution of this work is providing a unique and more accurate perspective to urban valuation estimations, by integrating the scattered sources of pieces of information and implanting into the available images.

has many applications such as intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd surveillance.

We review the performance of several image descriptors. In addition, we propose a straightforward global image descriptor for image retrieval based on compressed sensing theory.

approach","Abstract":"Urban development pattern significantly impacts stream water quality by influencing pollutant generation, build-up, and wash-off processes. It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3\u2212-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3\u2212-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Scenario planning; Urban form; Urban sprawl; Water quality","Authors":"Wang R., Kim J.-H., Li M.-H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.144057","Text":"Predicting stream water quality under different urban development pattern scenarios with an interpretable machine learning approach.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation.

growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project\u2014in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements.

The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. \u00a9 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

use planning","Abstract":"The tasks of democratic urban land use planning, as subjective-objective combined decision-making efforts that require considerable time and energy, have heretofore been accomplished mainly through deep human thought or by voting. In this paper, we introduce a goal-reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can assist with these tasks by combining traditional scenario planning, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) with a novel goal-oriented Monte Carlo tree search (G-MCTS) method. G-MCTS conducts goal-oriented searches to meet the needs of heterogeneous goals and provide the best land use solutions. We evaluated this method on a real-world planning case, and the results show that 1) the goal-reasoning AI agent is good at performing complex goal reasoning tasks with many heterogeneous expert knowledge; 2) different human planning manuscripts could be integrated into a better solution via a goal-reasoning AI agent; and 3) the goal-reasoning AI agent has the potential to make comprehensive decisions during a democratic political agenda. We conclude that the goal-reasoning AI agent, via an improved reinforcement learning (RL) method of G-MCTS, provides vast potential for assisting in subjective-objective combined urban land use planning and many other similar fields by weighing heterogeneous goals, reproducing human inspiration, and acting as a reflexive sociotechnical system. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Goal reasoning; Land use planning; Markov decision processes; Multicriteria decision analysis; Reinforcement learning","Authors":"Chen W., Zhao L., Kang Q., Di F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2020.102703","Text":"Systematizing heterogeneous expert knowledge, scenarios and goals via a goal-reasoning artificial intelligence agent for democratic urban land use planning.

crowd-sensing, it is possible to collect vast amounts of urban data, to better understand how citizens interact with cities and, in turn, improve human well-being in urban environments.

In this work, we turn to artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges, introducing a method whereby the objective, sensor data is analyzed in real-time to scope down the test matrix of the subjective questionnaires. In turn, subjective responses are parsed through AI models to extract further objective information. The outcome is an interactive data analysis framework for urban environments, which we put to test in the context of a citizens' well-being project.

of any modern city. Advertising and information signs on building fa\u00e7ades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on fa\u00e7ades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of fa\u00e7ade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building fa\u00e7ades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality. The resulting approach can provide data for future research and help maintain coherent urban visual environment. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

communities","Abstract":"Electricity theft (ET) causes major revenue loss in power utilities. It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Author Keywords":"big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning","Authors":"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.","DOI":"10.1002\/cpe.6316","Text":"Big data analytics for identifying electricity theft using machine learning approaches in microgrids for smart communities.

modeling","Abstract":"Landslides, one of the most common hazards around the world, have brought about severe damage to life and property of human. To prevent and mitigate landslides, various models have been introduced to assess landslide susceptibility. In this paper, Hoeffding Tree (HT), a prevailing data stream mining algorithm, was employed to predict landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China for the first time. Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances. Concretely, for training dataset, LMT model showed the highest AUC (0.854), followed by HT (0.726) and BN (0.709). However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China.

availability of smart metering infrastructure, high-resolution electric consumption data is readily available to study the dynamics of residential electric consumption at finely resolved spatial and temporal scales. Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer\u2019s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

climate change and rapid urbanization, urban flood disasters spread and become increasingly serious in China. Urban rainstorms and waterlogging have become an urgent challenge that needs to be monitored in real time and further predicted for the improvement of urbanization construction. We trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging. The RNN model has been thoroughly evaluated, and our experimental results showed that it achieved higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT).

cities","Abstract":"A consequence of urbanization is the loss of vegetation cover, replaced by urban areas. This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Change detection index; LST; NDBI; NDVI; Urban heat island; Urban planning","Authors":"Silva A.G.L., Torres M.C.A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.107634","Text":"Proposing an effective and inexpensive tool to detect urban surface temperature changes associated with urbanization processes in small cities.

Following three decades of rapid urban expansion, Shanghai\u2019s urban development model is shifting toward one that emphasizes den-sification and the reuse of existing elements.

serious threat to terrestrial ecosystems. To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction. In future work, the application of the proposed model in other air pollutants or other regions can be explored. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Acid rain; Air pollutant prediction; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Extreme learning machine; Sample entropy; Whale optimization algorithm","Authors":"Sun W., Huang C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2020.115216","Text":"A hybrid air pollutant concentration prediction model combining secondary decomposition and sequence reconstruction.

a cross-city empirical study on micro-climatic thermal benefits of urban trees, using machine-learning analysis to identify the importance of several in situ measured tree physiognomy traits for cooling. Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

transportation systems are geospatially colocated, forming a network of connections. This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity. These findings hold implications for urban planning and water distribution design to mitigate potential cascading failures. \u00a9 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":"Complexity; Interdependency; Transportation networks; Urban morphology; Water distribution networks","Authors":"Abdel-Mottaleb N., Zhang Q.","DOI":"10.1061\/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000563","Text":"Water Distribution-Transportation Interface Connectivity Responding to Urban Geospatial Morphology.

method (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) was integrated with an explorative model, to study the feasibility of using machine learning to reduce the exploration time but providing the same support in long-term water system adaptation planning. The specific network structure and training pattern were determined through a comprehensive statistical trial-and-error (considering the distribution of errors). The network was applied to the case study in Scotchman's Creek, Melbourne. The network was trained with the first 10% of the exploration data, validated with the following 5% and tested on the rest. The overall root-mean-square-error between the entire observed data and the predicted data is 10.5722, slightly higher than the validation result (9.7961), suggesting that the proposed trial-and-error method is reliable. The designed MLP showed good performance dealing with spatial randomness from decentralized strategies. The adoption of MLP-supported planning may overestimate the performance of candidate urban water systems. By adopting the safety coefficient, a multiplicator or exponent calculated by observed data and predicted data in the validation process, the overestimation problem can be controlled in an acceptable range and have few impacts on final decision making. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Adaptation planning; Artificial neural network; Multi-layer perception; Urban planning; Water infrastructure","Authors":"Zhang J., Fu D., Urich C., Singh R.P.","DOI":"10.3390\/su10124600","Text":"Accelerated exploration for long-term urban water infrastructure planning through machine learning.

determine the aesthetic score of a location from social metadata of Flickr photos. In particular, we built machine learning classifiers to predict the class of a location where each class corresponds to a set of locations having equal aesthetic rating. These models are trained on two empirically build datasets containing locations in two different cities (Rome and Paris) where aesthetic ratings of locations were gathered from TripAdvisor.com. In this work we exploit the idea that in a location with higher aesthetic rating, it is more likely for an user to capture a photo and other users are more likely to interact with that photo. Our models achieved as high as 79.48% accuracy (78.60% precision and 79.27% recall) on Rome dataset and 73.78% accuracy(75.62% precision and 78.07% recall) on Paris dataset.

changing rapidly. Currently, community engagement for urban decision-making is often ineffective, uninformed, and only occurs in projects\u2019 later stages. To facilitate a more collaborative and evidence-based urban decision-making process for both experts and non-experts, real-time feedback and optimized suggestions are essential.

Machine learning techniques were applied to achieve real-time prediction of multiple urban simulations, and thousands of city configurations were simulated. The simulation results were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the traffic and solar performance of unseen city configurations. The prediction with the CNN is thousands of times faster than the original simulations and maintains a high-quality representation of the results. This machine learning approach was applied as a versatile, quick, accurate, and computationally efficient method not only for real-time feedback, but also for optimized design recommendations.

areas overcrowded, volume of urban road traffic is increasing. It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related. Building-related indicators include building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and traffic-related indicators include traffic volume, speed and percentage of heavy vehicle. Explanation power of the prediction model derived through machine learning method could verified through correlation, coefficient of determination and k-fold cross validation. \u00a9 2017 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

approach","Abstract":"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July\u2013December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning","Authors":"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2021.148406","Text":"Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach.

sustainable urbanisation strategy, frameworks for detailed large-scale analysis of densification potentials and their evaluation are lacking. A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4\u201315 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)","Author Keywords":"Archetype; Compact city; Machine learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban structure unit","Authors":"Eggimann S., Wagner M., Ho Y.N., Z\u00fcger M., Schneider U., Orehounig K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103068","Text":"Geospatial simulation of urban neighbourhood densification potentials.

concept of smart city has gained in popularity in urban studies. A smart city collects diverse information to monitor and analyze urban systems, such as energy management. It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Energy consumption; Ensemble meta regressor; Machine learning; Smart city; Topical information","Authors":"Carrera B., Peyrard S., Kim K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103025","Text":"Meta-regression framework for energy consumption prediction in a smart city: A case study of Songdo in South Korea.

to significant cooling effect for the city microclimate and, therefore, promote urban residents\u2019 outdoor thermal comfort. As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI\/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5\u00a0ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sun Y., Gao C., Li J., Gao M., Ma R.","DOI":"10.1007\/s00704-021-03665-2","Text":"Assessing the cooling efficiency of urban parks using data envelopment analysis and remote sensing data.

sludge management solutions?","Abstract":"The characteristics of fecal sludge delivered to treatment plants are highly variable. Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities.

of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the simulation of intercity networks. To this end, we implement the random forest MLA to simulate the intercity corporate networks created by Fortune China 500 firms in mainland China. The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940. Nonetheless, the random forest MLA also faces some challenges in the context of the simulation of intercity networks.

The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve.

As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models.

an increasing demand to improve urban resilience. Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience","Authors":"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-76059-5_24","Text":"Planning Support Systems for Long-Term Climate Resilience: A Critical Review.

improve the effect of urban planning, this paper builds a virtual urban planning design model based on GIS big data technology and machine learning algorithms, and proposes a solution that combines multiple features. With the development of polarized SAR in the direction of high resolution, a single feature often cannot fully express the detailed information of ground objects, resulting in poor classification results and low accuracy. The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score.

information systems, and remote sensing data, urban growth modeling has become a viable tool for predicting urbanization of cities and towns, regions, and nations around the world. This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, urban growth models often discard the spatiotemporal uncertainties in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyzed the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on a widely applied cellular automata model known as the SLEUTH CA and the other one based on a previously published machine learning framework. We selected these two models because they are complementary, the first is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the second is more data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori knowledge or bias. To test our methodology, we chose the cities of Jiaxing and Lishui in China because they are representative of new town planning policies and have different characteristics in terms of land extension, geographical conditions, growth rates, and economic drivers. We focused on the spatiotemporal uncertainty, understood as the inherent doubt in the predictions of where and when will a piece of land become urban, using the concepts of certainty area in space and certainty area in time. The proposed analyses in this paper aim to contribute to better urban planning exercises, and they can be extended to other cities worldwide. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

machine-learning approaches using a visual interface","Abstract":"Air quality is one of the most important topics in our urban life, as it is of great significance for human health and urban planning. However, accurate assessment and prediction of air quality in urban areas are difficult. In major cities, typically only a limited number of air quality monitoring stations are available, and inferring air quality in the un-sampled areas throughout the city is challenging. On the other hand, air quality varies in the urban areas non-linearly; it is highly spatially dependent and considerably influenced by multiple factors, such as building distribution, traffic situation and land uses. In this research, we model air quality in the city of Augsburg using spatial features and high quality sensor data. We identify spatial features such as types and areas of different land uses, road networks with high resolution. We integrate open available data to the air quality prediction. In this regard, we compare a simple baseline model with linear regression models (Ordinary Least-Squares and Ridge Regression) and tree-based machine-learning models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest). In our evaluation, given the non-linearity of the data, tree-based models outperform all linear models, which are commonly used in literatures. In addition, we created an interactive and visual dashboard. This dashboard demonstrates the analytical workflow, gives insight into model performance and uncertainty and visualizes the results. \u00a9 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.","Author Keywords":"Air quality; Dashboard; Land-use regression; Machine-learning","Authors":"Shen Y., Lehmler S., Murshed S.M., Riedel T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-51005-3_12","Text":"Characterizing air quality in urban areas with mobile measurement and high resolution open spatial data: Comparison of different machine-learning approaches using a visual interface.

of traffic monitoring devices can be costly from both a financial and human resource point of view. It is therefore important to take advantage of available infrastructures to maximize the information extraction for each technology. Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services. Furthermore, the resulting annotations pave the way for building a historical vehicle counting dataset to be used for analysing the impact of road traffic on many city-related issues such as urban planning, security, and pollution. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Monitoring; Object detection; Regression; Smart cities; Time series; Traffic; Transport","Authors":"Rajotte J.-F., Sotir M., Noiseux C., Noel L.-P., Bertiere T.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2018.00194","Text":"Object Counting on Low Quality Images: A Case Study of Near Real-Time Traffic Monitoring.

China","Abstract":"Agricultural afforestation is an important way to mitigate climate change and improve the environmental quality of city system. The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity. This research highlights the application of machine learning at the high level of smart city management to improve the efficacy and intelligence of urban planning. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Agricultural Afforestation; Beijing; Carbon sequestration; Particle Swarm Optimization; Urban planning","Authors":"Yao J., Kong X., Lal R.","DOI":"10.1109\/SmartWorld.2018.00348","Text":"Using particle swarm optimization method to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation in Beijing, China.

determine the role of path dependency and market forces in the localization decisions of entrepreneurs from different industries. We hypothesize that most industries develop new entities based on the number of companies from the same industry that already exist in a region. We also hypothesize that entrepreneurs create new entities based on related industries operating within the same knowledge pool. To test these hypotheses, we used the machine learning decision tree method. The input variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland in 2009. The target values are the number of new companies from these industries created in the years 2009-2015. The principal results show that localization decisions are mostly based on demand and supply industries, in which manufacturing industries play crucial role. Path dependency appears in less than half of the industries' models and thus is not the main factor influencing decisions regarding the creation of new companies. The highest share of path-dependent industries is in manufacturing sector, but the degree of the dependence is lower than in the service sector. The service sector seems to be the least path-dependent, as services usually serve other industries. Competition in industries is a rare factor in new company creation; however, if it appears, it usually shrinks the industry. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Pylak K., Majerek D.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/245\/6\/062025","Text":"Localization Decisions of Entrepreneurs: The Role of Path Dependency and Market Forces.

region or territory stems from its own dynamic nature. Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the development of a new dynamic-based power market design. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"Computational modeling; Geographic information systems; Machine learning-based data analysis","Authors":"Rai A., Jagadeesh Kannan R.","DOI":"10.22159\/ajpcr.2017.v10s1.19744","Text":"Multi-scale modeling of territorial dynamics of geospatial anthropogenic energy consumption.
