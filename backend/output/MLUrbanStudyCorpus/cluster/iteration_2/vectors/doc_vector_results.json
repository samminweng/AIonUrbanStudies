[{"DocId":5,"Cited by":126.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Partial least-squares regression for linking land-cover patterns to soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds","Abstract":"There are strong ties between land cover patterns and soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds. The spatial configuration of land cover has recently become an important aspect of the study of geomorphological processes related to erosion within watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of soil erosion and sediment yield to land cover patterns in watersheds. However, many landscape metrics are highly correlated and may result in redundancy, which violates the assumptions of a traditional least-squares approach, thus leading to singular solutions or otherwise biased parameter estimates and confidence intervals. Here, we investigated the landscape patterns within watersheds in the Upper Du River watershed (8973km2) in China and examined how the spatial patterns of land cover are related to the soil erosion and sediment yield of watersheds using hydrological modeling and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The results indicate that the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield are closely associated with the land cover patterns. At the landscape level, landscape characteristics, such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), contagion (CONTAG), and patch cohesion index (COHESION), were identified as the primary metrics controlling the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield. The landscape characteristics in watersheds could account for as much as 65% and 74% of the variation in soil erosion and sediment yield, respectively. Greater interspersion and an increased number of patch land cover types may significantly accelerate soilerosion and increase sediment export. PLSR can be used to simply determine the relationships between land-cover patterns and watershed soil erosion and sediment yield, providing quantitative information to allow decision makers to make better choices regarding landscape planning. With readily available remote sensing data and rapid developments in geographic information system (GIS) technology, this practical and simple PLSR approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Co-dependent data; Landscape metrics; Sediment delivery ratio; Sediment yield; Soil erosion","Authors":"Shi Z.H., Ai L., Li X., Huang X.D., Wu G.L., Liao W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2013.06.031","Text":"Partial least-squares regression for linking land-cover patterns to soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds.

and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Data-mining; FANP; Flood risk management; GIS; Urban planning","Authors":"Darabi H., Choubin B., Rahmati O., Torabi Haghighi A., Pradhan B., Kl\u00f8ve B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2018.12.002","Text":"Urban flood risk mapping using the GARP and QUEST models: A comparative study of machine learning techniques.

characteristics of landscape pattern change can reflect the spatial impact of urbanization on the ecological environment. Studying the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns can provide supports for urban ecological management. Previous studies have examined the quantitative relationship between the social economy and landscape patterns of an entire region, but have not considered the spatial non-stability of this relationship. In this study, we characterized the landscape patterns in Beijing City, China during 2000 and 2010 using four landscape metrics, i.e. patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the aggregation index (AI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity and evolution characteristics of the relationship between the urbanization of population density (POP), gross domestic production (GDP) and nighttime lighting (NTL), and landscape patterns. The evolution of urban landscape patterns indicated a decentralized, aggregated, and fragmented change from the downtown to the suburb and outer suburb. During the 10-year period, the average PD in the downtown increased by 100.6%, and the increase of AI in the suburb was the largest. The PD, ED and SHDI increased by different degrees in the outer suburb. The influences of different urbanization modes on landscape patterns were also different. Infilling mode made the landscape patterns more regular and integrated. The landscape was more broken and complicated under the edge-expanding mode, and the leapfrog mode made PD and SHDI increase slightly. In the relationship interpretation, GWR effectively identified the spatial heterogeneity, and improved the explanatory ability compared to ordinary least squares (OLS). The most intense response to urbanization was the forest landscape and the forest-cultivated land ecotone in the northwest of Beijing City, indicating that this region was ecologically fragile. The population density in the urbanization index had a direct effect on landscape patterns, while the PD affected by urbanization was greater than the shape, aggregation and diversity index. Affected by development policy, urban planning and other factors, the explanation degree of social economy to landscape patterns decreased in 2010. GWR is an effective method for quantifying the spatial differentiation characteristics of urbanization impacts on landscape patterns, which can provide more spatial information and decision criteria for the green development of a compact city. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Compact green city Beijing City, China; GWR; Landscape metrics;Urbanization mode","Authors":"Huilei L., Jian P., Yanxu L., Yi'na H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ecolind.2017.06.032","Text":"Urbanization impact on landscape patterns in Beijing City, China: A spatial heterogeneity perspective.

to atmospheric PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u226410 \u03bcm) levels is still lacking, especially in urban environments with close proximity to dust sources. The main objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of dust storms to PM10 concentrations in a desert urban center, the city of Beer-Sheva, Negev, Israel, during the period of 2001-2012. Toward this end, a background value based on the \"dust-free\" season was used as a threshold value to identify potentially \"dust days.\" Subsequently, the net contribution of dust storms to PM10 was assessed. During the study period, daily PM10 concentrations ranged from 6 to over 2000 \u03bcg\/m3. In each year, over 10% of the daily concentrations exceeded the calculated threshold (BVt) of 71 \u03bcg\/m3. An average daily net contribution of dust to PM10 of 122 \u03bcg\/m3 was calculated for the entire study period based on this background value. Furthermore, a dust storm intensity parameter (Ai) was used to analyze several storms with very high PM10 contributions (hourly averages of 1000-5197 \u03bcg\/m3). This analysis revealed that the strongest storms occurred mainly in the last 3 yr of the study. Finally, these findings indicate that this arid urban environment experiences high PM10 levels whose origin lies in both local and regional dust events. Implications:The findings indicate that over time, the urban arid environment experiences high PM10 levels whose origin lies in local and regional dust events. It was noticed that the strongest storms have occurred mainly in the last 3 yr. It is believed that environmental changes such as global warming and desertification may lead to an increased air pollution and risk exposure to human health. \u00a9 2014 Copyright 2014 A&amp;WMA.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Krasnov H., Katra I., Koutrakis P., Friger M.D.","DOI":"10.1080\/10962247.2013.841599","Text":"Contribution of dust storms to PM10 levels in an urban arid environment.

of visible street greenery have been well recognised in a growing literature. Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Accessible greenery; Google Street View; Human-scale; Machine learning; Space syntax; Visible greenery","Authors":"Ye Y., Richards D., Lu Y., Song X., Zhuang Y., Zeng W., Zhong T.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.028","Text":"Measuring daily accessed street greenery: A human-scale approach for informing better urban planning practices.

water is a significant resource for socio-economic growth and the protection of healthy environments. Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies.

describing the presence and the configuration of built-up and open space areas for mapping distinct types of urban form and function at city block level. Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area.

Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level.

China","Abstract":"The spatial structure and function of Xi'an city is significantly affected by urbanization, a factor which can be considered as the main driver of landscape pattern and ecosystem service change. Due to these changes are a response to urban land use and land cover (LULC), remote sensing images are interpreted by the method of supervised classification and visual interpretation to obtain the LULC data for research on landscape pattern index (LPI) and ecosystem service value (ESV) of Xi'an city, China. Combined with urban planning theory, concentric buffer zones were used to explore the characteristics and relationships between LPIs and ESVs along an urban-rural gradient. Ten landscape indices and nine ecosystem service types were selected to analyze the correlation and construct multiple linear regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate the problem of multi-collinearity in the process of model construction. Results indicate that the highest landscape fragmentation was mainly distributed in the urban-rural fringe, 20\u201335 km from the urban center, and patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and landscape shape index (LSI) recorded the highest values. Total ESV of Xi'an city was 20493.65 \u00d7 106 CNY in 2016, and the mean value of ESV increased from 0.06 \u00d7 106 CNY to 2.60 \u00d7 106 CNY along an urban-rural gradient. This finding indicates that a higher ESV was recorded for the natural landscape. Results also indicated that SHAPE_MN, FRAC_MN, PLADJ, and AI recorded a positive effect on total ESV whilst ED and PD have a negative effect on total ESV. Results from the regression models showed quantitative relationships between ESVs and LPIs which revealed how ecosystem service values were affected by the landscape pattern. This study will improve the quantitative assessment method on landscape ecology and provide a basis for further research on city's landscape pattern and ecosystem balance, especially for detecting and evaluating urban-rural development. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Concentric buffer zone; Gradient analysis; Landscape metrics; Multiple linear regression model; PCA","Authors":"Hou L., Wu F., Xie X.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ecolind.2019.105720","Text":"The spatial characteristics and relationships between landscape pattern and ecosystem service value along an urban-rural gradient in Xi'an city, China.

have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and \"interpretability\". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of \"regional centers\" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Amenities; Land use; Public transit; Urban planning","Authors":"Hu N., Legara E.F., Lee K.K., Hung G.G., Monterola C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2016.06.004","Text":"Impacts of land use and amenities on public transport use, urban planning and design.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Citizen science; Solitary bees; Spatial distribution; Sun exposure; Trap nest; Urban landscape structure","Authors":"Everaars J., Strohbach M.W., Gruber B., Dormann C.F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2011.05.008","Text":"Microsite conditions dominate habitat selection of the red mason bee (Osmia bicornis, Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in an urban environment: A case study from Leipzig, Germany.

appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines","Authors":"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108","Text":"A tool for urban soundscape evaluation applying Support Vector Machines for developing a soundscape classification model.

environment features are associated with travel-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions is essential for planners to encourage environmentally sustainable travel through transportation and land use policies. Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range.

Apart from signal processing, four machine learning techniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and clustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between the participants\u2019 physiological responses and environmental conditions.

This study presents a methodology for identifying low-carbon travel block, which can be used to identify the built environment conducive to residents\u2019 low-carbon travel. We chose the four elements of traffic survey\u2014travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency\u2014as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from \u201cWeChat,\u201d a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects\u2014land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types\u2019 building area should be \u201c4:1\u20133:1\u201d; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350\u2013450\u00a0m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15\u201320%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150\u00a0m is 40\u201350%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50\u00a0m is 45\u201360%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100\u00a0m is 50\u201370%.

Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system.

protective effects of street greenery on ecological, psychological, and behavioral phenomena have been well recognized. Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Daily accessed street greenery; Housing price; Human scale; New urban data; Shanghai; Street view images","Authors":"Ye Y., Xie H., Fang J., Jiang H., Wang D.","DOI":"10.3390\/su11061741","Text":"Daily accessed street greenery and housing price: Measuring economic performance of human-scale streetscapes via new urban data.

insurance recognized the relationship between pedestrian environments and public health by providing co-pay for health care delivered in residential land use. In this multi-disciplinary experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA) bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical activity levels with the associated health benefits. A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area. A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of individual or group of these variables to better understand how the built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes.

approach","Abstract":"Climate change has increased the likelihood of the occurrence of disasters like wildfires, floods, storms, and landslides worldwide in the last years. Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Landslide; Machine learning; Naples municipality; Remote sensing; Susceptibility mapping; Wildfire","Authors":"Di Napoli M., Marsiglia P., Di Martire D., Ramondini M., Ullo S.L., Calcaterra D.","DOI":"10.3390\/RS12152505","Text":"Landslide susceptibility assessment of wildfire burnt areas through earth-observation techniques and a machine learning-based approach.

maximum coverage location problem models","Abstract":"The increases in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events due to global climate change and the development of additional pavement, roads and water storage sites due to population growth have enhanced the probability of pluvial flooding (PF) in urban areas. The estimation of urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However, uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the nearest ERC. \u00a9 2019","Author Keywords":"Emergency response point; GIS; Maximum coverage location problem; Pluvial flooding","Authors":"Rizeei H.M., Pradhan B., Saharkhiz M.A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ijdrr.2019.101205","Text":"Allocation of emergency response centres in response to pluvial flooding-prone demand points using integrated multiple layer perceptron and maximum coverage location problem models.

China)","Abstract":"To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR) model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters; especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

opened to the public. Tools for exploitation, analysis and discovery of new knowledge in large data sets are the key to enable citizens to make sense of such large amount of data. The purpose of this work is to analyze how data analysis associated with visualization techniques in different levels can lead to the improvement of the interpretability of open data. With the support of machine learning techniques, these visualizations may improve pattern identification in urban data sets. To guide our discussion, a case study was conducted analyzing socioeconomic data released by the Chicago city government. We discussed the use of different visualizations in this scenario, tailored for univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. We also performed an evaluation of the different forms of visualization proposed in this work. We could observe that allowing the user to explore open urban data using some specific visualizations may lead to more effective data interpretation. \u00a9 2017 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Cluster analysis; Data visualization; Open government data; Sensemaking","Authors":"Barcellos R., Viterbo J., Miranda L., Bernardini F., Maciel C., Trevisan D.","DOI":"10.1145\/3085228.3085294","Text":"Transparency in practice: Using visualization to enhance the interpretability of open data.

investigate whether or not a computer may predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, based on acoustic data only.

Moreover, if the computer was able to make an accurate prediction, we also wanted to know what information it needed to make this prediction.

Based on the Bag of Frames approach, a Support Vector Regression learning algorithm was used to identify relationships between various acoustic features of the acoustics signals and perceived affective quality. We found that the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients provided strong predictions for both Pleasantness (R2 = 0.74) and Eventfulness (R2 = 0.83). This model performed better than the average individual in the experiment in terms of internal consistency of individual assessments.

a data poor environment. Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment.

More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009).

In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape.

planning","Abstract":"As an important element of urban landscapes, park plays an important role in building environmentally sustainable cities. Thus, it is important to examine park accessibility and how it changes over time in relation to community deprivation so as to provide all residents with equitable services. Using the Gaussian-based 2SFCA (two-step floating catchment area) method, this paper analyzes dynamic park accessibility from 2016 to 2018 for communities within the Hangzhou metropolitan area in China and then quantifies the relative role of local contributors to park accessibility changes (population, park and transport network). A machine learning algorithm, which handles the interdependences of deprivation dimensions, is further employed to determine the relationship between community deprivation and park accessibility changes. Results show that park accessibility continued to grow during the study period, and most communities achieved excellent park accessibility by 2018. Population decreases and park increases contribute positively to improved park accessibility, while transport network changes have had less of an impact. Deprived communities have observed a rising trend of park accessibility, while the elderly concentrated communities are more likely to experience declined park accessibility. Our study provides a new methodological framework, which integrates the geographical accessibility model, economic chain substitution model and machine learning algorithm, for understanding the dynamic park access and associated social inequalities in rapidly urbanizing regions. The lessons learned from this study should be insightful for urban planning. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Accessibility; Dynamic changes; Green spaces; Hangzhou; Neighborhood SES; Park; Social deprivation","Authors":"Li Z., Wei H., Wu Y., Su S., Wang W., Qu C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2019.102031","Text":"Impact of community deprivation on urban park access over time: Understanding the relative role of contributors for urban planning.

modeling","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%. These relationships contribute to deriving design strategies and guidelines for designing a sustainable campus. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Data-driven design; Design-driven energy and visibility performance; Generative design; Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS); Parametric modeling; Reinforcement learning","Authors":"Chang S., Saha N., Castro-Lacouture D., Yang P.P.-J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apenergy.2019.04.109","Text":"Multivariate relationships between campus design parameters and energy performance using reinforcement learning and parametric modeling.

energy","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

is a threatening natural hazard in urban areas all over the world, especially in recent years given its increasing frequency of occurrence. In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events \u2013 especially in the future climate \u2013 this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning. \u00a9 2020 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Rainfall threshold; Shenzhen city; Urban pluvial flooding","Authors":"Ke Q., Tian X., Bricker J., Tian Z., Guan G., Cai H., Huang X., Yang H., Liu J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.advwatres.2020.103719","Text":"Urban pluvial flooding prediction by machine learning approaches \u2013 a case study of Shenzhen city, China.

A comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration scales","Abstract":"Understanding how urban forms affect fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations within different seasons is important for sustainable urban development. Thus, the purpose of this study was to quantify the relationships between urban forms and PM2.5 concentration change seasonally in 279 Chinese cities, with the explicit consideration of a comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration scales. A comprehensive evaluation index system of urban forms was calculated based on six urban form metrics (total urban area (CA), number of patches (NP), landscape shape index (LSI), percentage of like adjacencies (PLADJ), patch cohesion index (COHESION), and aggregation index (AI)) by integrating three control variables (temperature, NDVI, and nighttime light). The spatial regression model was subsequently adopted to quantify the effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations. The results revealed that, during the summer and autumn, only urban form compactness was significantly correlated with the PM2.5 concentrations, but more urban form metrics were significantly associated with the PM2.5 concentrations during the spring and winter in Chinese cities. The scattered urban form could effectively reduce the PM2.5 concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing but not in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei during the winter. The effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations become increasingly noticeable from the national scale to the urban agglomeration scale with seasonal change. This study suggests that the urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationships are sensitive to seasonal variations across different regions. Thus, it is an important approach to solve PM2.5 pollution problem to construct an ideal urban form through flexible urban planning strategies. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Chinese cities; Nighttime light; PM2.5 concentrations; Seasonal variation; Urban forms","Authors":"Shi K., Li Y., Chen Y., Li L., Huang C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jclepro.2019.118088","Text":"How does the urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationship change seasonally in Chinese cities?

technologies and the Internet of Things gives us the opportunity to carry out large-scale social studies and to collect vast amounts of data from our cities. In this paper, we investigate a novel way of analyzing data from social sciences studies by employing machine learning and data science techniques. This enables us to maximize the insight gained from this type of studies by fusing both objective (sensor information) and subjective data (direct input from the users). The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas. This paper allows us to gain an overview of certain patterns and the behavior of the citizens within their surroundings and it proves the capabilities of integrating technology into large-scale social studies. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Data analysis; data science; smart cities; social science; urban analytics; urban planning","Authors":"Erhan L., Ndubuaku M., Ferrara E., Richardson M., Sheffield D., Ferguson F.J., Brindley P., Liotta A.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2897217","Text":"Analyzing Objective and Subjective Data in Social Sciences: Implications for Smart Cities.

approaches","Abstract":"Rainfall-induced shallow landslides represent a serious threat in hilly and mountain areas around the world. The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the \u201creach angle\u201d method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This study evaluated both artificial neural network (ANN)and adaptive, network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)algorithms in conjunction with statistical modelling to predict green or grey transformation likelihoods for derelict sites (DS)and vacant sites along waterway corridors (WWC)in Manchester based on ecological, environmental, and social criteria.

Chongqing, China","Abstract":"Accurate and timely classification and monitoring of urban functional zones prove to be significant in rapidly developing cities, to better understand the real and

Many efforts have been undertaken to identify urban functional zones using various classification approaches and multi-source geospatial datasets. The complexity of this category of classification poses tremendous challenges to these studies especially in terms of classification accuracy, but on the opposite, the rapid development of machine learning technologies provides us with new opportunities. In this study, a set of commonly used urban functional zones classification approaches, including Multinomial Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, are examined and compared with the newly developed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, using the case study of Yuzhong District, Chongqing, China. The investigation is based on multi-variate geospatial data, including night-time imagery, geotagged Weibo data, points of interest (POI) from Gaode, and Baidu Heat Map. This study is the first endeavor of implementing the XGBoost model in the field of urban functional zones classification. The results suggest that the XGBoost classification model performed the best and was able to achieve an accuracy of 88.05%, which is significantly higher than the other commonly used approaches.

about urban built-up areas is important for urban planning and management. However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification (BAIC) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the BAIC were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the BAIC to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest (POI), Road Network (RN), nighttime light (NTL), a combination of POI and RN data (POI_RN), a combination of POI and NTL data (POI_NTL), a combination of RN and NTL data (RN_NTL), and a combination of POI, RN, and NTL data (POI_RN_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and AdaBoost. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 76 to 89%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. The largest F1 value and OA were obtained using the POI_RN_NTL data and AdaBoost, while the largest AUC was obtained using POI_RN_NTL and POI_NTL data against AdaBoost, LR, and RF; and (2) the advantages of the BAIC include its support for multi-source input data, its objective accuracy assessment, and its robust classifiers. The BAIC can quickly and efficiently realize the automatic classification of urban built-up areas at a reasonably low cost and can be readily applied to other urban areas in the world where any kind of POI, RN, or NTL data coverage is available. The results of this study are expected to provide timely and effective reference information for urban planning and urban management departments, and could also potentially be used to develop large-scale maps of urban built-up areas in the future. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; NTL; POI; Road network; Urban built-up area","Authors":"Sun L., Tang L., Shao G., Qiu Q., Lan T., Shao J.","DOI":"10.3390\/RS12010091","Text":"A machine learning-based classification system for urban built-up areas using multiple classifiers and data sources.

international development that identifies those within a population who are outperforming their peers in some way, eg, children in low-income families who are well nourished when those around them are not. Analysing and then disseminating the behaviours and other factors underpinning positive deviance are demonstrably effective in delivering development results. However, positive deviance faces a number of challenges that are restricting its diffusion. In this paper, using a systematic literature review, we analyse the current state of positive deviance and the potential for big data to address the challenges facing positive deviance. From this, we evaluate the promise of \u201cbig data-based positive deviance\u201d: This would analyse typical sources of big data in developing countries\u2014mobile phone records, social media, remote sensing data, etc\u2014to identify both positive deviants and the factors underpinning their superior performance. While big data cannot solve all the challenges facing positive deviance as a development tool, they could reduce time, cost, and effort; identify positive deviants in new or better ways; and enable positive deviance to break out of its current preoccupation with public health into domains such as agriculture, education, and urban planning. In turn, positive deviance could provide a new and systematic basis for extracting real-world development impacts from big data. \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Author Keywords":"big data; developing countries; machine learning; mobile data; positive deviance; systematic literature review","Authors":"Albanna B., Heeks R.","DOI":"10.1002\/isd2.12063","Text":"Positive deviance, big data, and development: A systematic literature review.

gaze dynamics of pedestrians can increase our understanding of how important architectural features in urban environments are perceived by pedestrians. The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences. We briefly describe how the obtained multidimensional trajectory data can be analysed by using a temporal behaviour analysis technique based on support vector machines that was developed separately. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"gaze analysis; localization; manifold learning; pedestrians; robots; saliency; tracking","Authors":"Wong A.S.W., Chalup S.K., Bhatia S., Jalalian A., Kulk J., Nicklin S., Ostwald M.J.","DOI":"10.1080\/00038628.2012.688013","Text":"Visual gaze analysis of robotic pedestrians moving in urban space.

planning is to promote health, where the built environment (BE) is believed to play an essential role. This study provides new evidence for the links between body mass index (BMI) and the BE at different geographic scales in a unified framework. Based on a sample of 10,962 individuals across 95 cities in China, this study explores the collective effects of the BE attributes at neighborhood and city levels on BMI using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach. Moreover, whether the relationships between the city-level BE attributes and BMI vary across social groups is revealed. The results indicate that the city-level BE attributes have larger collective effects on BMI than the neighborhood-level BE attributes. Specifically, population size is the greatest contributor to predicting BMI, with a relative importance of 13.92% among all influential factors. Moreover, it is found that the effects of city-level BE attributes vary across different social groups. These findings suggest it is of vital importance for urban planners to coordinate both neighborhood- and city-level BE planning to deter the risks of obesity, and urban planning can be more effective if it is implemented considering local socio-demographic characteristics. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Different geographic scales; Interactive effects; Machine learning method; Obesity; Relative importance","Authors":"Wang X., Shao C., Yin C., Guan L.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2020.103048","Text":"Disentangling the comparative roles of multilevel built environment on body mass index: Evidence from China.

relationships","Abstract":"In recent years, with the growing accessibility of abundant contextual emotion information, which is benefited by the numerous georeferenced user-generated content and the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based emotional computing technics, the emotion layer of human\u2013environment relationship is proposed for enriching traditional methods of various related disciplines such as urban planning. This paper proposes the geographic information system (GIS)-based emotional computing concept, which is a novel framework for applying GIS methods to collective human emotion. The methodology presented in this paper consists of three key steps: (1) collecting georeferenced data containing emotion and environment information such as social media and official sites, (2) detecting emotions using AI-based emotional computing technics such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), and (3) visualizing and analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns with GIS tools. This methodology is a great synergy of multidisciplinary cutting-edge techniques, such as GIScience, sociology, and computer science. Moreover, it can effectively and deeply explore the connection between people and their surroundings with the help of GIS methods. Generally, the framework provides a standard workflow to calculate and analyze the new information layer for researchers, in which a measured human-centric perspective onto the environment is possible. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Collective emotion; GIS-based emotional computing; Human\u2013environment relationship","Authors":"Huang Y., Fei T., Kwan M.-P., Kang Y., Li J., Li Y., Li X., Bian M.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi9090551","Text":"GIS-based emotional computing: A review of quantitative approaches to measure the emotion layer of human\u2013environment relationships.

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil.

At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale.

hazardous phenomena in mountainous and hilly regions with high and steep terrain. Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"3D kinematic modeling; GIS model; LiDAR; Machine learning; Rockfall hazard","Authors":"Fanos A.M., Pradhan B., Alamri A., Lee C.-W.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12111755","Text":"Machine learning-based and 3d kinematic models for rockfall hazard assessment using LiDAR Data and GIS.

cities","Abstract":"Building alteration and redevelopment play a central role in the revitalization of developed cities, where the scarcity of available land limits the construction of new buildings. The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Big data; Building alteration; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Topic modeling","Authors":"Lai Y., Kontokosta C.E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101383","Text":"Topic modeling to discover the thematic structure and spatial-temporal patterns of building renovation and adaptive reuse in cities.

approach","Abstract":"Urban development pattern significantly impacts stream water quality by influencing pollutant generation, build-up, and wash-off processes. It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3\u2212-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3\u2212-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Scenario planning; Urban form; Urban sprawl; Water quality","Authors":"Wang R., Kim J.-H., Li M.-H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.144057","Text":"Predicting stream water quality under different urban development pattern scenarios with an interpretable machine learning approach.

Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation.

growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project\u2014in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements.

The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy.

crowd-sensing, it is possible to collect vast amounts of urban data, to better understand how citizens interact with cities and, in turn, improve human well-being in urban environments.

In this work, we turn to artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges, introducing a method whereby the objective, sensor data is analyzed in real-time to scope down the test matrix of the subjective questionnaires. In turn, subjective responses are parsed through AI models to extract further objective information. The outcome is an interactive data analysis framework for urban environments, which we put to test in the context of a citizens' well-being project.

In particular, the decision process is the main component of every military operation and is of high interest because of two main reasons : it is necessary designed to cope with conflict issues and it requires a very complex planning process to be successful. The difficulty to find a good plan is worse in urban areas because of the high uncertainty due to the topology of these areas, the presence of civilians, who can be hostile or friendly, and the unpredictable nature of enemies. The idea in that paper is to qualify what can be a valid computed plan in that context, i.e. well-designed for recovering of peace, rescue operations after a bombing event, hostage salvage, non-combatant evacuation operations, civil-military co-operation, ., in urban areas. This planning process leads to associate actually four components, the representation of the tactical scheme, the implementation of the tactical scheme as the behaviour of special forces, military units or emergency squads, the proof process or the explanation process, and finally the handling of external factors depending on the current environment or the current context in which the operation takes place. This paper uses a quaternary representation called the epistemological quadriptych, in order to highlight that the integration of UGVs or UAVs devices requires actually to understand the role of knowledge and behaviour and to provide secure and valid action plans, i.e. which can be explained and justified.

communities","Abstract":"Electricity theft (ET) causes major revenue loss in power utilities. It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Author Keywords":"big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning","Authors":"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.","DOI":"10.1002\/cpe.6316","Text":"Big data analytics for identifying electricity theft using machine learning approaches in microgrids for smart communities.

modeling","Abstract":"Landslides, one of the most common hazards around the world, have brought about severe damage to life and property of human. To prevent and mitigate landslides, various models have been introduced to assess landslide susceptibility. In this paper, Hoeffding Tree (HT), a prevailing data stream mining algorithm, was employed to predict landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China for the first time. Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances. Concretely, for training dataset, LMT model showed the highest AUC (0.854), followed by HT (0.726) and BN (0.709). However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China.

availability of smart metering infrastructure, high-resolution electric consumption data is readily available to study the dynamics of residential electric consumption at finely resolved spatial and temporal scales. Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer\u2019s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

climate change and rapid urbanization, urban flood disasters spread and become increasingly serious in China. Urban rainstorms and waterlogging have become an urgent challenge that needs to be monitored in real time and further predicted for the improvement of urbanization construction. We trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging. The RNN model has been thoroughly evaluated, and our experimental results showed that it achieved higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT).

Metropolis, China","Abstract":"Urban greenness plays a vital role in supporting the ecosystem services of a city. Exploring the dynamics of urban greenness space and their driving forces can provide valuable information for making solid urban planning policies. This study aims to investigate the dynamics of urban greenness space patterns through landscape indices and to apply geographically weighted regression (GWR) to map the spatially varied impact on the indices from economic and environmental factors. Two typical landscape indices, i.e., percentage of landscape (PLAND) and aggregation index (AI), which measure the abundance and fragmentation of urban greenness coverage, respectively, were taken to map the changes in urban greenness. As a case study, the metropolis of Wuhan, China was selected, where time-series of urban greenness space were extracted at an annual step from the Landsat collections from Google Earth Engine during 2000\u20132018. The study shows that the urban greenness space not only decreased significantly, but also tended to be more fragmented over the years. Road network density, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), terrain elevation and slope, and precipitation were found to significantly correlate to the landscape indices. GWR modeling successfully captures the spatially varied impact from the considered factors and the results from GWR modeling provide a critical reference for making location-specific urban planning. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

transportation systems are geospatially colocated, forming a network of connections. This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity. These findings hold implications for urban planning and water distribution design to mitigate potential cascading failures. \u00a9 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":"Complexity; Interdependency; Transportation networks; Urban morphology; Water distribution networks","Authors":"Abdel-Mottaleb N., Zhang Q.","DOI":"10.1061\/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000563","Text":"Water Distribution-Transportation Interface Connectivity Responding to Urban Geospatial Morphology.

method (Multi-Layer Perceptron, MLP) was integrated with an explorative model, to study the feasibility of using machine learning to reduce the exploration time but providing the same support in long-term water system adaptation planning. The specific network structure and training pattern were determined through a comprehensive statistical trial-and-error (considering the distribution of errors). The network was applied to the case study in Scotchman's Creek, Melbourne. The network was trained with the first 10% of the exploration data, validated with the following 5% and tested on the rest. The overall root-mean-square-error between the entire observed data and the predicted data is 10.5722, slightly higher than the validation result (9.7961), suggesting that the proposed trial-and-error method is reliable. The designed MLP showed good performance dealing with spatial randomness from decentralized strategies. The adoption of MLP-supported planning may overestimate the performance of candidate urban water systems. By adopting the safety coefficient, a multiplicator or exponent calculated by observed data and predicted data in the validation process, the overestimation problem can be controlled in an acceptable range and have few impacts on final decision making. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Adaptation planning; Artificial neural network; Multi-layer perception; Urban planning; Water infrastructure","Authors":"Zhang J., Fu D., Urich C., Singh R.P.","DOI":"10.3390\/su10124600","Text":"Accelerated exploration for long-term urban water infrastructure planning through machine learning.

determine the aesthetic score of a location from social metadata of Flickr photos. In particular, we built machine learning classifiers to predict the class of a location where each class corresponds to a set of locations having equal aesthetic rating. These models are trained on two empirically build datasets containing locations in two different cities (Rome and Paris) where aesthetic ratings of locations were gathered from TripAdvisor.com. In this work we exploit the idea that in a location with higher aesthetic rating, it is more likely for an user to capture a photo and other users are more likely to interact with that photo. Our models achieved as high as 79.48% accuracy (78.60% precision and 79.27% recall) on Rome dataset and 73.78% accuracy(75.62% precision and 78.07% recall) on Paris dataset.

changing rapidly. Currently, community engagement for urban decision-making is often ineffective, uninformed, and only occurs in projects\u2019 later stages. To facilitate a more collaborative and evidence-based urban decision-making process for both experts and non-experts, real-time feedback and optimized suggestions are essential.

Machine learning techniques were applied to achieve real-time prediction of multiple urban simulations, and thousands of city configurations were simulated. The simulation results were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the traffic and solar performance of unseen city configurations. The prediction with the CNN is thousands of times faster than the original simulations and maintains a high-quality representation of the results. This machine learning approach was applied as a versatile, quick, accurate, and computationally efficient method not only for real-time feedback, but also for optimized design recommendations.

areas overcrowded, volume of urban road traffic is increasing. It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related. Building-related indicators include building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and traffic-related indicators include traffic volume, speed and percentage of heavy vehicle. Explanation power of the prediction model derived through machine learning method could verified through correlation, coefficient of determination and k-fold cross validation. \u00a9 2017 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

approach","Abstract":"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July\u2013December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning","Authors":"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2021.148406","Text":"Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach.

often addressed from the perspective of economic growth and at the national level. In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. \u00a9 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Author Keywords":"density; housing; machine learning; threshold; urban planning","Authors":"Tang B.-S., Ho W.K.O., Wong S.W.","DOI":"10.1002\/sd.2168","Text":"Sustainable development scale of housing estates: An economic assessment using machine learning approach.

inequality","Abstract":"Enriching Asian perspectives on the rapid identification of urban poverty and its implications for housing inequality, this paper contributes empirical evidence about the utility of image features derived from high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning approaches for identifying urban poverty in China at the community level. For the case of the Jiangxia District and Huangpi District of Wuhan, image features, including perimeter, line segment detector (LSD), Hough transform, gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), histogram of oriented gradients (HoG), and local binary patterns (LBP), are calculated, and four machine learning approaches and 25 variables are applied to identify urban poverty and relatively important variables. The results show that image features and machine learning approaches can be used to identify urban poverty with the best model performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.5341 and 0.5324 for Jiangxia and Huangpi, respectively, although some differences exist among the approaches and study areas. The importance of each variable differs for each approach and study area; however, the relatively important variables are similar. In particular, four variables achieved relatively satisfactory prediction results for all models and presented obvious differences in varying communities with different poverty levels. Housing inequality within low-income neighborhoods, which is a response to gaps in wealth, income, and housing affordability among social groups, is an important manifestation of urban poverty. Policy makers can implement these findings to rapidly identify urban poverty, and the findings have potential applications for addressing housing inequality and proving the rationality of urban planning for building a sustainable society. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

sludge management solutions?","Abstract":"The characteristics of fecal sludge delivered to treatment plants are highly variable. Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities.

traditional variable selection procedures employed in the development of geodemographic classifications. It presents a proposal for shifting from a traditional approach for generating general-purpose one-size-fits-all geodemographic classifications to application-specific classifications.

Two local classifications are generated for the city, one a general-purpose classification, and the other, an application-specific classification incorporating supervised Feature Selection methods in the selection of input variables. The discriminatory power of each classification is evaluated and compared, with the result successfully demonstrating the capacity for the application-specific approach to generate a more contextually relevant result, and thus underpins increasingly targeted public policy decision making, particularly in the context of urban planning. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the simulation of intercity networks. To this end, we implement the random forest MLA to simulate the intercity corporate networks created by Fortune China 500 firms in mainland China. The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940. Nonetheless, the random forest MLA also faces some challenges in the context of the simulation of intercity networks.

In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling.

an increasing demand to improve urban resilience. Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience","Authors":"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-76059-5_24","Text":"Planning Support Systems for Long-Term Climate Resilience: A Critical Review.

use information that reflects socio-economic functions and human activities is critically essential for urban planning, landscape design, environmental management, health promotion, and biodiversity

Land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) have facilitated a wide spectrum of applications and further triggered new opportunities in urban studies. New and improved Earth observations, algorithms, and advanced products for extracting thematic urban information, in association with emerging social sensing big data and auxiliary crowdsourcing datasets, all together offer great potentials to mapping fine-resolution EULUC from regional to global scales.

Based on the historical retrospect, we summarize the challenges and limitations of current EULUC studies regarding sample collection, mixed land use problem, data and model generalization, and large-scale mapping efforts. Finally, we propose and discuss future opportunities, including cross-scale mapping, optimal integration of multi-source features, global sample libraries from crowdsourcing approaches, advanced machine learning and ensembled classification strategy, open portals for data visualization and sharing, multi-temporal mapping of EULUC change, and implications in urban environmental studies, to facilitate multi-scale fine-resolution EULUC mapping research. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

improve the effect of urban planning, this paper builds a virtual urban planning design model based on GIS big data technology and machine learning algorithms, and proposes a solution that combines multiple features. With the development of polarized SAR in the direction of high resolution, a single feature often cannot fully express the detailed information of ground objects, resulting in poor classification results and low accuracy. The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score.

to urban public life, activities, and events, and has become a key component of design and regeneration schemes. However, visitors\u2019 experience of public space and the subsequent perceptions and sense of place are often difficult to measure because of its intangible nature and the expensive data collection process. This study collected 20,476 online reviews from 18,387 Tripadvisor users from 2008 to 2019 to understand how visitors experience and react to the public spaces on the Las Vegas Strip. We effectively elicited sense of place on the Las Vegas Strip and quantified the popularity and sentiment of each sense of place facet with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and logistic regression machine learning methods. The results specified 30 distinct topics related to the Strip, among which the most important ones were exploring different hotels, night scene, people watching, and walking long distances. The visitor experience explored within this study uncovered multiple facets of sense of place on the Strip and suggested urban design strategies and public space management policies related to the programmatic and physical elements of the Strip sidewalks. The study shows how online reviews can provide strong empirical evidence for visitor experience in built environment projects. This approach can be used by landscape architects, urban planners, and policy makers on post-occupancy evaluation and guide redevelopment efforts to provide a full feedback loop. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Big data; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Online reviews; Public space; Sense of place","Authors":"Song Y., Wang R., Fernandez J., Li D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2020.103956","Text":"Investigating sense of place of the Las Vegas Strip using online reviews and machine learning approaches.

China","Abstract":"Agricultural afforestation is an important way to mitigate climate change and improve the environmental quality of city system. The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity. This research highlights the application of machine learning at the high level of smart city management to improve the efficacy and intelligence of urban planning. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Agricultural Afforestation; Beijing; Carbon sequestration; Particle Swarm Optimization; Urban planning","Authors":"Yao J., Kong X., Lal R.","DOI":"10.1109\/SmartWorld.2018.00348","Text":"Using particle swarm optimization method to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation in Beijing, China.

region or territory stems from its own dynamic nature. Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the development of a new dynamic-based power market design. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"Computational modeling; Geographic information systems; Machine learning-based data analysis","Authors":"Rai A., Jagadeesh Kannan R.","DOI":"10.22159\/ajpcr.2017.v10s1.19744","Text":"Multi-scale modeling of territorial dynamics of geospatial anthropogenic energy consumption.
