-1,5,126.0,2013,Article,Partial least-squares regression for linking land-cover patterns to soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds,"There are strong ties between land cover patterns and soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds. The spatial configuration of land cover has recently become an important aspect of the study of geomorphological processes related to erosion within watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of soil erosion and sediment yield to land cover patterns in watersheds. However, many landscape metrics are highly correlated and may result in redundancy, which violates the assumptions of a traditional least-squares approach, thus leading to singular solutions or otherwise biased parameter estimates and confidence intervals. Here, we investigated the landscape patterns within watersheds in the Upper Du River watershed (8973km2) in China and examined how the spatial patterns of land cover are related to the soil erosion and sediment yield of watersheds using hydrological modeling and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The results indicate that the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield are closely associated with the land cover patterns. At the landscape level, landscape characteristics, such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), contagion (CONTAG), and patch cohesion index (COHESION), were identified as the primary metrics controlling the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield. The landscape characteristics in watersheds could account for as much as 65% and 74% of the variation in soil erosion and sediment yield, respectively. Greater interspersion and an increased number of patch land cover types may significantly accelerate soilerosion and increase sediment export. PLSR can be used to simply determine the relationships between land-cover patterns and watershed soil erosion and sediment yield, providing quantitative information to allow decision makers to make better choices regarding landscape planning. With readily available remote sensing data and rapid developments in geographic information system (GIS) technology, this practical and simple PLSR approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Co-dependent data; Landscape metrics; Sediment delivery ratio; Sediment yield; Soil erosion,"Shi Z.H., Ai L., Li X., Huang X.D., Wu G.L., Liao W.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.06.031,4.67,1.16
-1,8,101.0,2017,Article,A data-driven predictive model of city-scale energy use in buildings,"Many cities across the United States have turned to building energy disclosure (or benchmarking) laws to encourage transparency in energy efficiency markets and to support sustainability and carbon reduction plans. In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1 million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2 kbtu/sf and for residential buildings is 31.2 kbtu/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings – those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall – are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Building energy; Energy efficiency; Energy prediction; Machine learning; Urban dynamics,"Kontokosta C.E., Tull C.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.005,6.7,1.22
3,9,95.0,2010,Article,Simulating land-use dynamics under planning policies by integrating artificial immune systems with cellular automata,"Cellular automata (CA) have been increasingly used in simulating urban expansion and land-use dynamics. However, most urban CA models rely on empirical data for deriving transition rules, assuming that the historical trend will continue into the future. Such inertia CA models do not take into account possible external interventions, particularly planning policies, and thus have rarely been used in urban and land-use planning. This paper proposes to use artificial immune systems (AIS) as a technique for incorporating external interventions and generating alternatives in urban simulation. Inspired by biological immune systems, the primary process of AIS is the evolution of a set of 'antibodies' that are capable of learning through interactions with a set of sample 'antigens'. These 'antibodies' finally get 'matured' and can be used to identify/classify other 'antigens'. An AIS-based CA model incorporates planning policies by altering the evolution mechanism of the 'antibodies'. Such a model is capable of generating different scenarios of urban development under different land-use policies, with which the planners will be able to answer 'what if' questions and to evaluate different options. We applied an AIS-based CA model to the simulation of urban agglomeration development in the Pearl River Delta in southern China. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can be very useful in exploring various planning scenarios of urban development. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Artificial immune system; Cellular automata; Urban planning; Urban simulation,"Liu X., Li X., Shi X., Zhang X., Chen Y.",10.1080/13658810903270551,4.12,0.02
-1,10,94.0,2017,Article,"Urbanization impact on landscape patterns in Beijing City, China: A spatial heterogeneity perspective","The temporal and spatial characteristics of landscape pattern change can reflect the spatial impact of urbanization on the ecological environment. Studying the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns can provide supports for urban ecological management. Previous studies have examined the quantitative relationship between the social economy and landscape patterns of an entire region, but have not considered the spatial non-stability of this relationship. In this study, we characterized the landscape patterns in Beijing City, China during 2000 and 2010 using four landscape metrics, i.e. patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the aggregation index (AI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity and evolution characteristics of the relationship between the urbanization of population density (POP), gross domestic production (GDP) and nighttime lighting (NTL), and landscape patterns. The evolution of urban landscape patterns indicated a decentralized, aggregated, and fragmented change from the downtown to the suburb and outer suburb. During the 10-year period, the average PD in the downtown increased by 100.6%, and the increase of AI in the suburb was the largest. The PD, ED and SHDI increased by different degrees in the outer suburb. The influences of different urbanization modes on landscape patterns were also different. Infilling mode made the landscape patterns more regular and integrated. The landscape was more broken and complicated under the edge-expanding mode, and the leapfrog mode made PD and SHDI increase slightly. In the relationship interpretation, GWR effectively identified the spatial heterogeneity, and improved the explanatory ability compared to ordinary least squares (OLS). The most intense response to urbanization was the forest landscape and the forest-cultivated land ecotone in the northwest of Beijing City, indicating that this region was ecologically fragile. The population density in the urbanization index had a direct effect on landscape patterns, while the PD affected by urbanization was greater than the shape, aggregation and diversity index. Affected by development policy, urban planning and other factors, the explanation degree of social economy to landscape patterns decreased in 2010. GWR is an effective method for quantifying the spatial differentiation characteristics of urbanization impacts on landscape patterns, which can provide more spatial information and decision criteria for the green development of a compact city. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Compact green city Beijing City, China; GWR; Landscape metrics;Urbanization mode","Huilei L., Jian P., Yanxu L., Yi'na H.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.032,4.74,0.82
-1,14,86.0,2018,Article,Using image recognition to automate assessment of cultural ecosystem services from social media photographs,"Quantifying and mapping cultural ecosystem services is complex because of their intangibility. Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of large numbers of photographs is time consuming. This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm – Google Cloud Vision – to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20% of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Recreation; Recreational ecosystem services; Singapore; Urban ecology,"Richards D.R., Tunçer B., Tunçer B.",10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.09.004,6.98,-1.16
3,29,46.0,2017,Article,Integrating the multi-label land-use concept and cellular automata with the artificial neural network-based Land Transformation Model: an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework,"Cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used by researchers over the last three decades to simulate land-use change (LUC). While conventional CA and ANN models assign a cell to only one land-use class, in reality, a cell may belong to several land-use classes simultaneously. The recently developed multi-label (ML) concept overcomes this limitation in land change science. Although the ML concept is a new paradigm with nonexclusive classes and has shown considerable merit in several applications, few studies in land change science have applied it. In addition, determining transition rules in conventional CA is difficult when the number of drivers is large. Since CA has been shown as a potential model to consider neighborhood effects and ANN has been shown effective in determining CA transition rules, we integrated both CA with an ANN model to overcome limitations of each tool. In this study, we specifically extended the ANN-based Land Transformation Model (LTM) with both a CA-based model and the ML concept to create an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework. We also compared, using standard evaluation measures, differences between the proposed integrated model with a conventional CA-based LTM model (called the ml-CA-LTM). Parameterization was made using a learning and testing procedure common in machine learning. Results showed that the modified LUC model, ML-CA-LTM, produced consistently better goodness of fit calibration values compared to the ml-CA-LTM. The outcome of this modified model can be used by managers and decision makers for improved urban planning. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",artiﬁcial neural networks; cellular automata; land-use change; mono-label class; multi-label classes,"Omrani H., Tayyebi A., Pijanowski B.",10.1080/15481603.2016.1265706,4.29,0.04
0,34,41.0,1996,Article,Artificial intelligence technologies for robot assisted urban search and rescue,"Structural collapse disasters routinely inspire sympathy not only for victims and their families, but also for heroic rescue personnel who are faced with a tremendously complex, hazardous and often frustrating task environment. Military operations and rescue activities in the aftermath of recent earthquakes and bombings indicate a tremendous need for greater access to denied areas within any crisis site involving collapsed structures. Recent developments in the remote inspection industry show great potential for employment of small robotic micro-rover systems in expanded roles for Urban Search and Rescue. This paper discusses key issues in the application of robotic systems to Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) activities and discusses ongoing development of a knowledge-based system for efficient management of automated search assets. USAR modeling and ""micro-bot"" employment advantages are addressed first, followed by a discussion of numerical method shortcomings in the context of search asset allocation. KNOBSAR is then proposed as an initial expert system prototype designed to interact with various structural collapse simulation packages and provide advice on search asset allocation to specific entry points within a crisis site. KNOBSAR structure and design is then illustrated in terms of micro-bot allocation scenarios to various collapsed structure entry points. The conclusion drawn from literature review, experimentation and personal experience is that AI technologies in the form of robotic platforms and decision support tools can have a tremendous impact on overall search efficiency for the USAR community, and represent an important field of study for related military applications.",,Blitch J.G.,10.1016/0957-4174(96)00038-3,5.73,-2.18
-1,35,40.0,2021,Article,Urban water resource management for sustainable environment planning using artificial intelligence techniques,"In the current era, water is a significant resource for socio-economic growth and the protection of healthy environments. Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Artificial intelligence Markov process; Ecology; Environment management; Environment planning; Water,"Xiang X., Li Q., Khan S., Khalaf O.I.",10.1016/j.eiar.2020.106515,6.05,2.07
-1,36,39.0,2017,Article,Mapping urban form and function at city block level using spatial metrics,"This paper focuses on the potential of urban metrics describing the presence and the configuration of built-up and open space areas for mapping distinct types of urban form and function at city block level. Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land use and urban form classification based on these metrics. Our study points out the shortcomings of traditional landscape ecological metrics for mapping urban form and emphasizes the need for alternative approaches for analysing urban landscapes, more explicitly describing the morphological characteristics of the urban fabric. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brussels Capital Region; Land use; Machine learning; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Urban function,"Vanderhaegen S., Canters F.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.023,5.45,-0.34
4,39,38.0,2019,Article,Turning down the heat: An enhanced understanding of the relationship between urban vegetation and surface temperature at the city scale,"Guiding urban planners on the cooling returns of different configurations of urban vegetation is important to protect urban dwellers from adverse heat impacts. To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km 2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 °C (5 °C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales. © 2018",Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Land surface temperature (LST); Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban vegetation,"Duncan J.M.A., Boruff B., Saunders A., Sun Q., Hurley J., Amati M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.223,5.62,1.27
-1,42,36.0,2017,Article,Scale- and region-dependence in landscape-PM2.5 correlation: Implications for urban planning,"Under rapid urbanization, many cities in China suffer from serious fine particulate matter (PMPM2.5) pollution. As the emission sources or adsorption sinks, land use and the corresponding landscape pattern unavoidably affect the concentration. However, the correlation varies with different regions and scales, leaving a significant gap for urban planning. This study clarifies the correlation with the aid of in situ and satellite-based spatial datasets over six urban agglomerations in China. Two coverage and four landscape indices are adopted to represent land use and landscape pattern. Specifically, the coverage indices include the area ratios of forest (F_PLAND) and built-up areas (C_PLAND). The landscape indices refer to the perimeter-area fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Then, the correlation between PMPM2.5 concentration with the selected indices are evaluated from supporting the potential urban planning. Results show that the correlations are weak with the in situ PMPM2.5 concentration, which are significant with the regional value. It means that land use coverage and landscape pattern affect PMPM2.5 at a relatively large scale. Furthermore, regional PMPM2.5 concentration negatively correlate to F_PLAND and positively to C_PLAND (significance at p &lt; 0.05), indicating that forest helps to improve air quality, while built-up areas worsen the pollution. Finally, the heterogeneous landscape presents positive correlation to the regional PMPM2.5 concentration in most regions, except for the urban agglomeration with highly-developed urban (i.e., the Jing-Jin-Ji and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations). It suggests that centralized urbanization would be helpful for PMPM2.5 pollution controlling by reducing the emission sources in most regions. Based on the results, the potential urban planning is proposed for controlling PMPM2.5 pollution for each urban agglomeration.",China; Land use; Landscape; PMPM2.5 concentration; Spatial variability,"Feng H., Zou B., Tang Y.",10.3390/rs9090918,4.96,0.96
4,45,34.0,2018,Article,The effect of multi-dimensional indicators on urban thermal conditions,"Urban heat island (UHI) studies have recognized ten factors as increasing the inner-city temperature compared with that of the surrounding suburbs. The UHI effect is a leading cause of heat-related diseases and mortality in many nations. However, there are still two main shortcomings. First, the effect of UHI is not well recognized in arid and semi-arid regions. Second, the association of multi-dimensional information with surface temperature in urban areas must be examined. This study focuses on the height-related aspects of urban geometry in an arid region. A range of multispectral and spatial vector data were used to derive the surface temperature and two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) information of the study area. All information was aggregated into a grid with common spatial resolution to create a homogeneous dataset. The machine learning statistical model of a boosted regression tree (BRT) was used to reflect the relative influence of 2D and 3D indicators with land surface temperature. Our results showed a cooler surface temperature in the city than in the surrounding area, leading to the question of whether the established UHI definition encompasses all types of cities. In addition, the thermal band was able to distinguish different spatial structures in the study area. The BRT analysis demonstrated that both multi-dimensional 2D and 3D indicators affect the surface temperature. In particular, the 3D indicators play a more important role than 2D indicators in shaping the surface temperature at different urban geometries of the study area. This new method can help urban planners identify the most influential 2D and 3D indicators that affect the surface temperature in different districts of a city. © 2017",3D modeling; Boosted regression tree analysis; Building shadows; Urban ecology; Urban heat island; Urban morphology,"Alavipanah S., Schreyer J., Haase D., Lakes T., Qureshi S.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.187,5.26,1.3

Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people׳s reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard. In addition, this forecasting approach can provide decision support for smog-related health hazard management through functions like early warning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Data mining; Forecasting; Health hazard; Smog disaster; Social media; Urban data,"Chen J., Chen H., Wu Z., Hu D., Pan J.Z.",10.1016/j.is.2016.03.011,7.14,0.95

3,50,32.0,2018,Article,Mining transition rules of cellular automata for simulating urban expansion by using the deep learning techniques,"Along with the gradually accelerated urbanization process, simulating and predicting the future pattern of the city is of great importance to the prediction and prevention of some environmental, economic and urban issues. Previous studies have generally integrated traditional machine learning with cellular automaton (CA) models to simulate urban development. Nevertheless, difficulties still exist in the process of obtaining more accurate results with CA models; such difficulties are mainly due to the insufficient consideration of neighborhood effects during urban transition rule mining. In this paper, we used an effective deep learning method, named convolution neural network for united mining (UMCNN), to solve the problem. UMCNN has substantial potential to get neighborhood information from its receptive field. Thus, a novel CA model coupled with UMCNN and Markov chain was designed to improve the performance of simulating urban expansion processes. Choosing the Pearl River Delta of China as the study area, we excavate the driving factors and the transformational relations revealed by the urban land-use patterns in 2000, 2005 and 2010 and further simulate the urban expansion status in 2020 and 2030. Additionally, three traditional machine-learning-based CA models (LR, ANN and RFA) are built to attest the practicality of the proposed model. In the comparison, the proposed method reaches the highest simulation accuracy and landscape index similarity.

-1,51,32.0,2016,Article,"Impacts of land use and amenities on public transport use, urban planning and design","Various land-use configurations are known to have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and ""interpretability"". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of ""regional centers"" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Amenities; Land use; Public transit; Urban planning,"Hu N., Legara E.F., Lee K.K., Hung G.G., Monterola C.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.06.004,5.28,-0.06

While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions.

In this study, we used three statistical models [frequency ratio, certainty factor and index of entropy (IOE)] and a machine learning model [random forest (RF)] for landslide susceptibility mapping in Wanzhou County, China. First, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier geotechnical investigation reports, aerial images, and field surveys. Then, the redundant factors were excluded from the initial fourteen landslide causal factors via factor correlation analysis. To determine the most effective causal factors, landslide susceptibility evaluations were performed based on four cases with different combinations of factors (“cases”). In the analysis, 465 (70%) landslide locations were randomly selected for model training, and 200 (30%) landslide locations were selected for verification. The results showed that case 3 produced the best performance for the statistical models and that case 2 produced the best performance for the RF model. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to verify the accuracy of each model’s results for its respective optimal case. The ROC curve analysis showed that the machine learning model performed better than the other three models, and among the three statistical models, the IOE model with weight coefficients was superior. © 2019, Science Press and Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Four cases; Landslide susceptibility mapping; Machine learning model; Statistical model,"Xiao T., Yin K., Yao T., Liu S.",10.1007/s11631-019-00341-1,7.86,0.76

An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines,"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108,7.49,-0.52

Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range. These threshold effects offer valuable implications for planners to achieve desirable environmental benefits efficiently. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Machine learning; Travel behavior; Urban form,"Wu X., Tao T., Cao J., Fan Y., Ramaswami A.",10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.018,5.63,0.58
3,75,22.0,2019,Article,Simulation of urban expansion via integrating artificial neural network with Markov chain–cellular automata,"Accurate simulations and predictions of urban expansion are critical to manage urbanization and explicitly address the spatiotemporal trends and distributions of urban expansion. Cellular Automata integrated Markov Chain (CA-MC) is one of the most frequently used models for this purpose. However, the urban suitability index (USI) map produced from the conventional CA-MC is either affected by human bias or cannot accurately reflect the possible nonlinear relations between driving factors and urban expansion. To overcome these limitations, a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network, ANN) was integrated with CA-MC instead of the commonly used Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Logistic Regression (LR) CA-MC models. The ANN was optimized to create the USI map and then integrated with CA-MC to spatially allocate urban expansion cells. The validated results of kappa and fuzzy kappa simulation indicate that ANN-CA-MC outperformed other variously coupled CA-MC modelling approaches. Based on the ANN-CA-MC model, the urban area in South Auckland is predicted to expand to 1340.55 ha in 2026 at the expense of non-urban areas, mostly grassland and open-bare land.

The framework includes signal frequency unification, signal pairing, signal filtering, signal quantification, and data labeling. Furthermore, this paper contributes to human-environment interaction research, where a field study to understand the influence of environmental features such as varying sound level, illuminance, field-of-view, or environmental conditions on humans’ perception was proposed. In the study, participants of various demographic backgrounds walked through an urban environment in Zürich, Switzerland while wearing physiological and environmental sensors. Apart from signal processing, four machine learning techniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and clustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between the participants’ physiological responses and environmental conditions. The predictive models with high accuracies indicate that the change in the field-of-view corresponds to increased participant arousal.

Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R2 = 0.36–0.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R2 = 0.68–0.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Air quality; Calibration; Low-cost sensing; Machine learning; Urban,"Johnson N.E., Bonczak B., Kontokosta C.E.",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.019,6.81,0.77

We take full advantage of the benefits of new technology, but also clarify that city is not a machine, also cannot fully mechanically control the urban development. This study presents a methodology for identifying low-carbon travel block, which can be used to identify the built environment conducive to residents’ low-carbon travel. We chose the four elements of traffic survey—travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency—as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from “WeChat,” a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects—land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types’ building area should be “4:1–3:1”; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350–450 m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15–20%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150 m is 40–50%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50 m is 45–60%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100 m is 50–70%. The results confirm that “functional mixing” and “dense road network” are beneficial to residents’ low-carbon travel proposed by the predecessors. At the same time, we found that not the higher volume rate is, the more favorable for low-carbon travel. Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system. It is not that the higher the bus station coverage is, the better for residents to travel as low-carbon, and the high popularity of public transportation in small cities will increase the carbon emission of residents. The study provides a new way to evaluate the carbon emission assessment of blocks and provides a basis for block planning with low-carbon concept. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Block; Built environment; GIS hotspot analysis; Low-carbon travel,"Hou Q., Zhang X., Li B., Zhang X., Wang W.",10.1007/s00521-018-3447-8,5.54,0.32

To this end, building on a previously reported method [1], we develop a fast-running Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Model (NIROM) for predicting the turbulent air flows found within an urban environment. To resolve larger scale turbulent fluctuations, we employ a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and solve the resulting computational model on unstructured meshes. The objective is to construct a rapid-running NIROM from these results that will have ‘similar’ dynamics to the original LES model. Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and machine learning techniques, this Reduced Order Model (ROM) is six orders of magnitude faster than the high-fidelity LES model and we demonstrate how ‘similar’ it can be to the high-fidelity model by comparing statistical quantities such as the mean flows, Reynolds stresses and probability densities of the velocities. We also include validation of the high-fidelity model against data from wind tunnel experiments. This paper represents a key step towards the use of reduced order modelling for operational purposes with the tantalising possibility of it being used in place of Gaussian plume models, and the potential for greatly improved model fidelity and confidence. © 2018",Gaussian process regression; Machine learning; Non-intrusive reduced order modelling; Operational modelling; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Urban flows,"Xiao D., Heaney C.E., Mottet L., Fang F., Lin W., Navon I.M., Guo Y., Matar O.K., Robins A.G., Pain C.C.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.035,6.77,0.92

However, few studies have discussed the impact of physical urban form features on the land surface temperature (LST) from a perspective of comprehensive urban spatial structures. This study used the ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and random forest regression (RF) to distinguish the relative contributions of urban form metrics on LST at three observation scales. Results of this study indicate that more than 90% of the LST variations were explained by selected urban form metrics using RF. Effects of the magnitude and direction of urban form metrics on LST varied with the changes of seasons and observation scales. Overall, building morphology and urban ecological infrastructure had dominant effects on LST variations in high-density urban centers. Urban green space and water bodies demonstrated stronger cooling effects, especially in summer. Building density (BD) exhibited significant positive effects on LST, whereas the floor area ratio (FAR) showed a negative influence on LST.

4,95,17.0,2020,Article,The effects of 3D architectural patterns on the urban surface temperature at a neighborhood scale: Relative contributions and marginal effects,"Urban architecture is an important contributor to urban heat island (UHI) effects. Yet thorough investigations into how three-dimensional (3D) architectural patterns influence urban thermal conditions collectively and individually are limited. This study bridges this gap by adopting a machine learning method, boosted regression tree (BRT), to analyze the relative influences and marginal effects of 3D urban architecture on land surface temperature (LST). Ten architectural metrics are incorporated to describe the composition and configuration of 3D architectural patterns at a neighborhood scale in the typical megacity of Shanghai. The results show that in summer, the building coverage ratio (BCR), mean architecture height (MAH), mean architecture height standard deviation (AHSD) and mean architecture projection area (MAPA) are the most influential factors, with relative contributions of 39.3%, 16.5%, 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively. The regulation amplitudes (ΔT) of the dominant metrics for the neighborhood average LST temperature are 2.7 °C, 0.9 °C, 0.6 °C, and 0.6 °C, respectively. Moreover, with the LST, the BCR exhibits a monotonic positive correlation, the MAH and AHSD show a stepwise negative correlation, and the MAPA shows a combination of positive and negative correlation. It is generally recommended to decrease the development intensity and architectural base area, while increase the building height and roughness to improve the urban thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale. The dominant contributors and related marginal effects are generally consistent across different seasons. These findings can provide quantitative insights for mitigating the LST effects via rational design and management of 3D architectural patterns. Given the distinctive insights provided, the BRT method is recommended for disentangling the relationship between LST and environmental variables in upcoming studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",3D architectural pattern; Boosted regression tree (BRT); Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI),"Sun F., Liu M., Wang Y., Wang H., Che Y.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120706,5.67,1.01
4,98,17.0,2012,Article,Analysis on spatiotemporal changes of urban thermal landscape pattern in the context of urbanisation: A case study of Xiamen City,"Cities are centers of political, economic, cultural and social life. It is a symbol of human civilization and development, and urbanization is a common trend in many countries. Nowadays, world urbanization accelerates greatly, especially in developing countries. While providing great economic and social benefits, urbanization has also created some environmental problems, including the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI has deep impacts on material cycles and energy transfers within urban ecosystems, and has become an important issue in urban climate and environmental research. Xiamen is one of the special economic zones, and its rapid urbanization induced the UHI becoming much more intense and extensive. To study UHI from a viewpoint of landscape is a new method in urban thermal environment research. Analyzing the dynamics of the urban thermal landscape in the context of urbanization will provide support for environmental protection, energy use policy making, and urban planning and management. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of urban thermal landscape pattern in the main area of Xiamen City. Firstly, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal images, which were acquired on similar dates in the winter of 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007, were used to retrieve brightness temperature. Then a relative brightness temperature (R) was calculated and the thermal patches were classified into 6 grades by temperature difference. Landscape metrics were used here at both landscape and class level to quantify changes in the urban thermal landscape pattern. And they can describe the changes of thermal landscape pattern in 3 aspects, including quantity, shape and structure. Finally, we investigated the distribution of thermal pollution sources in Xiamen. The results showed that: 1) In terms of quantity, with the rapid urbanization of Xiamen City between 1987 and 2007, the thermal landscape became more fragmented, and was more and more dominated by high-grade thermal landscape patches. 2) The shape of high-grade thermal patches even the whole landscape tends to complex. 3) For structure, each grade of thermal landscape became well-distributed and even. The new high-grade thermal patches were found close to the old ones that induced the proximity index (PROX_MN) of high-grade thermal patches increased; the aggregation index (AI) of the whole landscape decreased while the high-grade thermal patches increased; the contagion index (CONTAG) of the whole landscape also decreased so that dominance of high-grade thermal patches gradually increased. 4) The area of thermal patches which converted from low-grade to high-grade is bigger than the area converted from high-grade to low- grade. According to statistical analysis, we found that it is much easier that the high-grade thermal landscape patches converted into the middle-grade thermal landscape than converted among high grades. 5) The high-grade thermal patches mainly distributed in the industry area, and they were increased remarkably. All the high-grade thermal patches experienced three kinds of changes (increasing number, expanding area and increasing grade), and grouped into five high temperature zones (Haicang, Xinyang, Xinglin, seaport of Xiamen island and airport), especially in the industrial districts of Xinyang and Xinglin.",Landscape pattern; Urban heat island; Urbanisation; Xiamen City,"Huang J., Zhao X., Tang L., Qiu Q.",10.5846/stxb201012071745,5.15,1.12

However, the neighborhood effects of the driving factors are rarely considered in the exploration of the transition suitability of cells, leading to lower simulation accuracy. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-VCA model that adopts the CNN to extract the high-level features of the driving factors within a neighborhood of an irregularly shaped cell and discover the relationships between multiple land use changes and driving factors at the neighborhood level. The proposed model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China. Compared with several VCA models using other machine learning methods, the proposed CNN-VCA model obtained the highest simulation accuracy (figure-of-merit = 0.361). The results indicated that the CNN-VCA model can effectively uncover the neighborhood effects of multiple driving factors on the developmental potential of land parcels and obtain more details on the morphological characteristics of land parcels.

Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify.

Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques).

Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level.

However, although increasingly used, it is difficult to find a clear meaning and definition of what the term represents. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), using text-mining and machine learning algorithms, this article investigates what are the conceptual basis of the nexus governance debate, and attempts to clarify the main themes, networks, and gaps within this literature. The analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative methods, combining social network analysis (SNA) and discourse analysis (DA).

A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments. © 2020 by the authors.

It may be argued that this is impossible, because a computer lack life experience. Moreover, if the computer was able to make an accurate prediction, we also wanted to know what information it needed to make this prediction. We recruited 33 students (18 female; Mage = 25.4 yrs., SDage = 3.6) out of which 30 assessed how pleasant and eventful 102 unique soundscape excerpts (30 s) from Stockholm were. Based on the Bag of Frames approach, a Support Vector Regression learning algorithm was used to identify relationships between various acoustic features of the acoustics signals and perceived affective quality. We found that the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients provided strong predictions for both Pleasantness (R2 = 0.74) and Eventfulness (R2 = 0.83). This model performed better than the average individual in the experiment in terms of internal consistency of individual assessments. Taken together, the results show that a computer can predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, which is promising for future soundscape mapping. © 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA).

-1,140,10.0,2017,Book Chapter,How should urban planners be trained to handle big data?,"Historically urban planners have been educated and trained to work in a data poor environment. Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment. For decades they have learned how to use census data, which is comprehensive on several basic variables, but is only conducted once per decade so is almost always out of date. More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009). Planners are still being trained in methods that are suitable for a data poor environment (J Plan Educ Res 6:10–21, 1986; Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data: the big data revolution!, 101–104, 2011; J Plan Educ Res 15:17–33, 1995). In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape. We will discuss how these methods can be integrated into the planning curriculum as well as planning practice. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Analytics; Big data; Education; Urban planning; Visualization,"French S.P., Barchers C., Zhang W.",10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_12,6.04,-1.06

Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System is a limited-area working model with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km for estimating local-scale weather forecasts on the Korean peninsula. However, in order to numerically predict the detailed temperature characteristics of the urban space, in which surface characteristics change rapidly in a small spatial area, a city temperature prediction model with higher resolution spatial decomposition capabilities is required. As an alternative to this, a building-scale temperature model was developed, and a 25 m air temperature resolution was determined for the Seoul area. The spatial information was processed using statistical methods, such as linear regression models and machine learning. By comparing the accuracy of the estimated air temperatures with observational data during the summer, the machine learning was improved. In addition, horizontal and vertical characteristics of the urban space were better represented, and the air temperature was better resolved spatially. Air temperature information can be used to manage the response to heat-waves and tropical nights in administrative districts of urban areas. © 2018 by the authors.",Building-scale air temperature; Heat-exposure map; Heat-wave; Statistical downscaling; Weather information service,"Yi C., Shin Y., Roh J.-W.",10.3390/atmos9050164,6.26,1.1

3,155,8.0,2020,Article,Improving land-use change modeling by integrating ANN with Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model,"Urban growth and land-use change are a few of many puzzling factors affecting our future cities. Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions. This will play a vital role in sustaining Jordan's food security. © 2020Environmental science, Computer science, Geography, Land use planning, Land use change, Urban growth, Machine learning, Urban planning, Modeling; Artificial intelligence, Cellular Automata, Markov Chain. © 2020",Artificial intelligence; Cellular Automata; Computer science; Environmental science; Geography; Land use change; Land use planning; Machine learning; Markov Chain; Modeling; Urban growth; Urban planning,"Gharaibeh A., Shaamala A., Obeidat R., Al-Kofahi S.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05092,4.72,0.26

This research aims to assess the impacts of multi-level land use policies and plans and their effectiveness in protecting farmland, and to recommend policies to remedy defective ones. Markov Chain–Cellular Automata modelling was integrated with machine learning to predict future urbanization. The results show that prior to the establishment of the District in late 2010, the urban area grew at 13% annually because local policies promoted profit-motivated development. This rate declined drastically to 4% during 2011–2012 in direct response to the changed local land use policies and strict enforcement of national policies. These policies stabilized the urbanization rate at 7% over the subsequent years. The safeguard of previous farmland was possible only when the national policies were aligned closely with the local policies in their aim, provided both were rigorously enforced through a land management agency. Urban land in 2020 is predicted to growth by at least 464 km2 with some differences between two scenarios. In the baseline scenario (no change in policies), almost 70% of new growth will take place inside three industry zones and the duty-free ports. However, in the national overall plan scenario, a significant amount of marginal farmland will be changed into greenfields within the planned urban zones. It is recommended that a hierarchical farmland protection policy be implemented. It should incorporate the national policies that must be adapted to the local settings to achieve sustainable urbanization and to minimize farmland loss. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial neural network; Land use change; Land use policies and plans; Markov Chain – Cellular Automata (MC-CA); Rapid urbanization; Spatiotemporal analysis,"Xu T., Gao J., Li Y.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104030,4.53,0.05

In this paper, we investigate a novel way of analyzing data from social sciences studies by employing machine learning and data science techniques. This enables us to maximize the insight gained from this type of studies by fusing both objective (sensor information) and subjective data (direct input from the users). The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas.

4,165,8.0,2016,Article,Studying spatial and temporal changes of aridity in Iran,"Optimum use of water in agriculture, drinking, and industry is necessary in arid and semi-arid regions like Iran, which face serious water tensions. Since studying aridity and its trend of changes has a significant role in water resources management and urban planning, this research has investigated spatial and temporal changes and trend of aridity changes in Iran as an arid country. To study the issue, 51 weather stations of Iran which covered a 30-year statistical period (1981–2010) were selected. Climatic variables, namely precipitation, vapor pressure, local pressure, temperature, maximum temperature, and relative humidity and required data to calculate the potential evapotranspiration were extracted from Iran meteorology organization data. In next step by applying Ai, Im, and Iq aridity indices, zoning of the aridity was done after studying the aridity traits and its change. Then the most compatible aridity index was introduced according to the values of correlation between climatic factors of aridity indices and the magnitude of each main climatic area of Iran. Furthermore, in order to recognize aridity changes in Iran during the selected 30-year period, Mann-Kendal nonparametric test was used. Correlation analysis results showed that 35.4 and 64.6 % of Iran arid areas show more compatibility with Im and Ai, respectively, which means that these indices are more appropriate to study aridity in arid regions of Iran. Also, it was revealed that 5.6 and 94.3 % of Caspian south plain region has more compatibility with Ai and Iq indices, respectively. As a matter of fact, 77.8, 0.75, and 21.4 % of the country area can be studied better by Ai, Iq, and Im, respectively. Also, the results of Mann-Kendal nonparametric test confirmed that aridity is developing in Iran. In other words, 80.4 % of Iran area had increasing trend of aridity during the selected period and in just 19.6 % of the area, aridity trend was not significant or decreasing. © 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Aridity; Aridity index; Iran; Trend of aridity changes; Zoning,"Zolfaghari H., Masoompour J., Yeganefar M., Akbary M.",10.1007/s12517-016-2379-9,5.12,1.18

2,168,7.0,2021,Article,"Rainfall-induced shallow landslide detachment, transit and runout susceptibility mapping by integrating machine learning techniques and gis-based approaches","Rainfall-induced shallow landslides represent a serious threat in hilly and mountain areas around the world. The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the “reach angle” method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. © 2021 by the authors.

Although there are related reviews, none investigated urban data for use in modelling occupant behaviour and energy use at multiple scales, from buildings to neighbourhood to city. This survey paper aims to fill this gap by providing a critical summary and analysis of the works reported in the literature. We present the different sources of occupant-centric urban data that are useful for data-driven modelling and categorise the range of applications and recent data-driven modelling techniques for urban behaviour and energy modelling, along with the traditional stochastic and simulation-based approaches.

While most previous studies focused on two-dimensional urban development, the spatial characteristics of building heights are rarely explored. Such information could provide valuable implications for smart urban planning and management. However, previous attempts did not systematically investigate the spatial factors that influence building heights and their associations with urban development. Therefore, this study developed a machine learning-based method to compare the distributions of building heights in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two cities with different development patterns. First, we collected detailed information on the buildings, such as the location and land values. Second, the height of each building was simulated based on the above information using the well-known random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and artificial neural network. The random forests algorithm outperformed the other two in both cities. We also found that the commercial land value is the most important factor associated with building heights. Moreover, the building heights in Guangzhou are more sensitive to the distances to administrative centers, while the distances to transportation networks exert stronger influences on the building heights in Shenzhen. Overall, these findings could support urban planning and management. More importantly, the proposed method can be used to predict the heights of new buildings and investigate the distributions of building heights in other regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Building heights; Machine learning; Spatial factors; Urban modeling,"Lin J., Wan H., Cui Y.",10.1016/j.scs.2019.101854,6.0,0.23

However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification (BAIC) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the BAIC were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the BAIC to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest (POI), Road Network (RN), nighttime light (NTL), a combination of POI and RN data (POI_RN), a combination of POI and NTL data (POI_NTL), a combination of RN and NTL data (RN_NTL), and a combination of POI, RN, and NTL data (POI_RN_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and AdaBoost. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 76 to 89%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. The largest F1 value and OA were obtained using the POI_RN_NTL data and AdaBoost, while the largest AUC was obtained using POI_RN_NTL and POI_NTL data against AdaBoost, LR, and RF; and (2) the advantages of the BAIC include its support for multi-source input data, its objective accuracy assessment, and its robust classifiers. The BAIC can quickly and efficiently realize the automatic classification of urban built-up areas at a reasonably low cost and can be readily applied to other urban areas in the world where any kind of POI, RN, or NTL data coverage is available.

-1,196,6.0,2009,Conference Paper,The cooperative conceptualization of urban spaces in ai-assisted environmental planning,"The literature on spatial environments concerns many disciplines, and the present study aims at broadly contributing from an urban-planning view. Indoor and outdoor townscapes, because of their dynamic complexity, seem to offer ill-structured holds to the typical spatial behaviour of an agent. Therefore, a question arises about the 'fundamentals' of spacescapes from the point of view of the needs of living and moving agents. Following this thread, the paper deals with the diagnosis and the control of a structured simple space, a minimum arc of a graph. Conditions, situations, elements, behaviours are explored in their spatial-temporal dimensions, subsequently aiming at setting up a system architecture to let spatial agents control their de-structuring impact. Text analysis and interpretation are applied to a questionnaire survey, exploring low level (movement orientation) and high level (memories and fantasies) behaviours in human interaction with a space.

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =∼130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities. Ethics and dissemination This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations. ©",epidemiology; public health; statistics & research methods,"Clark S.N., Alli A.S., Brauer M., Ezzati M., Baumgartner J., Toledano M.B., Hughes A.F., Nimo J., Bedford Moses J., Terkpertey S., Vallarino J., Agyei-Mensah S., Agyemang E., Nathvani R., Muller E., Bennett J., Wang J., Beddows A., Kelly F., Barratt B., Beevers S., Arku R.E.",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035798,6.7,0.69
-1,208,5.0,2018,Article,Game-based crowdsourcing to support collaborative customization of the definition of sustainability,"Successful adoption and management of sustainable urban systems hinges on the community embracing these systems. Capturing citizens’ ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens’ inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Computational linguistic; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Social media; Sustainability; Urban infrastructure,"Nik Bakht M., El-Diraby T.E., Hossaini M.",10.1016/j.aei.2018.08.019,6.42,-1.45

Load predictions will help in developing demand side management in coordination with renewable power generation. Urban area load is influenced by meteorological conditions therefore it is important to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting. This paper explores the use of regression tool for regional electric load forecasting by correlating lower distinctive categorical level (season and day of the week) and weather parameters. The historical electrical load datasets with meteorological parameters are available for the Sydney region and they have been used to test the regression tools. Data correlation over seasonal changes have been argued by means of improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE). By examining the structure of various regressors they are compared for the lowest MAPE. The regressors show good MAPE for short term (30 min) prediction and Random Forest Regressor scores best in the range of 1-2 % MAPE. © 2018 University of Split, FESB.",Electric Load Forecasting; k-NN; Machine Learning; Regression Tools,"Johannesen N.J., Kolhe M., Goodwin M.",,6.88,1.6

More precisely, the goal of this task is semantic image classification, consisting in predicting in a given image, the presence or absence of a pre-defined class (e.g. shops, vegetation, etc.). The approach is based on the BOSSA representation, which enriches the Bag of Words (BoW) model, in conjunction with the Spatial Pyramid Matching scheme and kernel-based machine learning techniques. The proposed method handles problems that arise in large scale urban environments due to acquisition conditions (static and dynamic objects/pedestrians) combined with the continuous acquisition of data along the vehicles direction, the varying light conditions and strong occlusions (due to the presence of trees, traffic signs, cars, etc.) giving rise to high intra-class variability.

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale.

Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment. © 2020 by the authors.",3D kinematic modeling; GIS model; LiDAR; Machine learning; Rockfall hazard,"Fanos A.M., Pradhan B., Alamri A., Lee C.-W.",10.3390/rs12111755,7.77,0.48

The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Optical Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) night-time light datasets provided consistent and valuable data sources for investigating urbanization processes. This study intends to empirically investigate the relationship between night-time lights, population, and urban development patterns. A novel protocol was developed to integrate heterogeneous datasets into a standardized unit of analysis. Multivariate mixed-effects models were applied to detect correlations within and between provinces in South Korea. To capture physical variations of urban development, four landscape metrics were used and tested in the analyses. Diminishing returns of night-time lights to population were found in all models. In single landscape metric models, all coefficients of landscape metrics were positively related to night-time lights. In combination models, the aggregation index (AI) was no longer statistically significant. The protocol developed in this study provides an effective way to create analytical units for integrating heterogeneous forms of data. Creating standardized units of analyses will make it possible for researchers to compare their results with other studies. Landscape metrics used in this study for capturing the composition and configuration of urban development patterns will enrich the discussion in the future. © 2019 by the authors.",City size; Land cover; Moving window; Satellite imagery; Urban scaling law,"Kang M., Jung M.C.",10.3390/rs11182140,4.9,0.7

Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed.

It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3−-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3−-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation.

In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project—in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization.

-1,259,3.0,2020,Conference Paper,Machine Learning Assisted Urban Filling,"When drawing urban scale plans, designers should always define the position and the shape of each building. This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks. The analysis of different machine learning models trained by the data from different cities inspires urban designers with design strategies and features in distinct conditions. © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Artificial intelligence; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Urban design,"Shen J., Liu C., Ren Y., Zheng H.",,6.15,-0.39
2,266,3.0,2018,Conference Paper,Structural health monitoring installation scheme using utility computing model,"In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena, there is a pressing need for an efficient environment logging that provides structural information to administrators for a better management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility model for structural health monitoring that would enable early detection of risk factors and mitigation of loss. The proposed utility computing model takes the input data in terms of 'number of occupants' in a building (i.e. MAC, International Mobile Equipment Identifier addresses and biometric attendance system installed) and SHM system data (i.e. sensors readings). It give visual representation of all the data for utility managers and experts to decide better location of SHM and number of SHM needed per zone depending on high disturbances created due to higher occupancy and number of structures per zone. Denser area with higher structures and higher population will require more precise and accurate SHM systems compared to rural areas. It also analyzes the data from SHM system and using simple machine learning algorithm give experts' suggestions for type of SHM needed at an area. It make it possible for the data of each and every device of SHM systems over several zones to be accessible by specific authorities that can be used to predict as well as forecast any natural disaster. The Structural Health Monitoring utility model is unique in terms of its heterogeneity of resource management in realizing the utility processes. Finally, a case study of Qatar University is looked at where nodes are distributed in zones along with occupant measuring is used over each building. The data was taken over simulated occupation models and mathematical models from literature for occupation and zone calculation using ideal SHM system data. It can be inferred from the data that real-time analysis data will act similar to simulated and proposed Utility Computing System will give visual data and analyze the zones as can be seen in the results. Therefore, SHM Utility Computing model is efficient and most effective system that save cost as well as prepare authorities for maintenance of a structure or crisis management due to external surroundings. © 2018 IEEE.",Geographical Area Network (GAN); Internet of Things (IoT); Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Things as a Service (TaaS); Utility Computing,"Tariq H., Al-Hitmi M.A.E., Tahir A., Crescini D., Touati F., Manouer A.B.",10.1109/EECS.2018.00019,7.38,0.24

We applied this personality classification task using several machine learning algorithms, such as: Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Tree. Training is performed on a relatively dataset of manually annotated excerpts. By combining these features spaces from psychology and computational linguistics, we perform and evaluate our approaches to detecting personality, and eventually develop a classifier that is nearly 83% accurate on our dataset.

5,283,2.0,2021,Article,Geosilhouettes: Geographical measures of cluster fit,"Regionalization, under various guises and descriptions, is a longstanding and pervasive interest of urban studies. With an increasingly large number of studies on urban place detection in language, behavior, pricing, and demography, recent critiques of longstanding regional science perspectives on place detection have focused on the arbitrariness and non-geographical nature of measures of best fit. In this paper, we develop new explicitly geographical measures of cluster fit. These hybrid spatial–social measures, called geosilhouettes, are demonstrated to capture the “core” of geographical clusters in racial data on census blocks in Brooklyn neighborhoods. These new geosilhouettes are also useful in a variety of boundary analysis and outlier detection problems. In this paper, the thinking behind geosilhouettes is presented, their mathematical form is defined, they are demonstrated, and new directions of research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.",clustering; Data science; segregation; unsupervised learning; urban sociology,"Wolf L.J., Knaap E., Rey S.",10.1177/2399808319875752,4.93,-0.89
1,287,2.0,2020,Article,Learning from urban form to predict building heights,"Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. © 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

This study uses the large inflow of immigrants in Barcelona between 1998 and 2008 to study whether the configuration of buildings and open urban areas in a block is associated with the residential segregation of immigrants—a proxy for social interaction. Based on a rich set of shape metrics, I use machine learning techniques to classify each block in Barcelona into one of eight typologies, which provide a summary measure of their built environment. I then combine these data with measures of residential segregation constructed at the building level using data on the exact address of each resident of Barcelona. The findings show that some features of the built environment of a block—as measured by the typologies—are systematically associated with reduced residential segregation of Spaniards and newly arrived immigrants in that block. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Machine learning; Segregation; Urban design; Urban form,Salazar Miranda A.,10.1016/j.cities.2020.102852,5.05,-0.84

In this paper, we introduce a goal-reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can assist with these tasks by combining traditional scenario planning, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) with a novel goal-oriented Monte Carlo tree search (G-MCTS) method. G-MCTS conducts goal-oriented searches to meet the needs of heterogeneous goals and provide the best land use solutions. We evaluated this method on a real-world planning case, and the results show that 1) the goal-reasoning AI agent is good at performing complex goal reasoning tasks with many heterogeneous expert knowledge; 2) different human planning manuscripts could be integrated into a better solution via a goal-reasoning AI agent; and 3) the goal-reasoning AI agent has the potential to make comprehensive decisions during a democratic political agenda. We conclude that the goal-reasoning AI agent, via an improved reinforcement learning (RL) method of G-MCTS, provides vast potential for assisting in subjective-objective combined urban land use planning and many other similar fields by weighing heterogeneous goals, reproducing human inspiration, and acting as a reflexive sociotechnical system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Goal reasoning; Land use planning; Markov decision processes; Multicriteria decision analysis; Reinforcement learning,"Chen W., Zhao L., Kang Q., Di F.",10.1016/j.cities.2020.102703,5.34,-1.78

To address this limitation of existing urban models, this paper presents two urban modeling techniques for an unmanned aircraft flight simulation in an urban environment. The first proposed urban modeling technique is an airborne LiDAR source-based approach that incorporates machine learning algorithms to identify the number of buildings and characterize them from the LiDAR information. The second proposed urban modeling technique is an artificial urban modeling technique without any airborne LiDAR resources that applies an adaptive spacing method, an iterative algorithm to define an artificial urban environment. Unlike the LiDAR source-based approach that creates an approximated urban model, the adaptive spacing-based urban modeling algorithm generates an artificial urban environment that is visually different from a reference city, but has similar the characteristics to it.

Various studies in the field of urban planning and design have given recommendations on “good urban form”, suggesting that especially characteristics of the urban morphology inform the quality of locations and additionally influence spatial behavior. While we find a growing number of quantitative spatial models such as hedonic price models, location choice models, or applied machine learning algorithms, characteristics describing the urban morphology are still rarely reported in these. One reason can be found in the limited knowledge on how to characterize the urban morphology best. In this chapter, we address this deficit and define attributes that are suitable to characterize the urban morphology in quantitative means at different scales. We show how these can be processed from a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in most study areas and process them for the case study of Switzerland. Finally, we use the attributes to define urban typologies through clustering methods.

It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning,"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.",10.1002/cpe.6316,7.01,1.43

To prevent and mitigate landslides, various models have been introduced to assess landslide susceptibility. In this paper, Hoeffding Tree (HT), a prevailing data stream mining algorithm, was employed to predict landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China for the first time. Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances. Concretely, for training dataset, LMT model showed the highest AUC (0.854), followed by HT (0.726) and BN (0.709). However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China.

Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer’s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Change detection index; LST; NDBI; NDVI; Urban heat island; Urban planning,"Silva A.G.L., Torres M.C.A.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107634,5.44,1.09

This is certainly the case with experimental urban planning and design solutions and sustainability transitions. This article identifies and evaluates the role of pilot projects and demonstration zones along the Huangpu River. These clusters and zones are supposed to guide the urban regeneration of the former industrial waterfronts and to accelerate innovative development in Shanghai and the wider Yangtze Delta Region. The Huangpu River as a whole is considered an urban lab and a showcase of ecological civilisation policies, with a strong ‘people oriented’ focus on improving the overall quality and attractiveness of urban life. Following three decades of rapid urban expansion, Shanghai’s urban development model is shifting toward one that emphasizes den-sification and the reuse of existing elements. The motto of Shanghai’s latest master plan is “Striving for an Excellent Global City.” One of the pathways to realize this expectation is the creation of thematic clusters for creative industries, financial institutes, AI, and technology, media and telecommunication industries. These clusters are high‐density investment projects meant to support and accelerate the transformation of Shanghai into a service economy. There are important sim-ilarities between these projects in Shanghai and the role of urban labs in theories of sustainability transitions. Drawing on these theories and those of ecological civilization, this article examines how these so‐called ‘experimental’ urban megapro-jects along the river contribute to Shanghai’s effort to take the lead in developing sustainable urban transitions. © 2021 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Ecological civilization; Global city; Port city; Sustainability transitions, urban lab; Urban megaprojects; Urban regeneration; Waterfront transformation",Den Hartog H.,10.17645/up.v6i3.4194,4.85,-0.35

Model performance can be improved by integrating exogenous features from open data repositories (e.g., weather, housing prices, traffic, etc.), but these uncurated sources are often too noisy, incomplete, and biased to use directly. We propose to learn integrated representations, called EquiTensors, from heterogeneous datasets that can be reused across a variety of tasks. We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with ""oracle""models that use hand-selected datasets. © 2021 ACM.",data integration; fairness in machine learning; neural networks; open data; spatial-temporal predictions,"Yan A., Howe B.",10.1145/3448016.3452777,6.89,-0.17

To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction.

Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity.

-1,355,1.0,2020,Article,Access and forms of urbanity in public space: Transit urban design beyond the global north,"There has been an emerging interest in the study of urban design dimensions associated with Transit-Oriented Developments (TODs). However, addressing the question of how TOD principles laid out in the international literature can be explored in the context of the global South remains in an incipient stage. In this paper, we investigate the nexus between station walkable catchments and forms of urbanity around transit nodes by adopting an assemblage approach to cut across any separation of sociality and spatiality. Drawing on empirical research from two case studies in Tehran, this paper contributes to studies on transit urban design by developing two measures of accessibility-the Catchment of Accessible Public Spaces (CAPS) and Accessible Interfaces (AI). We found that the combination of high CAPS and high AI within a given time can enable streetlife intensity, which is also linked to a synergistic effect of a larger assemblage, including the number of entries and diversity of functions. We argue that a focus on both measures is critical to understand the performance and potential transformation of street networks in a TOD. © 2020 by the authors.",Accessibility; Global south; Public space; Public/private interface; Transit-oriented development; Urban design; Urban morphology; Urbanism; Urbanity; Walkability,"Peimani N., Kamalipour H.",10.3390/SU12083495,5.25,-0.43

The specific network structure and training pattern were determined through a comprehensive statistical trial-and-error (considering the distribution of errors). The network was applied to the case study in Scotchman's Creek, Melbourne. The network was trained with the first 10% of the exploration data, validated with the following 5% and tested on the rest. The overall root-mean-square-error between the entire observed data and the predicted data is 10.5722, slightly higher than the validation result (9.7961), suggesting that the proposed trial-and-error method is reliable. The designed MLP showed good performance dealing with spatial randomness from decentralized strategies. The adoption of MLP-supported planning may overestimate the performance of candidate urban water systems. By adopting the safety coefficient, a multiplicator or exponent calculated by observed data and predicted data in the validation process, the overestimation problem can be controlled in an acceptable range and have few impacts on final decision making. © 2018 by the authors.",Adaptation planning; Artificial neural network; Multi-layer perception; Urban planning; Water infrastructure,"Zhang J., Fu D., Urich C., Singh R.P.",10.3390/su10124600,5.99,1.62

The computational experiment was held using the backward propagation of errors method of training the artificial neural network, which was trained based on the geometry of the details of the Roman Corinthian order capital. During the experiment, as an input training data set, five local geometry parameters combined has given the best results: Theta, Pi, Rho in spherical coordinate system based on the capital volume centroid, followed by Z value of the Cartesian coordinate system and a distance from vertical planes created based on the capital symmetry. Additionally during the experiment, artificial neural network hidden layers optimal count and structure was found, giving results of the error below 0.2% for the mentioned before input parameters. Once successfully trained artificial network, was able to mimic the details composition on any other geometry type given. Despite of calculating the transformed geometry locally and separately for each of the thousands of surface points, system could create visually attractive and diverse, complex patterns. Designed tool, based on the supervised learning method of machine learning, gives possibility of generating new architectural forms- free of the designer's imagination bounds.

It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related. Building-related indicators include building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and traffic-related indicators include traffic volume, speed and percentage of heavy vehicle.

Therefore, implementation of landslides susceptibility models is essential in urban planning. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the possible applicability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in landslides susceptibility prediction. We have built a classification problem with two classes, landslides and stable areas, and applied SVMs algorithms in the districts Bytča, Kysucké Nové Mesto and Žilina. A spatial database of landslides areas and geologically stable areas from the State Geological Institute of Dionýz Štúr were used to fit SVMs models. Four environmental input parameters, land use, lithology, aspect and slope were used to train support vector machines models. During the training phase, the primal objective was to find optimal sets of kernel parameters by grid search. The linear, polynomial and radial basis function kernels were computed. Together 534 models were trained and tested with LIBLINEAR and LIBSVM libraries. Models were evaluated by Accuracy parameter. Then the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and landslides susceptibility maps were produced for the best model for every kernel. The best predictive performance was gained by radial basis function kernel. This kernel has also the best generalization ability. The results showed that SVMs employed in the presented study gave promising results with more than 0.90 (the area under the ROC curve (AUC) prediction performance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Landslide susceptibility; Machine learning; Receiver operating characteristic; Support vector machines; Validation,"Karell L., Muňko M., Ďuračiová R.",10.1007/978-3-319-45123-7_27,7.9,0.55

Researchers have applied machine learning models to generate 2D drawings with pixels or 3D models with voxels, but the pixelization reduces the precision of the geometries. Therefore, in order to learn and generate 3D geometries as vectorized models with higher precision and faster computation speed, we develop a specific artificial neural network, learning and generating design features for the forms of buildings. A customized data structure with feature parameters is constructed, meeting the requirements of the neural network by rebuilding surfaces with controlling points and appending additional input neurons as quantified vectors to describe the properties of the design. The neural network is first trained with generated design data and then tested by adjusting the feature parameters. The prediction of the generated data shows the basic generative ability of the neural network. Furthermore, trained with design data collected from existing buildings, the neural network learns and infers the geometric design features of architectural design with different feature parameters, providing a data-driven method for designers to generate and analyze architectural forms. © 2021 The Authors",Architectural form finding; Artificial neural networks; Computational design; Machine learning,"Zheng H., Yuan P.F.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108178,6.24,-0.51
-1,413,,2021,Article,Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach,"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July–December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. © 2021 The Authors",Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning,"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148406,6.29,1.37

A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4–15 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. © 2021 The Author(s)",Archetype; Compact city; Machine learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban structure unit,"Eggimann S., Wagner M., Ho Y.N., Züger M., Schneider U., Orehounig K.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103068,4.88,-0.58

A smart city collects diverse information to monitor and analyze urban systems, such as energy management. It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting.

4,424,,2021,Article,Assessing the cooling efficiency of urban parks using data envelopment analysis and remote sensing data,"Urban parks can contribute to significant cooling effect for the city microclimate and, therefore, promote urban residents’ outdoor thermal comfort. As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5 ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"Sun Y., Gao C., Li J., Gao M., Ma R.",10.1007/s00704-021-03665-2,5.55,1.34

A variable drop-off loop function, based on the concept of early termination for reduction of model capacity, regularization, and generalization control, was tested. A susceptibility index for airborne particulate matter of less than 10 μm diameter (PM10) was modeled using monthly maximum values and spectral bands and indices from Landsat 8 imagery, and Open Street Maps were used to prepare a range of independent variables. Probability and classification index maps were prepared using extreme-gradient boosting (XGBOOST) and random forest (RF) algorithms.

The algorithm relies on a mixed-use of decentralized Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the A pathfinder. Each UAV has elementary cognitive skills to sense information about the nearby environment which are then fed as an input to the network. The neural network creates a correlation between the current state of a UAV and the best action to take at each time step. The exploration strategy is stored in a labeled database for the single-UAV case; the neural network learns and replicates it in the multi-UAV case, being able to generalize the acquired skills over new maps not contained in the database.

Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. © 2021 The Authors",fecal sludge; image analysis; machine learning; Random forest; sanitation; WASH,"Ward B.J., Andriessen N., Tembo J.M., Kabika J., Grau M., Scheidegger A., Morgenroth E., Strande L.",10.1016/j.watres.2021.116997,6.42,1.9

The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940.

The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is −15.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model.

Several machine learning regression techniques are analysed and employed for deriving missing height data from digitised multi-temporal maps. The implemented method relies on geometric, neighbours, and categorical attributes for height prediction.

Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience,"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.",10.1007/978-3-030-76059-5_24,5.21,0.29

1,481,,2021,Article,Virtual design of urban planning based on GIS big data and machine learning,"In order to build a virtual urban planning model and improve the effect of urban planning, this paper builds a virtual urban planning design model based on GIS big data technology and machine learning algorithms, and proposes a solution that combines multiple features. With the development of polarized SAR in the direction of high resolution, a single feature often cannot fully express the detailed information of ground objects, resulting in poor classification results and low accuracy. The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score. The research results show that the model constructed in this paper meets the expected goals. © 2021 - IOS Press.

3,485,,2021,Article,Analyzing the spatiotemporal uncertainty in urbanization predictions,"With the availability of computational resources, geographical information systems, and remote sensing data, urban growth modeling has become a viable tool for predicting urbanization of cities and towns, regions, and nations around the world. This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, urban growth models often discard the spatiotemporal uncertainties in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyzed the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on a widely applied cellular automata model known as the SLEUTH CA and the other one based on a previously published machine learning framework. We selected these two models because they are complementary, the first is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the second is more data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori knowledge or bias. To test our methodology, we chose the cities of Jiaxing and Lishui in China because they are representative of new town planning policies and have different characteristics in terms of land extension, geographical conditions, growth rates, and economic drivers. We focused on the spatiotemporal uncertainty, understood as the inherent doubt in the predictions of where and when will a piece of land become urban, using the concepts of certainty area in space and certainty area in time. The proposed analyses in this paper aim to contribute to better urban planning exercises, and they can be extended to other cities worldwide. © 2021 by the authors.

-1,524,,2020,Conference Paper,"AI application on LID stormwater management and urban planning in Guam, USA, and Southern China, PRC","Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the usage of AI technologies for hydrological and hydraulic modelling on the application of water resource management. In early model stage, AI methods were used primarily for prediction and forecasting, utilizing quantitative data. With SCADA and sensor applications with internet of things (IOT), AI technologies have increasingly been used for the incorporation of qualitative and subjective information into real time monitoring. With rapid calculation of model results and decision support systems (the AI process), the drainage system can control hydrological devices such as pumps, valves, or gates to adjust or control the flow rate of a drainage system as well as urban drainage ability to model complex hydrological systems in an integrated fashion. There are three parts to the AI applications on blockchain water platform (BWP). From the upstream of BWP, sensors and meters will be able to collect hydrological data such as rain gauge, flowrate, pressure in pipes, and key indicators of water quality. This information will input into hydrological and hydraulic modelling, many engineering modelling software have been used for predicting flow with the scenario analysis. The engineer will be able to run the model 24/7 to collect data from the studying watershed. With continuous updated results, they will be able to obtain real time monitoring. Finally, through the results from the modelling system, operation procedure, drainage analysis, and the decision support system (DSS), control devices such as pumps, valves, and gates will have the ability to be controlled wirelessly. The AI process will allow the urban stormwater drainage to optimize their operation and produce the most efficient results for urban drainage. With this approach, AI will link the sensor data by internet of things (IOT) into the model with model analysis. The overall benefits of using AI storm water management include an increase of energy efficiency, a decrease in flood risks, and a decrease in cost.

-1,544,,2019,Conference Paper,Object Counting on Low Quality Images: A Case Study of Near Real-Time Traffic Monitoring,"The installation and management of traffic monitoring devices can be costly from both a financial and human resource point of view. It is therefore important to take advantage of available infrastructures to maximize the information extraction for each technology. Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services. Furthermore, the resulting annotations pave the way for building a historical vehicle counting dataset to be used for analysing the impact of road traffic on many city-related issues such as urban planning, security, and pollution. © 2018 IEEE.",Monitoring; Object detection; Regression; Smart cities; Time series; Traffic; Transport,"Rajotte J.-F., Sotir M., Noiseux C., Noel L.-P., Bertiere T.",10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00194,6.99,-0.38
3,560,,2018,Conference Paper,"Using particle swarm optimization method to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation in Beijing, China","Agricultural afforestation is an important way to mitigate climate change and improve the environmental quality of city system. The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity.

-1,565,,2018,Conference Paper,"The technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, artificial intelligence and earth observation","Earth observation is one of the most important applications in downstream space activities. It is widely used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, topographic mapping, agricultural censuses and disaster prevention. However, traditional satellite remote sensing is subject to high cost and long data acquisition cycles, and it is difficult for users to get the data in time. These problems result in insufficient data supply capacity of remote sensing satellites, which leads to difficulties in supporting daily business applications and establishing a fast-growing business model business models. The small satellite segment has seen rapid market growth and technological advancements since 2013 following the multiple successful launches, most notably the Planet, Spire and others. Economies of scale during production are one of the core advantages of the small satellites segment, thus allowing for significant cost reduction throughout their development and production cycles. At the same time, big data analysis and the artificial intelligence (AI) industries are booming. Periodically full coverage data from small satellites provides a data source for data mining and periodic statistics for a wide range of targets. It provides huge opportunities and extension channels for the applications of big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in Earth observation (EO). The present paper describes research on the technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. In the first section of the paper, a literature review of the common downstream space activities along with identifying the limitations of Earth Observation in terms of high cost and long data acquisition cycles is presented. In the second section, the paper outlines a 4G case study to show that how the improvement of infrastructure brings new application scenarios, verticals and consumers. In the third section, the paper considers the possible new market opportunities of the 5G technology in the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. Finally, it concludes by proposing two prototype models in agriculture monitoring and disaster and emergency responses, assesses the technical and commercial increment relative to the current business.

5,570,,2017,Conference Paper,Localization Decisions of Entrepreneurs: The Role of Path Dependency and Market Forces,"The purpose of this research is to determine the role of path dependency and market forces in the localization decisions of entrepreneurs from different industries. We hypothesize that most industries develop new entities based on the number of companies from the same industry that already exist in a region. We also hypothesize that entrepreneurs create new entities based on related industries operating within the same knowledge pool. To test these hypotheses, we used the machine learning decision tree method. The input variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland in 2009. The target values are the number of new companies from these industries created in the years 2009-2015. The principal results show that localization decisions are mostly based on demand and supply industries, in which manufacturing industries play crucial role. Path dependency appears in less than half of the industries' models and thus is not the main factor influencing decisions regarding the creation of new companies. The highest share of path-dependent industries is in manufacturing sector, but the degree of the dependence is lower than in the service sector. The service sector seems to be the least path-dependent, as services usually serve other industries. Competition in industries is a rare factor in new company creation; however, if it appears, it usually shrinks the industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Pylak K., Majerek D.",10.1088/1757-899X/245/6/062025,4.71,-1.16
-1,571,,2017,Article,Multi-scale modeling of territorial dynamics of geospatial anthropogenic energy consumption,"Objective: The development of any region or territory stems from its own dynamic nature. Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the development of a new dynamic-based power market design. © 2017 The Authors.",Computational modeling; Geographic information systems; Machine learning-based data analysis,"Rai A., Jagadeesh Kannan R.",10.22159/ajpcr.2017.v10s1.19744,5.92,0.73

0,592,,2009,Conference Paper,Understanding townscapes through AI approaches to the study of human living in space,"Spatial environments have been studied by many scholars in different disciplines, and the present study aims at contributing to the broader discussion from an urban-planning view. Indoor and outdoor townscapes, because of their dynamic complexity, seem to offer ill-structured holds to the typical spatial behaviour of an agent, particularly when spatial behaviours is analyzed in mainstream AI robotics. Therefore, a question arises about the 'fundamentals' of spacescapes from the point of view of the needs of living agents, having to live in and move through them in resilient and intelligent ways. In this context, the subject of the present paper is the diagnosis and the control of a structured simple space, geometrically intended as the minimum arc of a graph. Conditions, situations, elements, behaviours are explored and partially analyzed in their spatial-temporal dimensions, subsequently aiming at setting up a system architecture to let spatial agents control their de-structuring impact. The research makes use of text analysis and interpretation, both applied to an in-class questionnaire survey, exploring low level (movement orientation) and high level (memories and fantasies) behaviours in human interaction with a space.

0,596,,2005,Conference Paper,A knowledge-based creation of mathematical programming for GIS problem solving,"Nowadays the biggest challenge to GIS is the model design of theme analyzing. Many GIS applications need more functions in analysis and decision-making than in data organization or visualization. While confronted with an application like planning a new metro line in a city, the typical GIS cannot accomplish it by itself, unless some human experts or artificial intelligence technology are involved. Numbers of GIS applications essentially are models of theme analyzing, and they are also examples of problem solving in AI. Therefore many theories and technologies from AI can be embedded in GIS to strengthen its ability of automatic analysis. Fortunately mathematical programming is a kind of powerful tool to settle problems with a demand of optimization under some constraint conditions. Many GIS applications happen to be this type, and some mathematical models can usually approximate them accurately. Two new questions aroused. The first is what objective function and constraint conditions that constitute a mathematical programming should be, and the second is how to acquire those mathematical expressions. Due to the establishment of a mathematical programming is highly knowledge-based, so an AI subsystem is designed to autonomously create a mathematical programming. This problem has a typical characteristic of multiple domains crossing from perspective of Knowledge Engineering, so some novel knowledge-processing methods, like knowledge dependence, knowledge transition and knowledge reference, are studied. And a knowledge system represented by frames and a reference-based knowledge-using method are presented here. © 2005 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; Automatic programming; GIS,"Wei H., Xu Q.-X.",10.1109/IGARSS.2005.1525265,5.89,-1.81
