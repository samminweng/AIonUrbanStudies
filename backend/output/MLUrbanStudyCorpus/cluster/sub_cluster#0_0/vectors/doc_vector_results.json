neighborhoods of urban centers may be helpful in a number of contexts including urban planning, content delivery and activity recommendations for mobile web users or may even yield to a deeper understanding of the geographical evolution of social life in the city. During the past few years, the analysis of mobile phone usage patterns, or of social media with longitudinal attributes, have aided the automatic characterization of the dynamics of the urban environment. In this work, we combine a dataset sourced from a telecommunication provider in Spain with a database of millions of geo-tagged venues from Foursquare and we formulate the problem of urban activity inference in a supervised learning framework. In particular, we exploit user communication patterns observed at the base station level in order to predict the activity of Foursquare users who checkin-in at nearby venues. First, we mine a set of machine learning features that allow us to encode the input telecommunication signal of a tower. Subsequently, we evaluate a diverse set of supervised learning algorithms using labels extracted from Foursquare place categories and we consider two application scenarios. Initially, we assess how hard it is to predict specific urban activity of an area, showing that Nightlife and Entertainment spots are those easier to infer, whereas College and Shopping areas are those featuring the lowest accuracy rates. Then, considering a candidate set of activity types in a geographic area, we aim to elect the most prominent one. We demonstrate how the difficulty of the problem increases with the number of classes incorporated in the prediction task, yet the classifiers achieve a considerably better performance compared to a random guess even when the set of candidate classes increases. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"cellular data; location-based services; urban mining","Authors":"Noulas A., Mascolo C., Frias-Martinez E.","DOI":"10.1109\/MDM.2013.27","Text":"Exploiting foursquare and cellular data to infer user activity in urban environments.

functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter, tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424).

many aspects of life, from the global spread of infectious diseases to urban planning and daily commute patterns. In recent years, the prevalence of positioning methods and technologies, such as the global positioning system, cellular radio tower geo-positioning, and WiFi positioning systems, has driven efforts to collect human mobility data and to mine patterns of interest within these data in order to promote the development of location-based services and applications. The efforts to mine significant patterns within large-scale, high-dimensional mobility data have solicited use of advanced analysis techniques, usually based on machine learning methods, and therefore, in this paper, we survey and assess different approaches and models that analyze and learn human mobility patterns using mainly machine learning methods. We categorize these approaches and models in a taxonomy based on their positioning characteristics, the scale of analysis, the properties of the modeling approach, and the class of applications they can serve. We find that these applications can be categorized into three classes: user modeling, place modeling, and trajectory modeling, each class with its characteristics. Finally, we analyze the short-term trends and future challenges of human mobility analysis. \u00a9 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Data mining; Human mobility patterns; Machine learning; Mobile phones","Authors":"Toch E., Lerner B., Ben-Zion E., Ben-Gal I.","DOI":"10.1007\/s10115-018-1186-x","Text":"Analyzing large-scale human mobility data: a survey of machine learning methods and applications.

expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Citizen persona; Citizen profile; Citizen-centered big data; Data merging; Data-analysis algorithm; Governance intelligence; Ontology model; Smart cities","Authors":"Ju J., Liu L., Feng Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.telpol.2018.01.003","Text":"Citizen-centered big data analysis-driven governance intelligence framework for smart cities.

In this paper, we propose a semantic framework that integrates the IoT with machine learning for smart cities.

challenges for urban planning and management in metropolitan areas around the world. One way to tackle the problem is to resort to the emerging technologies in artificial intelligence. Traffic light control is one of the most traditional and important instruments for urban traffic management. The present study proposes a traffic light control system enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework in a decentralized manner. In the framework, a traffic network is decomposed into regions represented by region agents. Each region consists of intersections, modeled by intersection agents who coordinate with neighboring intersection agents through communication. For each intersection, a collection of turning movement agents operate individually and implement optimal actions according to local control policies. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm for each turning movement agent, the intersection controllers are enabled with the capability to make their timing decisions in a complex and dynamic environment. In addition, the traffic light control operates with an advanced phase composition process dynamically combining compatible turning movements. Moreover, the collective operations performed by the agents in a road network are further coordinated by varying priority settings for relevant turning movements. A case study was carried out by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed control system while comparing it with an optimized vehicle-actuated control system. The results show that the proposed traffic light system, after a collective machine learning process, not only improves the local signal operations at individual intersections but also enhances the traffic performance at the regional level through coordination of specific turning movements. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Collective machine learning; Decentralized system; Hierarchical model of traffic system; Learning-based control; Multi-agent traffic light control","Authors":"Jin J., Ma X.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.engappai.2017.10.013","Text":"Hierarchical multi-agent control of traffic lights based on collective learning.

In this paper, we leverage large human mobility data to craft an extensive set of features for crime prediction, as informed by theories in criminology and urban studies.

Our study shows that spatial and spatio-temporal features derived from Foursquare venues and checkins, subway rides, and taxi rides, improve the baseline models relying on census and POI data. The proposed models achieve absolute R2 metrics of up to 65% (on a geographical out-of-sample test set) and up to 89% (on a temporal out-of-sample test set).

We deep-dive into the main crime categories, and find that the predictive gain of the human dynamics features varies across crime types: such features bring the biggest boost in case of grand larcenies, whereas assaults are already well predicted by the census features.

critical for many aspects of city planning, design, and management, including transportation, public health, emergency response, and economic development. This study bridges in-situ observations of pedestrian activity and urban computing by integrating high-resolution, large-scale, and heterogeneous urban datasets and analyzing both fixed attributes of the urban landscape (e.g. physical and transit infrastructure) with dynamic environmental and socio-psychological factors, such as weather, air quality, and perceived crime risk. We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial\u2013temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year. The results provide insights into the key drivers of local pedestrian activity and highlight the importance accounting for the immediate urban environment and socio-spatial dynamics in pedestrian behavior modeling. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Pedestrian mobility; Urban computing; Urban data; Urban planning; Walkability","Authors":"Lai Y., Kontokosta C.E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.018","Text":"Quantifying place: Analyzing the drivers of pedestrian activity in dense urban environments.

fundamental for urban planning and management of road traffic infrastructure. Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems are conventional methods for vehicle detection and travel times estimation. However, such systems are specifically focused on car plates, providing a limited extent of road users. The advance of open-source deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) in combination with freely-available closed-circuit television (CCTV) datasets have offered the opportunities for detection and classification of various road users. The research, presented here, aims to analyse traffic flow patterns through fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models on domain-specific low quality imagery, as captured in various weather conditions and seasons of the year 2018. Such imagery is collected from the North East Combined Authority (NECA) Travel and Transport Data, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Results show that the fine-tuned MobileNet model with 98.2% precision, 58.5% recall and 73.4% harmonic mean could potentially be used for a real time traffic monitoring application with big data, due to its fast performance. Compared to MobileNet, the fine-tuned Faster region proposal R-CNN model, providing a better harmonic mean (80.4%), recall (68.8%) and more accurate estimations of car units, could be used for traffic analysis applications that demand higher accuracy than speed. This research ultimately exploits machine learning alogrithms for a wider understanding of traffic congestion and disruption under social events and extreme weather conditions. \u00a9 Authors 2018.","Author Keywords":"CCTV big data; Computer vision; Infrastructure management; Machine learning; Tensorflow; Traffic monitoring","Authors":"Peppa M.V., Bell D., Komar T., Xiao W.","DOI":"10.5194\/isprs-archives-XLII-4-499-2018","Text":"Urban traffic flow analysis based on deep learning car detection from cctv image series.

for an effective urban planning as well as for enabling various context-aware service provisions to support mobility as a service (MaaS). Both applications rely on the sensor traces generated by travellers\u2019 smartphones. These traces can be used to interpret travel modes, both for generating automated travel diaries as well as for real-time travel mode detection. Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also, segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the location traces. In order to address all these challenges a novel, state based bottom-up approach is proposed. This approach assumes a fixed atomic segment of a homogeneous state, instead of an event-based segment, and a progressive iteration until a new state is found. The research investigates how an atomic state-based approach can be developed in such a way that can work in real time, near-real time and offline mode and in different environmental conditions with their varying quality of sensor traces. The results show the proposed bottom-up model outperforms the existing event-based segmentation models in terms of adaptivity, flexibility, accuracy and richness in information delivery pertinent to automated travel behavior interpretation. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Author Keywords":"Activity; Context; GPS; IMU; MaaS; Machine learning; Temporal calculi; Trajectory; Trip","Authors":"Das R.D., Winter S.","DOI":"10.3390\/s16111962","Text":"Automated urban travel interpretation: A bottom-up approach for trajectory segmentation.

environments represents a complex task for automated vehicles. They must reach their goal safely and efficiently while considering a multitude of traffic participants. We propose a modular decision making algorithm to autonomously navigate intersections, addressing challenges of existing rule-based and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. We first present a safe RL algorithm relying on a model-checker to ensure safety guarantees. To make the decision strategy robust to perception errors and occlusions, we introduce a belief update technique using a learning based approach. Finally, we use a scene decomposition approach to scale our algorithm to environments with multiple traffic participants. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms rule-based methods and reinforcement learning techniques on a complex intersection scenario. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Bouton M., Nakhaei A., Fujimura K., Kochenderfer M.J.","DOI":"10.1109\/IVS.2019.8813803","Text":"Safe reinforcement learning with scene decomposition for navigating complex urban environments.

To monitor the urban environment and facilitate the municipal administration, more and more applications adopt vehicles as participants to carry out MCS tasks. The performance of the applications highly depends on the sensing data which is influenced by the recruiting strategy on vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle selection algorithm to maximize the sensing range with limited cost while the vehicle selection problem was proved to be NP-complete.

source of information for deciding where to go and what to do. Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level. This opens up new opportunities for data-driven approaches to urban leisure and tourism studies. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"City planning; Knowledge extraction; Latent semantics; Multi-label classification; Place affordance; Urban space","Authors":"van Weerdenburg D., Scheider S., Adams B., Spierings B., van der Zee E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2018.09.005","Text":"Where to go and what to do: Extracting leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space.

recommending optimal police patrol strategies against opportunistic criminals in large scale urban problems. While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

Intelligent Transportation Systems combined with the increased availability of collected data allows the study of different methods for prevention of traffic congestion in cities. A common need in all of these methods is the use of traffic predictions for supporting planning and operation of the traffic lights and traffic management schemes. This paper focuses on comparing the forecasting effectiveness of three machine learning models, namely Random Forests, Support Vector Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron-in addition to Multiple Linear Regression-using probe data collected from the road network of Thessaloniki, Greece. The comparison was conducted with multiple tests clustered in three types of scenarios. The first scenario tests the algorithms on specific randomly selected dates on different randomly selected roads. The second scenario tests the algorithms on randomly selected roads over eight consecutive 15 min intervals; the third scenario tests the algorithms on random roads for the duration of a whole day. The experimental results show that while the Support Vector Regression model performs best at stable conditions with minor variations, the Multilayer Perceptron model adapts better to circumstances with greater variations, in addition to having the most near-zero errors. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Multiple linear regression; Neural networks; Random forest; SVR; Traffic prediction","Authors":"Bratsas C., Koupidis K., Salanova J.-M., Giannakopoulos K., Kaloudis A., Aifadopoulou G.","DOI":"10.3390\/SU12010142","Text":"A comparison of machine learning methods for the prediction of traffic speed in Urban places.

services begins to include real time traffic forecast features in order to compute more accurate routing along the journey, adaptive traffic control systems can also benefit from this prediction so as to minimize traffic congestion. But these two systems dedicated to end user and road traffic management authorities could also benefits from other information, and particularly from parking availability prediction since cruising for parking spot represents a significant part of urban traffic: When looking for a parking, drivers must guess where to go, and if they are wrong, may face long distances to find the next location, resulting in considerable time loss and a worsening of traffic congestion. We focus on the simultaneous prediction of traffic and parking availability. Our approach relay on machine learning techniques and more precisely on representation learning methods: Each road and car-park is represented by a vector in a common large dimensional space which captures both structural and dynamical information about the observed phenomenon. Such a model is thus able to jointly capture the spatio-Temporal correlations between parking and traffic resulting in a high performance prediction system. The results of our experiments on the Grand Lyon (France) urban area show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state of the art methods. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Ziat A., Leroy B., Baskiotis N., Denoyer L.","DOI":"10.1109\/ITSC.2016.7795634","Text":"Joint prediction of road-Traffic and parking occupancy over a city with representation learning.

development of mobile Internet techniques, using the sensor-rich smartphones to sense various contexts attracts much attention, such as transportation mode recognition. The transportation mode information can help to improve urban planning, traffic management and journey planning. Though much work has been done on the transportation mode recognition using classic machine learning algorithms, the performance of these methods is not reasonable and heavily relies on the effectiveness of handcrafted features. In this paper, we leverage the strong representation ability of deep learning method and present a deep-learning-based algorithm for transportation mode recognition, namely CL-TRANSMODE, which is capable of accurately detecting multiple transportation modes. The algorithm first uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn appropriate and robust feature representations for transportation modes recognition. Then, an LSTM network performs a further learning of the temporal dependencies characteristics on the feature vectors of CNN output. To further enhance the accuracy of transportation mode recognition, several artificial segments and peak features are extracted from the raw sensor measurements. These features characterize the transportation modes over a much long period of time (minutes or hours). By combining the CNN-extracted features and handcrafted features, our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm can accurately differentiate eight transportation modes, i.e., walking, running, bicycling, driving a car, riding a bus, taking a metro, taking a train, or being stationary. Extensive experiments on both the SHL and HTC datasets demonstrate that use our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative algorithms.

with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities\u2019 evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation's companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers\u2019 companies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"ISO 37120; Machine learning; Smart City services; Text Classification; Topic Classification","Authors":"Bencke L., Cechinel C., Munoz R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.future.2020.03.057","Text":"Automated classification of social network messages into Smart Cities dimensions.

expansion of mobile phone networks in developing countries, large-scale graph machine learning has gained sudden relevance in the study of global poverty. Recent applications range from humanitarian response and poverty estimation to urban planning and epidemic containment.

In this paper, we develop a graph-based convolutional network for learning on multi-view networks. We show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms on three different prediction tasks using mobile phone datasets from three different developing countries.

from the trajectory data generated by GPS devices, which can be reflected in different transportation modes and provide useful information for trajectory prediction, urban planning and traffic monitoring. In this article, we proposed transportation modes classification method based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to discover seven kinds of transportation modes from GPS trajectory data, including walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a taxi, driving a car, taking the subway and taking a train. First, the original trajectories must be divided into some sub trajectories. There is only one transportation mode label in each sub trajectory. Second, the feature vector of sub trajectory is computed including eight basic and three advanced features. These basic features are distance feature, five velocity-related features and two acceleration-related features. Three advanced features are heading change rate (hcr), stop rate (sr) and velocity change rate (vcr), Final, the LightGBM classifier is used to detect the transportation modes automatically. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and decision tree are also used to verify the efficiency of our method. The experiment data are Geolife provided by Microsoft Research Asia. The results show that the LightGBM and XGBoost methods are more accurate than decision tree method and the LightGBM is better than XGBoost at the classification of car, subway and train. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"GPS; LighGBM; Machine learning; Trajectory data; Transportation mode","Authors":"Wang B., Wang Y., Qin K., Xia Q.","DOI":"10.1109\/GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8557149","Text":"Detecting Transportation Modes Based on LightGBM Classifier from GPS Trajectory Data.

available mobile phone data is providing unprecedented direct measurements of human behavior. Early recognition and prediction of behavioral patterns are of great importance in many societal applications like urban planning, transportation optimization, and health-care. Understanding the relationships between human behaviors and location\u2019s context is an emerging interest for understanding human-environmental dynamics. Growing availability of Web 2.0, i.e. the increasing amount of websites with mainly user created content and social platforms opens up an opportunity to study such location\u2019s contexts. This paper investigates relationships existing between human behavior and location context, by analyzing log mobile phone data records. First an advanced approach to categorize areas in a city based on the presence and distribution of categories of human activity (e.g., eating, working, and shopping) found across the areas, is proposed. The proposed classification is then evaluated through its comparison with the patterns of temporal variation of mobile phone activity and applying machine learning techniques to predict a timeline type of communication activity in a given location based on the knowledge of the obtained category vs. land-use type of the locations areas. The proposed classification turns out to be more consistent with the temporal variation of human communication activity, being a better predictor for those compared to the official land use classification. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2016.","Author Keywords":"Big data; Cell phone data records; Clustering algorithms; Geospatial data; Human activity recognition; Human behavior; Knowledge management; Land-use; Supervised learning algorithms","Authors":"Dashdorj Z., Sobolevsky S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-662-53416-8_10","Text":"Characterization of behavioral patterns exploiting description of geographical areas.

social function of areas of interest (AOIs) is crucial to the identification of urban functional zoning and land use classification, which has been a hot topic in various fields such as urban planning and smart city fields. Most existing studies on urban functional zoning and land use classification either largely rely on low-frequency remote sensing images, which are constrained to the block level due to their spatial scale limitation, or suffer from low accuracy and high uncertainty when using dynamic data, such as social media and traffic data. This paper proposes an hour-day-spectrum (HDS) approach for generating six types of distribution waveforms of taxi pick-up and drop-off points which serve as interpretation indicators of the social functions of AOIs. To achieve this goal, we first performed fine-grained cleaning of the drop-off points to eliminate the spatial errors caused by taxi drivers. Next, buffer and spatial clustering were integrated to explore the associations between travel behavior and AOIs. Third, the identification of AOI types was made by using the standard HDS method combined with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Finally, some matching tests were carried out by similarity indexes of a standard HDS and sample HDS, i.e., the Gaussian kernel function and Pearson coefficient, to ensure matching accuracy. The experiment was conducted in the Chongchuan and Gangzha Districts, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. By training 50 AOI samples, six types of standard HDS of residential districts, schools, hospitals, and shopping malls were obtained. Then, 108 AOI samples were tested, and the overall accuracy was found to be 90.74%. This approach generates value-added services of the taxi trajectory and provides a continuous update and fine-grained supplementary method for the identification of land use types. In addition, the approach is object-oriented and based on AOIs, and can be combined with image interpretation and other methods to improve the identification effect. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"AOI; Land use type; Machine learning; Social function; Urban functional zoning","Authors":"Zhou T., Liu X., Qian Z., Chen H., Tao F.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi9010007","Text":"Automatic identification of the social functions of areas of interest (AOIS) using the standard hour-day-spectrum approach.

management of sustainable urban systems hinges on the community embracing these systems. Capturing citizens\u2019 ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics\/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens\u2019 inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs\/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered\/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth\/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views.

routing and path planning algorithms and relied only on static characteristics of the roads like the number of lanes, distance and speed limits to avoid and resolve traffic congestion, by routing traffic to a lighter traffic path. However, with the increased number of vehicles in urban areas these algorithms may have reached their limitation due to the huge increase in the state space in a limited computing power and memory environment. In this research we will introduce a dynamic routing system for traffic in intersections based on real-time traffic conditions such as individual vehicle speed, destination and traffic light status to provide the fasted path between a source and a target point. This system will exploit the recent advancements in the field of machine learning by leveraging the power of deep learning especially deep convolutional neural networks. Simulation shows that the proposed model results in a path that are generally fast and avoids frequent red light stops. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"deep learning; path planning; traffic congestion; Traffic control; traffic routing","Authors":"Lamouik I., Yahyaouy A., Sabri M.A.","DOI":"10.1109\/ISACV.2018.8354012","Text":"Deep neural network dynamic traffic routing system for vehicles.

Getting accurate routing instructions, finding parking spots, receiving customized information that helps individual drivers reach their destination will significantly reduce the stress of driving, save fuel and reduce unnecessary delays and pollution levels. In this paper we present a system that combines smart navigation with intelligent parking assist and driver diagnostics to considerably improve driving comfort, safety and mobility in an urban environment. The smart navigation employs an on line traffic simulator which provides traffic predictions and improves the accuracy of existing navigation systems which rely on limited traffic data. The intelligent parking assist system predicts the availability of parking at the start of the journey and these predictions get updated as the destination is approached. The system uses machine learning to understand the habits and preferences of the individual driver so that the preferred parking availability information is presented to the driver. The driver diagnostics part learns the driving characteristics of the driver i.e. whether aggressive, semi aggressive or passive, reaction times, following distances etc. and provides this information to the smart navigation and parking assist system for better estimation of travel times. In addition, it can be used to support collision warnings and other driver assist devices. The proposed system has been successfully demonstrated using an AUDI vehicle in the area of Los Angeles and San Francisco. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"driver diagnostics; parking assistance; smart navigation; traffic flow prediction; urban traffic","Authors":"Ioannou P., Zhang Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/DMIAF.2016.7574917","Text":"Intelligent driver assist system for urban driving.

urban regeneration planning involves fulfilment of complex design objectives that require a close collaboration between stakeholders, designers and planners. The objectives are to achieve computationally optimized design plans that are environmentally robust and sustainable. For the purpose of pre-planning analysis and optimization of such design models, the construction framework of the whole system development life cycle is simulated using specialist analysis tools. In the analysis and design phase of such a construction process, location allocation of built environment structures integrated with AI based urban assessment models remain a cumbersome task. With the advent of sophisticated computing hardware and 3D modelling techniques, it has become viable to visualize and develop simulation outcomes with ease over standard computers. However, creation of simulated outcomes with huge urban details still remains a daunting task. With the advent of knowledge-based data standards and mining techniques, possibilities have arisen to integrate procedural urban modelling frameworks with socio-economic deprivation assessment systems to create massive city models in order to improve sustainability and smart growth. The implementation of a procedural modelling framework offers a promising area of research in location allocation optimization of residential and public service structures for urban regeneration planning and collaboration purposes but is still largely stochastic in nature until now. The work presented in this article proposes an L-system-based automated urban layout generation module in addition to an evolutionary building placement optimization system for the purpose of urban regeneration decision support. The location allocation optimization of a highly accessible pedestrian and street network grid still remains a complex process especially with neighbourhoods suffering from severe socio-economic deprivation. Using an extension to 'L-systems', the module utilizes an 'mBPMOL' system to recursively subdivide an urban regeneration layout and later encode the layout to a genetic chromosome to iteratively place a range of urban structures to the lots. Moving further, the system implements a distance-based socio-economic deprivation minimization fitness function and assesses subsequent individual genetic solutions to search for an optimized layout. The development of such an online procedural framework is a very first attempt to employ the capabilities of procedural automation with evolutionary computation to automatically generate and optimize the placement of a large number of building models. The outcome achieved a set of relatively optimal solutions with evaluation based upon a distance-based fitness objective function of various public service structures. The solutions (layout plans) thus obtained offered a number of moderate to highly accessible alternatives. Development of such a system is meant to facilitate decision support and improve time efficiency among urban designers and planners. \u00a9 2011 The authors.","Author Keywords":"Artificial Intelligence; Built Environment; Genetic Algorithms; Urban Planning; Urban Regeneration","Authors":"Yusuf S.A., Georgakis P., Nwagboso C.","DOI":null,"Text":"Procedural lot generation for evolutionary urban layout optimization in urban regeneration decision support.

flow prediction is an important basis of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) such as transportation operations and urban planning applications. However, due to the lack of complete directly measured data on urban traffic flow, existing studies cannot adequately mine the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations characterizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Electronic registration identification (ERI), which is an emerging technology for uniquely identifying a vehicle, can help collect the travel records of all vehicles. This inspires us to employ ERI big data for traffic flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spatial-temporal feature optimization method with ERI big data for short-term traffic flow prediction based on a gradient\u2013boosted regression tree, called DSTO-GBRT. Firstly, the framework of DSTO-GBRT is built. Secondly, we analyze the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations among the current prediction point and upstream correlative points using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Thirdly, to eliminate the linear correlations among features, we exploit principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the original training data and obtain optimized training data. In the experiment, real-world ERI big data from Chongqing are employed for the proposed DSTO-GBRT method. Compared with ST-GBRT, ARIMA, DSTO-BPNN and DSTO-SVM, the results demonstrate that DSTO-GBRT can provide timely and adaptive prediction even in rush hour, when traffic conditions change rapidly. Furthermore, compared with DSO-GBRT and DTO-GBRT, the results show that the proposed DSTO-GBRT method is more accurate. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Dynamic spatial-temporal feature; ERI big data; Gradient-boosted regression tree; Principal component analysis; Traffic flow prediction","Authors":"Zheng L., Yang J., Chen L., Sun D., Liu W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.neucom.2020.05.038","Text":"Dynamic spatial-temporal feature optimization with ERI big data for Short-term traffic flow prediction.

learning in combination with an optimization heuristic algorithm such as a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Further, we developed a knowledge-based algorithm for a knowledge learning system. The algorithm learns to classify coordinates (unlabeled) into regions. Consequently, dividing routing calculations into regions (clusters) provides many benefits over traditional methods, and can result in an improvement in routing cost over the traditional company method by up to 25.68% and over the classical GA by up to 8.10%. It is also shown that our proposed method can reduce traveling distance compared to previous methods. Finally, the prediction of future customer regions has an accuracy of up to 0.72 for the predicted unlabeled customer coordinates.

population is not only directly related with increased urban mobility but also traffic delays, losses in fuel, air and noise pollution as well as physiological and psychological problems in the population. Traffic control has been shown to be a means of maintaining road serviceability with a key input being traffic inference. The harvesting of sufficiently large data sets for traffic inference has thus far been a challenge examined by the scientific community. A modelling, interactive design approach to the harvesting and preprocessing of vehicular data can be used to bridge the gap for traffic control to be autonomously implementable in an urban context. With this consideration, this paper explores the implementation of an internet of things multiagent system, in a network and equipped with sensors, distributed along the roadway to collect and share this vehicular data among its nodes and then process the data using a machine learning algorithm for learning and subsequent inference of vehicular types. An interactive design approach is used in the creation of a reduced model of knowledge from each node\u2019s bulk harvested data, which is then easily stored or deployed and which also facilitates post-processing of data. Considering the smart city as a product, the interactive approach to product engineering permits the implementation of these mathematical models as part of an interactive traffic control system, to ensure the city\u2019s adaptability to the ever-changing needs of its inhabitants. In this paper, we present the analysis of the trivial case of the detection of presence and absence of a class A type vehicle. In the introductory section, we examine the problem of transportation in urban expansion. In section two, we examine the solution provided by the Smart Cities with respect to transport services. Further problems which appear within these transport services and their respective solutions in machine learning and the internet of things are discussed in this section on these disruptive technologies. Section three examines the bibliography for successes achieved with similar research and also demonstrates the basis for classification by support vector machines. Sections four to six explain how the experiment is set up to test the hypothesis that over 99% accuracy in vehicular detection can be achieved with the proposed system when cross-referenced with the actual acoustic, magnetic and video presence and absence of a test vehicle. \u00a9 2017, Springer-Verlag France.","Author Keywords":"Big data; Intelligent traffic systems; Internet of things; Machine learning; Smart cities","Authors":"Reid A.R., P\u00e9rez C.R.C., Rodr\u00edguez D.M.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12008-017-0404-1","Text":"Inference of vehicular traffic in smart cities using machine learning with the internet of things.

of cities has long been studied in urban planning and traffic modeling. This study presents a reliable method that reveals the structure of cities mainly based on clustering analysis using a new similarity measure. Several previous studies have used well-known clustering algorithms in machine learning fields, such as k-means clustering based on temporal mobility patterns of regions, whereas other studies have applied community detection algorithms on networks that depict traffic flows. However, the former does not reflect spatial interactions among places or areas, and the latter groups' places or areas with different land uses into the same cluster. To address these issues in existing approaches, this study proposes a new similarity method that considers not only temporal mobility patterns of areas but also spatial interactions with other areas. Moreover, the study combines spectral clustering repeated several times with hierarchical clustering to obtain a reliable structure that keeps the contiguity of clusters and determine the hierarchy of different areal units. The application of the proposed method to the data for Seoul, South Korea, reveals that the proposed clustering process divides a city into relatively homogeneous areas in terms of land uses. The flow maps based on the clustering results also revealed the spatial interactions between different areas and identify the polycentric structure of Seoul. \u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"city structure; clustering analysis; data mining; public transportation; Smart cards","Authors":"Kim K.","DOI":"10.1109\/TITS.2019.2910548","Text":"Identifying the Structure of Cities by Clustering Using a New Similarity Measure Based on Smart Card Data.

In this paper a Bow Tie (BT) framework model has been created to combine BDA into the risk assessment process. The BDA can be beneficial to the risk assessment, support the decision makers in real time, and reduce human errors.

essential to mitigate different challenges and meet the required quality of communications. However, most of the available clustering protocols were designed for highways, and thus become unstable in realistic urban environments with many intersections. In this paper, a Clustering Adaptation Near Intersection (CANI) approach is proposed to ensure clustering stability at intersections. This approach exploits Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) to predict the behavior of the vehicles near an intersection and adapt the clusters accordingly. The main advantage of the developed OS-ELM prediction model is its ability to continuously learn and update in real time. After being validated, the proposed adaptation approach is included in a highway clustering scheme. The resultant clustering protocol is compared to other schemes in a realistic urban environment, and shows significant stability and efficiency performance improvement. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Clustering algorithm; Machine learning; Urban environment; VANET","Authors":"Alsuhli G.H., Khattab A., Fahmy Y.A., Massoud Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICVES.2019.8906296","Text":"Enhanced urban clustering in VANETs using online machine learning.

Allocation","Abstract":"Self-driving cars are becoming popular topics in academia. Consumers of self-driving cars and vehicles have different concerns, for example, safety and security, to name a few. Also, the public sector has interests in self-driving cars such as amending policies to enable the management of self-driving vehicles in cities, urban planning, traffic management and, etc. In this paper, more than 2700 corpus are extracted from literature from several subject areas to identify latent (hidden) topics of self-driving cars. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used for topic identification. The result of this study shows that topics identified are valid research areas such as urban planning, driver car (computer) interaction, self-driving control and system design, ethics in self-driving cars, safety and risk assessment, training dataset quality and machine learning in self-driving cars are among the topics identified. Furthermore, the network visualization of association graph of terms shows that the most frequently discussed concepts reveal that control of self-driving cars is based on algorithms, data, design, method, and model. The methods used in this study and the results can be used as decision tools, if carefully applied, in diverse disciplines that are disrupted by the introduction of self-driving cars. For future study, we plan to extend this study with a larger dataset and other data mining techniques. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"self-driving cars; topic modeling; unsupervised topic modeling; unveiling hidden topics","Authors":"Ayele W.Y., Juell-Skielse G.","DOI":"10.1109\/IEMCON.2018.8615056","Text":"Unveiling Topics from Scientific Literature on the Subject of Self-driving Cars using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

smartphones and inbuilt sensors, the day-to-day spatiotemporal activities of people can be recorded. With this available information, the automated extraction of spatiotemporal patterns is crucial to understand the people\u2019s mobility. These patterns can assist in improving the smart city environments like traffic control, urban planning, and transportation facilities. The smartphone generated spatiotemporal data is enriched with multiple contexts and efficiently utilizing them in a Machine Learning process is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a Nonnegative Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (CMTF) model to integrate and analyze additional contexts with spatiotemporal data to generate meaningful patterns. We also propose an efficient factorization algorithm based on variable selection to solve the Nonnegative CMTF model that yields accurate spatiotemporal patterns. Our empirical analysis highlights the efficiency of the proposed CMTF model in terms of accuracy and factor goodness. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Author Keywords":"Greedy coordinate descent; Nonnegative coupled matrix tensor factorization; Pattern mining; Smart city; Spatiotemporal; Variable selection","Authors":"Balasubramaniam T., Nayak R., Yuen C.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-13709-0_44","Text":"Nonnegative coupled matrix tensor factorization for smart city spatiotemporal pattern mining.

the term \u2018big data\u2019 has contributed to recent advances in computational analysis techniques, such as machine learning and more broadly, artificial intelligence, which can extract patterns from large, multi-dimensional datasets. In the field of urban planning, it is pertinent to understand both how such techniques can advance our understanding of cities, and how they can be embedded within transparent and effective digital planning tools, known as planning support systems. This research specifically focuses on two related contributions. First, it investigates the role of planning support systems in supporting a participatory data analytics approach through an iterative process of developing and evaluating a planning support system environment. Second, it investigates how specifically machine learning planning support systems can be co-designed by built environment practitioners and stakeholders in this environment to solve a real planning issue in Sydney, Australia. This paper presents the results of applied research undertaken through the design and implementation of four workshops, involving 57 participants who were involved in a co-design process. The research follows a mixed-methods approach, studying a wide array of measures related to participatory analytics, task load, perceived added value, recordings and observations. The results highlight recommendations regarding the design and evaluation of planning support system environments for co-design and their coupling with machine learning techniques. It was found that consistency and transparency are highly valued and central to the design of a planning support system in this context. General attitudes towards machine learning and artificial intelligence as techniques for planners and developers were positive, as they were seen as both potentially transformative but also as simply another technique to assist with workflows. Some conceptual challenges were encountered driven by practitioners' simultaneous need for concrete scenarios for accurate predictions, paired with a desire for predictions to drive the development of these scenarios. Insights from this work can inform future planning support system evaluation and co-design studies, in particular those aiming to support democracy enhancement, greater inclusion and more efficient resource allocation through a participatory analytics approach. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","Author Keywords":"co-design; Machine learning; mixed methods; planning support systems; urban development","Authors":"Lock O., Bain M., Pettit C.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808320939974","Text":"Towards the collaborative development of machine learning techniques in planning support systems \u2013 a Sydney example.

attach much attention to the selection of commercial locations. With the rapid development of urban data and machine learning, we can discover the patterns of human mobility with these data and technology to guide commercial district discovery. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised commercial district discovery framework via embedding space clustering on graph convolution networks (GCN2CDD) to solve the problem of commercial district discovery. Specifically, the proposed framework aggregates human mobility features according to geographic similarity by graph convolution networks. Based on the graph convolution networks embedding space, we apply hierarchical clustering to mine the latent functional regions hidden in different human patterns. Then with the kernel density estimation, we can obtain the semantic labels for the clustering results to discover commercial districts. Finally, we analyze the multi-sources data of the Xiaoshan District and Chengdu City and experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework.

Computing","Abstract":"In recent years, the urbanization process has brought modernity while also causing key issues, such as traffic congestion and parking conflicts. Therefore, cities need a more intelligent \"brain\" to form more intelligent and efficient transportation systems. At present, as a type of machine learning, the traditional clustering algorithm still has limitations. K-means algorithm is widely used to solve traffic clustering problems, but it has limitations, such as sensitivity to initial points and poor robustness. Therefore, based on the hybrid architecture of Quantum Annealing (QA) and brain-inspired cognitive computing, this study proposes QA and Brain-Inspired Clustering Algorithm (QABICA) to solve the problem of urban taxi-stand locations. Based on the traffic trajectory data of Xi'an and Chengdu provided by Didi Chuxing, the clustering results of our algorithm and K-means algorithm are compared. We find that the average taxi-stand location bias of the final result based on QABICA is smaller than that based on K-means, and the bias of our algorithm can effectively reduce the tradition K-means bias by approximately 42%, up to approximately 83%, with higher robustness. QA algorithm is able to jump out of the local suboptimal solutions and approach the global optimum, and brain-inspired cognitive computing provides search feedback and direction. Thus, we will further consider applying our algorithm to analyze urban traffic flow, and solve traffic congestion and other key problems in intelligent transportation. \u00a9 2020 Tsinghua University Press.

The lack of reliable models for understanding and predicting mobility needs during urban events causes issues for mobility service users, providers as well as urban planners. In this article, we tackle the problem of building reliable supervised models for predicting the spatial and temporal impact of planned special events with respect to road traffic.

Our evaluation results on real-world event data containing events from several venues in the Hannover region in Germany demonstrate that the proposed combinations of event-, mobility- and infrastructure-related features show the best performance and are able to accurately predict spatial and temporal impact on road traffic in the event context in this region.

land-use information is critical for urban planning and public policy development. However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geocontextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. To enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation, a multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions, forcing the embeddings to encapsulate effective representation for flow prediction. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model using real-world dataset from New York City and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against the state of the art.

major problems in constantly growing cities, and the expansion and modernization of the traffic system are a major priority to all government infrastructures. In effect, more efficient traffic represents a more efficient economy. Solving the issue of congestion by increasing the number of roads is not always the most cost-effective solution as it represents massive changes in city infrastructures that have been present for decades. Urban planning shapes the environment around us but fails to address specifically the future traffic clogging. Our research tackles the problem of traffic congestion by proposing a system for vehicle detection, identification, and count, allied with reinforcement learning for traffic congestion anticipation and prediction. The need for a real-time and efficient system led us to push the research and development onto an Edge Computing platform using IoT and secure transactions using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Blockchain intervenes as a security protocol in the proposed system. The native form of Internet of Things does not include security protocols which are important to a large scale implementation. Ensuring the security of transactions and permanent access control is the main reason why blockchain is rooted in our system architecture. Our project aims to reduce the traffic load on roads experiencing significant congestion, and improve overall city traffic system without costly investment into new communication infrastructures and city planning. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Author Keywords":"Blockchain; Containerization; Edge computing; Hyperledger fabric; Machine learning; Traffic congestion","Authors":"Tiba K., Parizi R.M., Zhang Q., Dehghantanha A., Karimipour H., Choo K.-K.R.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-38181-3_6","Text":"Secure blockchain-based traffic load balancing using edge computing and reinforcement learning.

predictions of the next destination and estimated time of arrival (ETA) are of paramount importance for efficient resource planning of delivery fleets and for providing a satisfactory client experience. The quality of prediction is limited by the information accessible to individual logistics business entities, and further complicated by the complex urban road system. Data collection under the auspices of smart city initiatives worldwide provides exciting new opportunities to overcome these limitations. In this study, the authors identify two areas of improvement through data-driven approaches, including a next destination predictor, based on the delivery fleet's historical global positioning system trajectory data using a non-linear autoregressive neural network, and a road incident detector for real-time ETA improvement. By comparing a range of machine learning classification algorithms for incident detection, XGBoost has been found to be the most practical choice, due to its performance and efficiency. The proposed framework can be utilised by government authorities who possess such data for better urban planning and providing advanced infrastructure, so as to improve the operational efficiency of the logistics industry. \u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Zhao B., Teo Y.S., Ng W.S., Ng H.H.","DOI":"10.1049\/iet-its.2019.0148","Text":"Data-driven next destination prediction and ETA improvement for urban delivery fleets.

Investment on planning and processing of traffic information should help to minimize congestion and pollution.

Inorder to make the roads safer artificial intelligence-based security cameras hoping to achieve automated recognition of people and events is planned. Digital brains map the eyes to analyze live video and helping responders to more easily find crimes and accidents on roads. Machine learning is employed to get considerable gains in its ability to identify objects, the skill of analyzing scenes, activities, and movements.

for the evaluation of performance measures as a decision support system (DSS) with a focus on urban aesthetics evaluation. This framework allows designers to address performance measures, urban measures and aesthetic criteria in an adaptive, interactive generative design approach. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the structure and the nature of the framework and the application of human-in-the-loop design systems to urban design. Design\/methodology\/approach: Significant literature reviewed lead to the identification of an application potential in the decision-making process. This potential is situated around the use of AI for the evaluation of subjective performance criteria in a DSS. Recognising that the key decisions about urban aesthetics are based on the individual evaluation of the designer, an HITL approach for computational design software to support creative decisions is presented in this paper. Findings: Urban typogenetics for interactive generative urban design allows the exploration of complex design spaces by using a human-in-the-loop design system in the context of urban aesthetics. Hybrid aesthetic evaluation allows the designer to analyse morphological features and urban aesthetics during exploratory search and reveal hidden aspects of the urban context by visualisation of the results of the aesthetic evaluation. Integrating performance measures and urban aesthetics in urban typogenetics addresses major criteria of urban design at the beginning of the creative process. Originality\/value: The use of a broad interactive approach to typogenetic design in an application to urban scenarios is a novel conceptual approach to the design of urban configurations. The suggested adaptive mechanism would allow the user of a typogenetic tool to subjectively evaluate solutions by sight and reason about aesthetic, social and cultural implication of the reviewed design solutions. \u00a9 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Early design stages; Evolutionary urbanism; Exploratory search; Generative design; Typogenetic design; Urban aesthetics","Authors":"Muehlbauer M.","DOI":"10.1108\/SASBE-10-2017-0052","Text":"Towards typogenetic tools for generative urban aesthetics.

human mobility can be exploited to support the design of traffic planning, route recommendations, urban planning, emergency management, and land use. Currently, various methods such as the machine learning algorithms, statistical methods, and semantic analysis are widely applied to identify and extract human mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a simple and generic paradigm for mining human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data using complex network analysis. The essential ideas behind the proposed paradigm mainly include (1) creating weighted complex networks of GPS trajectories and (2) extracting the human mobility patterns by analyzing the structures and metrics of the created complex networks of GPS trajectories. To evaluate the performance of the proposed paradigm, we design five groups of experiments and identify the mobility patterns of the selected five persons based on the selected five network analysis metrics. Experimental results indicate that (1) the proposed paradigm is effective and (2) the quite interesting potential information about the human mobility can be mined easily. The proposed paradigm is simple and generic, which can be employed to rapidly identify the human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data. \u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Author Keywords":"complex network analysis; data mining; GPS trajectory; human mobility","Authors":"Wang S., Mei G., Cuomo S.","DOI":"10.1002\/cpe.5335","Text":"A generic paradigm for mining human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data using complex network analysis.

summary of a quick overview of the latest developments and unprecedented opportunities for scholars who want to set foot in the field of traditional taxi and online car-hailing (TTOC). From the perspectives of peoples (e.g., passenger, driver, and policymaker), vehicle, road, and environment, this paper describes the current research status of TTOC's big data in six hot topics, including the ridership factor, spatio-temporal distribution and travel behavior, cruising strategy and passenger service market partition, route planning, transportation emission and new-energy, and TTOC's data extensional application. These topics were included in five mainstreams as follows: (1) abundant studies often focus only on determinant analysis on given transportation (taxi, transit, online car-hailing); the exploration of ridership patterns for a multi-modal transportation mode is rare; furthermore, multiple aspects of factors were not considered synchronously in a wide time span; (2) travel behavior research mainly concentrates on the commuting trips and distribution patterns of various travel indices (e.g., distance, displacement, time); (3) the taxi driver-searching strategy can be divided into autopsychic cruising and system dispatching; (4) the spatio-temporal distribution character of TTOC's fuel consumption (FC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a hotspot recently, and there has been a recommendation for electric taxi (ET) in urban cities to decrease transportation congestion is proposed; and (5) based on TTOC and point of interest (POI) multi-source data, many machine learning algorithms were used to predict travel condition indices, land use, and travel behavior.

systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science.

This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole \u2018forest\u2019 of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

important role in modern cities for city planning, navigation, and other mobility services. Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Deep Learning; LSTM; Machine Learning; POI; Urban Mobility Prediction","Authors":"Askari B., Le Quy T., Ntoutsi E.","DOI":"10.1109\/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7","Text":"Taxi Demand Prediction using an LSTM-Based Deep Sequence Model and Points of Interest.

approaches","Abstract":"Ride-sourcing services are getting more popular each year, and their markets are growing. Much has been speculated, but not much has been tested regarding the impacts of ride-sourcing services on the transportation system. In this study, we examine the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership of households, by using the most up-to-date (2017) national household travel survey data. To better capture the effect of ride-sourcing services on vehicle ownership, we controlled for the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of households and built environment variables, i.e., density, diversity, design, and distance to transit. Two approaches were used to model vehicle ownership: a probabilistic or inferential model (i.e., multilevel Poisson), and a machine learning method (i.e., random forest). This is the first study to utilize such advanced methods to model vehicle ownership and capture non-linear relationships, using the largest sample of household travel records ever assembled for such a study. The results suggest that there is a negative correlation between using ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership. Vehicle ownership is also negatively associated with the number of years Uber, as the biggest ride-sourcing service, has operated in a county. The relative contributions of ride-sourcing variables, however, are very limited compared to other variables controlled in this study which makes intuitive sense. For urban planning and design practices, this study suggests that the probability of car shedding will increase if the usage of ride-sourcing services becomes a habit, these services become more available, and built environments become more dense, connected, and transit-served. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Multilevel modeling; Random forest; Ride-sourcing services; Uber; Vehicle ownership","Authors":"Sabouri S., Brewer S., Ewing R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2020.103797","Text":"Exploring the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership, using both inferential and machine learning approaches.

revolution 4.0, the use of IoT-based systems is increasing, both in the field of health manufacturing, urban planning, housing, and even automotive. Therefore, the security of the IoT system needs to be considered, this is related to data integrity, privacy, service stability. Through intrusion detection, activities on the IoT system will be able to be analyzed whether there are suspicious activities that can interfere with or threaten IoT services. In several previous studies in the literature, the approach used to detect intrusions in the IoT system has a high false alarm rate. This research proposes an approach through machine learning, specifically the ensemble learning approach and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) method as a method of detecting intrusions in the IoT system which is expected to produce better performance. The results of this study indicate that the proposed approach is able to detect intrusion and classify into five types of intrusion including normal intrusion, probe, dos, r2l, u2r. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed approach can improve the performance of intrusion detection in terms of accuracy to 97.02%, detection rate of 97%, false alarm rate 0.16%, compared to base learning and approaches in previous studies used as intrusion detection methods, but in processing time performance have not shown satisfying results. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Audit; Ensemble learning; Intrusion Detection; IoT; Machine learning","Authors":"Kurniawan A.A., Santoso H.A., Soeleman M.A., Fanani A.Z.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICSITech46713.2019.8987524","Text":"Intrusion Detection System as Audit in IoT Infrastructure using Ensemble Learning and SMOTE Method.

regions that support particular functionalities in an urban setting has been approached in literature using two general methodologies: top-down, encoding expert knowledge on urban planning and design and discovering regions that conform to that knowledge; and bottom-up, using data to train machine learning models, which can discover similar regions. Both methodologies face limitations, with knowledge-based approaches being criticized for scalability and transferability issues and data-driven approaches for lacking interpretability and depending heavily on data quality. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework that fuses a knowledge-based approach using design patterns and a data-driven approach using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in three different ways: Functional regions discovered using either approach are evaluated against each other to identify cases of significant agreement or disagreement; knowledge from patterns is used to adjust topic probabilities in the learning model; and topic probabilities are used to adjust pattern-based results. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated through the use case of identifying shopping-related regions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results show that the combination of pattern-based discovery and topic modeling extraction helps uncover discrepancies between the two approaches and smooth inaccuracies caused by the limitations of each approach. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Functional region; Patterns; Place; Topic modeling; Urban planning; Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)","Authors":"Papadakis E., Gao S., Baryannis G.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi8090385","Text":"Combining design patterns and topic modeling to discover regions that support particular functionality.

population distribution plays a key role in urban planning, emergency management and public travel information services. Currently, the widespread use of mobile phone data provides the opportunity to support fine-scale population studies. However, the data sparsity problem of mobile phone data has been a huge handicap. To overcome this, we proposed a comprehensive approach to achieve fine-grained dynamic population distribution and high-resolution population map based on large-scale sparse mobile phone data. First, we developed an anchor-point-based trajectory reconstruction method to improve the spatiotemporal granularity of mobile phone trajectories. Then, a rapid and efficient automation population mapping method was proposed with the support of reconstructed high spatiotemporal resolution of human movements. Finally, we analyze spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution and spatial-Temporal interaction of human movement. Using a real mobile phone dataset in the city of Shanghai as a case study, we evaluated the performance of our method. Results indicated that our method improved the precision and reliability of population distribution estimation and could be utilized for quantitatively analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution and migration. We argue that this study is useful for understanding the highly dynamic human movement states and supporting advanced urban applications. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"dynamic population distribution; Machine learning; Mobile phone data; Trajectory reconstruction","Authors":"Li M., Zhang H., Chen J.","DOI":"10.1109\/MDM.2019.00008","Text":"Fine-grained dynamic population mapping method based on large-scale sparse mobile phone data.

understanding the relationship between human mobility and socioeconomic status is critical to public policies formulation, urban design and marketing strategies development. Based on the available massive geo-located human data, existing studies focused almost exclusively on the position attributes (i.e. coordinates) of the locations visited by people to explore the relationship, however, they ignored the category attributes (e.g. restaurant or supermarket) of these locations which imply the purposes (e.g. eating or shopping) behind human movements. A location with coordinates and category information is usually referred to as a point-of-interest (POI). In this paper, we study the relationship between POIs-related human mobility and socioeconomic status at city level. Starting from the location-based social network (i.e. Foursquare) dataset, we find that the check-in numbers of location categories are correlated with socioeconomic indicators, either positively or negatively. To further validate these correlations, we develop and test a multi-task prediction framework based on POIs-related human mobility for forecasting socioeconomic indicators. Extensive experiments on the Foursquare dataset show that the socioeconomic indicators can be well predicted by our proposed framework. Our findings and methods are helpful for modeling human mobility and assessing socioeconomic status. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Big data; Human mobility; Machine learning; Prediction; Urban socioeconomic","Authors":"Li D., Liu J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.tele.2019.01.001","Text":"Uncovering the relationship between point-of-interests-related human mobility and socioeconomic status.

various urban tasks. A frequently used approach is to treat each region as a data sample and build a model over all the regions to observe the correlations between urban features (e.g., demographics) and the target variable (e.g., crime count). To define regions, most existing studies use fixed grids or pre-defined administrative boundaries (e.g., census tracts or community areas). In reality, however, definitions of regions should be different depending on tasks (e.g., regional crime count prediction vs. real estate prices estimation). In this paper, we propose a new problem of task-specific city region partitioning, aiming to find the best partition in a city w.r.t. a given task. We prove this is an NP-hard search problem with no trivial solution. To learn the partition, we first study two variants of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

accessibility is a well-studied concept in the scientific literature its use in practice is still limited. In this chapter, we examine 24 of the latest wave of Accessibility Instruments (AIs) represented in COST Action TU1002 to assess their potential usability as planning support tools for transport and land use practitioners. We here describe their key features (background, conceptual framework, and theoretical underpinnings, operational aspects, relevance for planning practice, strengths and limitations, and visualization) in some detail and we reflect in a more nuanced way, as urban planners, on the data collected thought a survey, on how these instruments can most usefully be deployed to address land use and transport planning issues. We also describe the developer\u2019s perception of usability collected through the same survey used for collecting the key features. We identify, per item, significant similarities and differences and reflect on potential implications for their usability in planning practice. Besides the Accessibility Instruments Survey, this chapter also uses data also from the AIs summary reports, which provide much richer information and explanation than the developer\u2019s survey of how they anticipate their instruments could have a role in urban planning. The chapter is structured into six sections. The first section provides an overview of the background of the 24 AIs involved in this research, followed by a description of the role in urban and transport planning of the AIs. The third section concludes the debate around the key features of the 24 AIs going into detail on conceptual and operational issues, such as the conceptual framework and theoretical underpinnings, the operational characteristics, and the visualization of outputs.

Finding repeating dynamical patterns is important in understanding freight behaviors, and aids freight-friendly planning.

a method for detection of abnormal behaviors related to violent events in urban environments. We have further developed a person detection method and introduced a person tracker as an intermediate stage between person detection and anomaly detection. The method is presented together with results from evaluations based on real sensor data that have been recorded in a realistic urban environment. Several scenarios have been recorded such as normal situations, a person loitering, a person shooting and people escaping from sudden smoke development. The method uses sensor data from a static video surveillance system, consisting of two visual and two thermal infrared cameras. The person detection method combines foreground segmentation with a trained machine learning algorithm which is based on boosting. The tracker associates incoming detections to objects (i.e. people), and generates tracks of world coordinates and velocities of objects. The anomaly detection method, which is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), fuses information that is derived from the tracker. The information contains a number of persons, their positions and velocities. The results indicate that the person detection method in combination with the tracker can produce robust and accurate observations to the HMM, which in turn provide good conditions for accurate anomaly detection. \u00a9 2018 SPIE.","Author Keywords":"Anomaly detection; Camera network; Hidden Markov model; Information fusion","Authors":"Andersson M., Hemstr\u00f6m F., Molin S.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2326276","Text":"Robust anomaly detection in urban environments using sensor and information fusion and a camera network.

the process of urbanizations, such as the residential, entertainment or hospital districts, which can be indicated during the urban planning. Recently, researchers try to discover the region functions with the human mobility data based on machine learning and statistical models. However, previous work always employs the single domain data like mobility information or district attributes to measure the functions. In this paper, we will address the problem by integrating multi-domain data, like human trajectories, base station information and Points-of-Interest attributes. For that, we propose a joint nonnegative matrix factorization model to combine the multi-source data and extract the function distribution of each urban region, then the dominated function among the regions can be uncovered based on the clustering process over the extracted distributions. We also evaluate the performance of our method on the real-world dataset to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model over the baseline methods. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Functional Regions Revealing; Functions distribution discovery; Human mobility pattern; Joint NMF","Authors":"Wang S., Xu Y., Gao S.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICNIDC.2016.7974565","Text":"Revealing functional regions via joint matrix factorization based model.

users\u2019 exposure to different street context types based on network science, geographical information systems (GIS), daily individual trajectories, and street imagery. We consider street context as the inferred usage of the street, based on its buildings and construction, categorized in nine possible labels. The labels define whether the street is residential, commercial or downtown, throughway or not, and other special categories. We apply the analysis to the City of Boston, considering daily trajectories synthetically generated with a model based on call detail records (CDR) and images from Google Street View. Images are categorized both manually and using artificial intelligence (AI). We focus on the city\u2019s four main racial\/ethnic demographic groups (White, Black, Hispanic and Asian), aiming to characterize the differences in what these groups of people see during their daily activities. Based on daily trajectories, we reconstruct most common paths over the street network. We use street demand (number of times a street is included in a trajectory) to detect each group\u2019s most relevant streets and regions. Based on their street demand, we measure the street context distribution for each group. The inclusion of images allows us to quantitatively measure the prevalence of each context and points to qualitative differences on where that context takes place. Other AI methodologies can further exploit these differences. This approach presents the building blocks to further studies that relate mobile devices\u2019 dynamic records with the differences in urban exposure by demographic groups. The addition of AI-based image analysis to street demand can power up the capabilities of urban planning methodologies, compare multiple cities under a unified framework, and reduce the crudeness of GIS-only mobility analysis. Shortening the gap between big data-driven analysis and traditional human classification analysis can help build smarter and more equal cities while reducing the efforts necessary to study a city\u2019s characteristics. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s).","Author Keywords":"AI; CDR; CNN; Context; GIS; Images; Mobility; Network; Segregation; Street","Authors":"Salgado A., Li W., Alhasoun F., Caridi I., Gonzalez M.","DOI":"10.1007\/s41109-021-00382-7","Text":"Street context of various demographic groups in their daily mobility.

understanding of the mechanisms that drive crime and can support decision-makers in developing effective crime reduction strategies. Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction.

structure, i.e., segmenting urban areas into disjoint clusters with similar mobility patterns, can facilitate our understanding of how a city is organized and how different parts of a city interact with each other, which underpin informed decision-making in achieving sustainable urban transportation development and resilient society. In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Auto-encoder; Clustering; Graph embedding; Public transit; Smart card data","Authors":"Zhang T., Duan X., Li Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103027","Text":"Unveiling transit mobility structure towards sustainable cities: An integrated graph embedding approach.

characteristics of network paths has been of particular interest for decades and has led to several successful applications. Such analysis becomes challenging for urban networks as their size and complexity are significantly higher compared to other networks. The state-of-the-art machine learning techniques allow us to detect hidden patterns and, thus, infer the features associated with them. However, very little is known about the impact on the performance of such predictive models by the use of different input representations. In this paper, we design and evaluate six different graph input representations (i.e. representations of the network paths), by considering the network\u2019s topological and temporal characteristics, for being used as inputs for machine learning models to learn the behavior of urban network paths. The representations are validated and then tested with a real-world taxi journeys dataset predicting the tips of using a road network of New York. Our results demonstrate that the input representations that use temporal information help the model to achieve the highest accuracy (root mean-squared error of 1.42$). \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.","Author Keywords":"graph learning; path representation; Urban networks","Authors":"Pagani A., Mehrotra A., Musolesi M.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808319892599","Text":"Graph input representations for machine learning applications in urban network analysis.

recommend the placement of new stores becomes a challenge. Existing work mainly focus on using feature-based models to recommend places for stores. Different from existing works, we focus on the scale-based store placement problem, which cannot recommend places for a store, but also suggest the right scale for the store. Firstly, we extract geospatial features, business features and scale-relevant features to characterize the urban regions. Secondly, we present regression and classification methods for dealing with two situations: recommending places with a given scale, and recommending scale given the place.

granularity of data now available from current information technologies offers an opportunity to study previously unexplored dimensions of the relationship between built environment and social outcomes. Within the field of urban studies, an old question worth revisiting with these new technologies is how to best trace the spatial boundaries that circumscribe a place or location to explore non-work activity. In this study, we explore a data-driven definition of places as units of analysis that can be used to explore non-work activity in Singapore. Such a definition of place characterizes an urban space in terms of its concentration of activity and the topology of the built environment\u2013features that are especially important to urban planners. We utilize available smartphone data to develop a systematic framework to identify locations with a concentrated human presence. Using a cylinder moving over a grid representing Singapore, we scan aggregated smartphones locational requests (by time and cell), identifying areas with atypical high concentrations at a given time. Our tool identified 93 places with a concentrated human presence. Direct observation of six of these places at the selected times in conjunction with additional transportation and population data indicated that the topology of commercial establishments provided a strong approximation of non-work activity at a given time and place. Having established the relevance of commercial establishments in approximating non-work activity, then points-of-interest data within the 93 derived places are used to propose a typology of commercial patches, based on their spatial configuration. Nine metrics of the geometry and topology of patches of establishments, such as compacity and their dependence on proximity to shopping malls, were developed. These combined variables revealed more temporal and spatial variety within locations than had previously been recognized. The most popular places for non-work activity were densely configured with various commercial sub-spaces or patches appealing to different lifestyles and income groups. This study suggests that a location\/place can be best defined as a highly detailed, multi-faceted, and always evolving area of activity rather than as a fixed location with temporal and unmovable boundaries. Suggesting a dynamic redefinition of location\/place that builds on other recent work, this work offers potential contributions to locational models for non-work activity. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","Author Keywords":"cell phone data; clustering; Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise; machine learning; Non-work travel; pattern detection; transportation","Authors":"Lopez R.P., Ferreira J.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808320970209","Text":"Identifying spatio-temporal hotspots of human activity that are popular non-work destinations.

Towards this large-scale crowd dataset, we propose a novel deep learning model called DeepCrowd by designing pyramid architectures and high-dimensional attention mechanism based on Convolutional LSTM.

scale is important for promoting urban health, yet costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-enabled approach to predicting the prevalence of six common non-communicable chronic diseases at the census tract level. We apply our approach to the City of Austin and show that our method can yield fairly accurate predictions. In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes.

Many downstream applications require comprehensive analysis like geographic information retrieval, recommender systems, geographic knowledge graphs, and in general, understanding urban spaces [28]. Points of Interests (POI), as one of the most researched aspects of urban data, has been successfully modeled using concepts borrowed from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the work of Place2Vec [28], a Word2Vec-like statistical model is proposed to represent spatial adjacency with a continuous embedding space. This method successfully models the functional semantics of POIs with regard to several human-assessment based evaluations. However, though the Place2Vec model addresses the distributional heterogeneity within a given spatial context with ITDL augmentation, it does not address the spatial heterogeneity among different regions. To solve this problem, we propose to introduce a hierarchical, density-based, self-adjusting clustering mechanism. The boundary of relatedness and unrelatedness is learned from the given context, where denser areas have tighter bounds while sparser areas have looser ones. We train our model on both the baseline Yelp hierarchical dataset [28] and our OpenStreetMap dataset. We demonstrate that 1) our model significantly improves the performance on 2 of the 3 baseline tasks and the stability of training, and 2) our model generalizes excellently across 112 cities of radically different scales (minimum 1725 POIs, maximum 2694070 POIs), regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa) and types (commercial, touristy, industrial, etc.) without the need of adjusting or tuning any hyperparameters. We also demonstrate that our model can be used to discover interesting facts about cities like inter-city semantic analogy and intra-city connectivity, which can be very useful in urban planning, social computing and public policy making. \u00a9 2020 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Geo-Semantics; Machine Learning; Points of Interest; Similarity","Authors":"Wang Z., Moosavi V.","DOI":"10.1145\/3423334.3431450","Text":"From PIace2Vec to Multi-Scale Built-Environment Representation: A General-Purpose Distributional Embedding for Urban Data Analysis.

transport infrastructure is to use arterial roads for substantial traffic streams intersected with orthogonal branches. However, even with state-of-The-Art urban design methodology used in developed countries, transportation infrastructure in developing countries often does not keep up with the rapid development of travel demand. Unlike developed countries, traffic in the developing countries is heterogeneous, in which different types of vehicles can travel on all lanes. This paper addresses how to regulate the heterogeneous traffic flow by a light control mechanism without changing the urban road network. A novel proposed approach uses reinforcement learning for arterial road control. Experimental results show that the proposed control outperforms existing controls in all three common network structures of urban design despite only using realtime data available in real-world systems. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"heterogeneous traffic; reinforcement learning; Traffic signal control","Authors":"Toan T.V., Van Hoai T.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACOMP50827.2020.00014","Text":"An AI-based approach for arterial signal control in heterogeneous traffic.

for extreme situations, aging and deterioration of existing facilities, costly maintenance, and lack of coordination. Moreover, the transformation from traditional infrastructure into smart infrastructure introduces new challenges both from the underdevelopment of information network and the limitation of AI technologies. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the infrastructure system and the current status of the smart infrastructure system based on the framework of closed feedback control loops: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart infrastructure system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart infrastructure system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart response for city emergency, smart environmental protection, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart infrastructure system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in-depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve the efficiency and safety of city infrastructure through vulnerability-oriented sensing and active monitoring; defining shared responsibilities; communication reinforcements; data visualization; static and dynamic data integration; hierarchical decision making; and optimized and coordinated demand response management. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"automation; modular construction and maintenance; smart agents; ubiquitous real-time guidance and notification","Authors":"Wu S., Yang Z., Bi W., Yuan H., Lu A., Zhao S., Zhou L., Fang Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/UV50937.2020.9426194","Text":"Evaluation of Smart Infrastructure Systems and Novel UV-Oriented Solution for Integration, Resilience, Inclusiveness, and Sustainability.

patterns is of increasing research interest due to a broad range of useful applications, including analysis of transportation systems, location-based social networks, and crowd behavior. The primary focus of this research is to leverage the abundance of trajectory data to automatically and accurately learn latent semantic relationships between different geographical areas (e.g., semantically correlated neighborhoods of a city) as revealed by patterns of moving objects over time. While previous studies have utilized trajectories for this type of analysis at the level of a single geographical area, the results cannot be easily generalized to inform comparative analysis of different geographical areas. In this paper, we study this problem systematically. First, we present a method that utilizes trajectories to learn low-dimensional representations of geographical areas in an embedded space. Then, we develop a statistical method that allows to quantify the degree to which real trajectories deviate from a theoretical null model. The method allows to (a) distinguish geographical proximity to semantic proximity, and (b) inform a comparative analysis of two (or more) models obtained by trajectories defined on different geographical areas. This deep analysis can improve our understanding of how space is perceived by individuals and inform better decisions of urban planning. Our experimental evaluation aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed statistical method in two large-scale real-world data sets coming from the New York City and the city of Porto, Portugal, respectively. The methods we present are generic and can be utilized to inform a number of useful applications, ranging from location-based services, such as point-of-interest recommendations, to finding semantic relationships between different cities. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Network representation learning; Spatial databases; Statistical inference; Trajectory data mining","Authors":"Mehmood S., Papagelis M.","DOI":"10.1109\/MDM48529.2020.00032","Text":"Learning Semantic Relationships of Geographical Areas based on Trajectories.

urban land use detection has become a research hotspot. Numerous methods have been proposed to identify urban land use, in which points of interest (POI) data is widely used, and sometimes other data source like GPS trajectories is incorporated.

In this study, we propose an integrated framework titled Region2vec to detect urban land use type by combining POI and mobile phone data. First, POI-based region embeddings are generated by applying Glove model and LDA model to mine the global spatial information and land use topic distributions respectively. The mobile phone data is utilized to generate human activity pattern-based embeddings. Then a similarity matrix is constructed according to POI-based and activity pattern-based embeddings. Finally, the similarity measures are regarded as clustering features to extract the urban land use results.

In recent years, many researches have been focusing on it by using machine learning algorithms.

In this paper, we present our models which are respectively inspired from KNN, SVR, MLP and RNN, to predict highway traffic volume, aiming at different evaluation metrics. Based on the revised models, model stacking is used which can boost predictive accuracy by combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models. The experiments show that, when the metrics are specified, the revised models outperform the traditional ones.
