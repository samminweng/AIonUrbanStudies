In this network, the spectral and spatial residual blocks consecutively learn discriminative features from abundant spectral signatures and spatial contexts in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). The proposed SSRN is a supervised deep learning framework that alleviates the declining-accuracy phenomenon of other deep learning models. Specifically, the residual blocks connect every other 3-D convolutional layer through identity mapping, which facilitates the backpropagation of gradients. Furthermore, we impose batch normalization on every convolutional layer to regularize the learning process and improve the classification performance of trained models. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the SSRN achieved the state-of-the-art HSI classification accuracy in agricultural, rural-urban, and urban data sets: Indian Pines, Kennedy Space Center, and University of Pavia. \u00a9 1980-2012 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["convolutional layer","residual blocks","residual network","hyperspectral image","learning framework","deep learning","image classification","abundant spectral","batch normalization","blocks connect","blocks consecutively","classification deep","consecutively learn","discriminative features","feature engineering","hyperspectral imagery","identity mapping","imagery hsi","impose batch","indian pines","kennedy space","learn discriminative","learning process","models quantitative","models specifically","network ssrn","pines kennedy","proposed ssrn","qualitative results","raw cubes","results demonstrate","sets indian","space center","spatial contexts","spatial residual","ssrn achieved","supervised deep","takes raw","trained models","hsi classification","learning models","spectral signatures","data sets","input data","urban data","classification performance","classification accuracy"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["convolutional layer","residual blocks","residual network","hyperspectral image","learning framework","image classification","deep learning","abundant spectral","batch normalization","blocks connect","blocks consecutively","classification deep","consecutively learn","discriminative features","feature engineering","hyperspectral imagery","identity mapping","imagery hsi","impose batch","indian pines","kennedy space","learn discriminative","learning process","models quantitative","models specifically","network ssrn","pines kennedy","proposed ssrn","qualitative results","raw cubes","results demonstrate","sets indian","space center","spatial contexts","spatial residual","ssrn achieved","supervised deep","takes raw","trained models","hsi classification","learning models","spectral signatures","data sets","input data","urban data","classification performance","classification accuracy"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["convolutional layer","residual blocks","residual network","hyperspectral image","learning framework","image classification","deep learning","abundant spectral","batch normalization","blocks connect","blocks consecutively","classification deep","consecutively learn","discriminative features","feature engineering","hyperspectral imagery","identity mapping","imagery hsi","impose batch","indian pines","input data","kennedy space","learn discriminative","learning models","learning process","models quantitative","models specifically","network ssrn","pines kennedy","proposed ssrn","qualitative results","raw cubes","results demonstrate","sets indian","space center","spatial contexts","spatial residual","spectral signatures","ssrn achieved","supervised deep","takes raw","trained models","urban data","classification performance","data sets","hsi classification","classification accuracy"]},{"DocId":2,"Year":2012,"Title":"Monitoring land cover change in urban and peri-urban areas using dense time stacks of Landsat satellite data and a data mining approach","Abstract":"Given the pace and scale of urban expansion in many parts of the globe, urban environments are playing an increasingly important role in daily quality-of-life issues, ecological processes, climate, material flows, and land transformations. Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor rates and patterns of urban expansion, but many early challenges - such as distinguishing new urban land from bare ground - remain unsolved. To deal with the high temporal and spatial variability as well as complex, multi-signature classes within settlements, this paper presents a new approach that exploits multi-seasonal information in dense time stacks of Landsat imagery using a multi-date composite change detection technique. The central premise of the approach is that lands within\/near urban areas have distinct temporal trajectories both before and after change occurs, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in several spectral regions. The method relies on a supervised classification that exploits training data of stable\/changed areas interpreted from Google Earth images, and a 'brute force' approach of providing all available Landsat data as input, including scenes with data gaps due to the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) problem. Three classification algorithms (maximum likelihood, boosted decision trees, and support vector machines) were tested for their ability to monitor expansion across five time periods (1988-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009) in three study areas that differ in size, eco-climatic conditions, and rates\/patterns of development. Both the decision trees and support vector machines outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier (overall accuracy of 90-93%, compared to 65%), but the decision trees were superior at handling missing data. Adding transformed features such as band metrics to the Landsat data stack increased accuracy 1-4%, while experiments with a reduced number of features (designed to mimic noisy or missing data) led to a drop in accuracy of 1-9%. The methodology also proved particularly effective for monitoring peri-urbanization outside the urban core, capturing > 98% of village settlements. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier

The spatial configuration of land cover has recently become an important aspect of the study of geomorphological processes related to erosion within watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of soil erosion and sediment yield to land cover patterns in watersheds. However, many landscape metrics are highly correlated and may result in redundancy, which violates the assumptions of a traditional least-squares approach, thus leading to singular solutions or otherwise biased parameter estimates and confidence intervals. Here, we investigated the landscape patterns within watersheds in the Upper Du River watershed (8973km2) in China and examined how the spatial patterns of land cover are related to the soil erosion and sediment yield of watersheds using hydrological modeling and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The results indicate that the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield are closely associated with the land cover patterns. At the landscape level, landscape characteristics, such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), contagion (CONTAG), and patch cohesion index (COHESION), were identified as the primary metrics controlling the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield. The landscape characteristics in watersheds could account for as much as 65% and 74% of the variation in soil erosion and sediment yield, respectively. Greater interspersion and an increased number of patch land cover types may significantly accelerate soilerosion and increase sediment export. PLSR can be used to simply determine the relationships between land-cover patterns and watershed soil erosion and sediment yield, providing quantitative information to allow decision makers to make better choices regarding landscape planning. With readily available remote sensing data and rapid developments in geographic information system (GIS) technology, this practical and simple PLSR approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["sediment yield","soil erosion","watershed soil","land cover","cover patterns","landscape

In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier

In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1\u00a0million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf and for residential buildings is 31.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings \u2013 those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall \u2013 are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["energy use","natural gas","gas

automata (CA) have been increasingly used in simulating urban expansion and land-use dynamics. However, most urban CA models rely on empirical data for deriving transition rules, assuming that the historical trend will continue into the future. Such inertia CA models do not take into account possible external interventions, particularly planning policies, and thus have rarely been used in urban and land-use planning. This paper proposes to use artificial immune systems (AIS) as a technique for incorporating external interventions and generating alternatives in urban simulation. Inspired by biological immune systems, the primary process of AIS is the evolution of a set of 'antibodies' that are capable of learning through interactions with a set of sample 'antigens'. These 'antibodies' finally get 'matured' and can be used to identify\/classify other 'antigens'. An AIS-based CA model incorporates planning policies by altering the evolution mechanism of the 'antibodies'. Such a model is capable of generating different scenarios of urban development under different land-use policies, with which the planners will be able to answer 'what if' questions and to evaluate different options. We applied an AIS-based CA model to the simulation of urban agglomeration development in the Pearl River Delta in southern China. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can be very useful in exploring various planning scenarios of urban development. \u00a9 2010 Taylor & Francis.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["immune systems","planning policies","artificial immune","external interventions","ca models","ca model","urban development","cellular automata","account possible","agglomeration development","biological immune","deriving transition","different options","different policies","evaluate different","evolution mechanism","experiments demonstrate","exploring various","finally get","generating alternatives","generating different","historical trend","incorporates planning","incorporating external","inertia ca","interventions particularly","model incorporates","models rely","paper proposes","particularly planning","possible external","primary process","rules assuming","simulating dynamics","simulation inspired","systems ais","urban agglomeration","urban ca","urban simulation","use artificial","various planning","automata cellular","empirical data","integrating artificial","pearl river","planning scenarios","river delta","southern china","different scenarios","automata ca","proposed model","transition rules","simulating urban","urban expansion"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["immune systems","planning policies","artificial immune","external interventions","ca models","ca model","urban development","cellular automata","account possible","agglomeration development","biological immune","deriving transition","different options","different policies","evaluate different","evolution mechanism","experiments demonstrate","exploring various","finally get","generating alternatives","generating different","historical trend","incorporates planning","incorporating external","inertia ca","interventions particularly","model incorporates","models rely","paper proposes","particularly planning","planning scenarios","possible external","primary process","rules assuming","simulating dynamics","simulation inspired","systems ais","urban agglomeration","urban ca","urban simulation","use artificial","various planning","automata cellular","empirical data","integrating artificial","pearl river","river delta","southern china","different scenarios","automata ca","proposed model","transition rules","simulating urban","urban expansion"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["immune systems","planning policies","artificial immune","external interventions","ca models","ca model","urban development","account possible","agglomeration development","biological immune","deriving transition","different options","different policies","evaluate different","evolution mechanism","experiments demonstrate","exploring various","finally get","generating alternatives","generating different","historical trend","incorporates planning","incorporating external","inertia ca","interventions particularly","model incorporates","models rely","paper proposes","particularly planning","planning scenarios","possible external","primary process","rules assuming","simulating dynamics","simulation inspired","systems ais","urban agglomeration","urban ca","urban simulation","use artificial","various planning","cellular automata","automata cellular","different scenarios","empirical data","integrating artificial","pearl river","river delta","southern china","automata ca","proposed model","transition rules","urban expansion","simulating urban"]},{"DocId":10,"Year":2017,"Title":"Urbanization impact on landscape patterns in Beijing City, China: A spatial heterogeneity perspective","Abstract":"The temporal and spatial characteristics of landscape pattern change can reflect the spatial impact of urbanization on the ecological environment. Studying the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns can provide supports for urban ecological management. Previous studies have examined the quantitative relationship between the social economy and landscape patterns of an entire region, but have not considered the spatial non-stability of this relationship. In this study, we characterized the landscape patterns in Beijing City, China during 2000 and 2010 using four landscape metrics, i.e. patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the aggregation index (AI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity and evolution characteristics of the relationship between the urbanization of population density (POP), gross domestic production (GDP) and nighttime lighting (NTL), and landscape patterns. The evolution of urban landscape patterns indicated a decentralized, aggregated, and fragmented change from the downtown to the suburb and outer suburb. During the 10-year period, the average PD in the downtown increased by 100.6%, and the increase of AI in the suburb was the largest. The PD, ED and SHDI increased by different degrees in the outer suburb. The influences of different urbanization modes on landscape patterns were also different. Infilling mode made the landscape patterns more regular and integrated. The landscape was more broken and complicated under the edge-expanding mode, and the leapfrog mode made PD and SHDI increase slightly. In the relationship interpretation, GWR effectively identified the spatial heterogeneity, and improved the explanatory ability compared to ordinary least squares (OLS). The most intense response to urbanization was the forest landscape and the forest-cultivated land ecotone in the northwest of Beijing City, indicating that this region was ecologically fragile. The population density in the urbanization index had a direct effect on landscape patterns, while the PD affected by urbanization was greater than the shape, aggregation and diversity index. Affected by development policy, urban planning and other factors, the explanation degree of social economy to landscape patterns decreased in 2010. GWR is an effective method for quantifying the spatial differentiation characteristics of urbanization impacts on landscape patterns, which can provide more spatial information and decision criteria for the green development of a compact city. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["landscape patterns","beijing city","spatial heterogeneity","mode made","outer

connections among the visual features of the built environment that impact the human sense of place have long been of interest to a wide variety of fields. Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban region","human sense","perceptual indicators","human perceptions","human perception","street view","accuracy rate","beautiful wealthy","categories segmented","cause place","different perceptions","fields previous","flexible spatial","human perceptual","human ratings","images various","learning measuring","limited data","lively beautiful","measuring human","model achieved","negatively correlated","object categories","people perceive","perceive place","place sentiments","predict human","predicting six","region specifically","region using","results take","safe lively","six human","six perceptual","spatial resolutions","specifically deep","statistical analyses","take researchers","various objects","view image","wealthy depressing","wide variety","work machine","achieved high","data sources","high accuracy","previous studies","visual elements","learning approach","learning model","visual features","new urban","using machine","view images","urban planners","deep learning","machine learning","built environment"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban region","human sense","perceptual indicators","human perceptions","human perception","street view","accuracy rate","beautiful wealthy","categories segmented","cause place","different perceptions","fields previous","flexible spatial","human perceptual","human ratings","images various","learning measuring","limited data","lively beautiful","measuring human","model achieved","negatively correlated","new urban","object categories","people perceive","perceive place","place sentiments","predict human","predicting six","region specifically","region using","results take","safe lively","six human","six perceptual","spatial resolutions","specifically deep","statistical analyses","take researchers","various objects","view image","wealthy depressing","wide variety","work machine","achieved high","visual elements","built environment","data sources","high accuracy","visual features","learning model","previous studies","learning approach","using machine","view images","urban planners","machine learning","deep learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban region","human sense","perceptual indicators","human perceptions","human perception","street view","accuracy rate","beautiful wealthy","categories segmented","cause place","data sources","different perceptions","fields previous","flexible spatial","human perceptual","human ratings","images various","learning measuring","learning model","limited data","lively beautiful","measuring human","model achieved","negatively correlated","new urban","object categories","people perceive","perceive place","place sentiments","predict human","predicting six","previous studies","region specifically","region using","results take","safe lively","six human","six perceptual","spatial resolutions","specifically deep","statistical analyses","take researchers","various objects","view image","wealthy depressing","wide variety","work machine","machine learning","achieved high","high accuracy","learning approach","using machine","visual elements","built environment","visual features","urban planners","view images","deep learning"]},{"DocId":12,"Year":2012,"Title":"Mining urban land-use patterns from volunteered geographic information by means of genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks","Abstract":"In the context of OpenStreetMap (OSM), spatial data quality, in particular completeness, is an essential aspect of its fitness for use in specific applications, such as planning tasks.

During the past few years, the analysis of mobile phone usage patterns, or of social media with longitudinal attributes, have aided the automatic characterization of the dynamics of the urban environment. In this work, we combine a dataset sourced from a telecommunication provider in Spain with a database of millions of geo-tagged venues from Foursquare and we formulate the problem of urban activity inference in a supervised learning framework. In particular, we exploit user communication patterns observed at the base station level in order to predict the activity of Foursquare users who checkin-in at nearby venues. First, we mine a set of machine learning features that allow us to encode the input telecommunication signal of a tower. Subsequently, we evaluate a diverse set of supervised learning algorithms using labels extracted from Foursquare place categories and we consider two application scenarios. Initially, we assess how hard it is to predict specific urban activity of an area, showing that Nightlife and Entertainment spots are those easier to infer, whereas College and Shopping areas are those featuring the lowest accuracy rates. Then, considering a candidate set of activity types in a geographic area, we aim to elect the most prominent one. We demonstrate how the difficulty of the problem increases with the number of classes incorporated in the prediction task, yet the classifiers achieve a considerably better performance compared to a

Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of large numbers of photographs is time consuming. This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm \u2013 Google Cloud Vision \u2013 to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20% of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ecosystem services","cultural ecosystem","social media","content analysis","mapping cultural","media photographs","nature photographs","algorithm google","applied rapidly","approach applies","approach developed","areas automated","automate assessment","automated assessment","automating content","cloud vision","clustering photographs","cultural use","develops novel","google cloud","high vegetation","intangibility data","large areas","large numbers","manual classification","manual content","manual work","natural attractions","novel method","online machine","particular natural","photographs quantifying","saved approximately","services assessment","study develops","time consuming","uses hierarchical","using image","vegetation cover","hierarchical clustering","inform urban","method provides","image recognition","learning algorithm","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ecosystem services","cultural ecosystem","social media","content analysis","mapping cultural","media photographs","nature photographs","algorithm google","applied rapidly","approach applies","approach developed","areas automated","automate assessment","automated assessment","automating content","cloud vision","clustering photographs","cultural use","develops novel","google cloud","hierarchical clustering","high vegetation","inform urban","intangibility data","large areas","large numbers","learning algorithm","manual classification","manual content","manual work","method provides","natural attractions","novel method","online machine","particular natural","photographs quantifying","saved approximately","services assessment","study develops","time consuming","uses hierarchical","using image","vegetation cover","image recognition","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ecosystem services","cultural ecosystem","social media","content analysis","mapping cultural","media photographs","nature photographs","algorithm google","applied rapidly","approach applies","approach developed","areas automated","automate assessment","automated assessment","automating content","cloud vision","clustering photographs","cultural use","develops novel","google cloud","hierarchical clustering","high vegetation","inform urban","intangibility data","large areas","large numbers","learning algorithm","manual classification","manual content","manual work","method provides","natural attractions","novel method","online machine","particular natural","photographs quantifying","saved approximately","services assessment","study develops","time consuming","uses hierarchical","using image","vegetation cover","image recognition","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":15,"Year":2017,"Title":"A machine learning-based method for the large-scale evaluation of the qualities of the urban environment","Abstract":"Given the present size of modern cities, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the qualities of the urban space at every street corner.

To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents. \u00a9 2017 The Authors","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["learning models","urban environment","accurately answer","answer questions","appearance changing","automatic evaluation","building facade","choose two","city appearance","contains three","corner correspondingly","develop good","environment given","fast urbanising","good knowledge","key qualities","leveraging machine","local residents","machine method","machine scores","maintenance quality","modelling results","modern cities","people real","perceptual capacity","physical environment","physical qualities","present computer","present size","previous research","produce estimation","public rating","rating scores","real experience","researchers planners","scores collected","street corner","street wall","three machine","two key","urbanising cities","various physical","vision method","visual experience","present study","urban visual","machine learning","proposed method","urban space","view images","learning techniques","computer vision","street view"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["learning models","urban environment","accurately answer","answer questions","appearance changing","automatic evaluation","building facade","choose two","city appearance","contains three","corner correspondingly","develop good","environment given","fast urbanising","good knowledge","key qualities","leveraging machine","local residents","machine method","machine scores","maintenance quality","modelling results","modern cities","people real","perceptual capacity","physical environment","physical qualities","present computer","present size","produce estimation","public rating","rating scores","real experience","researchers planners","scores collected","street corner","street wall","three machine","two key","urbanising cities","various physical","vision method","visual experience","machine learning","present study","previous research","urban visual","urban space","view images","learning techniques","street view","computer vision","proposed method"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["learning models","urban environment","machine learning","accurately answer","answer questions","appearance changing","automatic evaluation","building facade","choose two","city appearance","contains three","corner correspondingly","develop good","environment given","fast urbanising","good knowledge","key qualities","learning techniques","leveraging machine","local residents","machine method","machine scores","maintenance quality","modelling results","modern cities","people real","perceptual capacity","physical environment","physical qualities","present computer","present size","present study","previous research","produce estimation","public rating","rating scores","real experience","researchers planners","scores collected","street corner","street wall","three machine","two key","urban visual","urbanising cities","various physical","vision method","visual experience","proposed method","urban space","computer vision","view images","street view"]},{"DocId":16,"Year":2016,"Title":"Measuring visual enclosure for street walkability: Using machine learning algorithms and Google Street View imagery","Abstract":"One major limitation currently with studying street level urban design qualities for walkability is the often inconsistent and unreliable measures of streetscape features across different field surveyors even with costly training due to lack of more objective processes, which also make large scale study difficult. The recent advances in sensor technologies and digitization have produced a wealth of data to help research activities by facilitating improved measurements and conducting large scale analysis. This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["visual enclosure","large scale","view imagery","google street","streetscape features","street view","big data","learning algorithms","allows large","applying machine","available google","conducting large","consistent objective","costly training","current approaches","data analytics","design qualities","different field","enclosure measures","facilitating improved","field surveyors","generated objectively","help research","help test","identified fairly","improved measurements","level urban","limitation currently","major limitation","make large","measuring streetscape","measuring visual","objective measures","objective processes","objectively three","paper explores","pedestrian volume","produced wealth","readily available","recent advances","research activities","results showed","scale analysis","scale study","sensor technologies","sky areas","street level","street walkability","study difficult","studying street","three measures","three visual","training due","universally applicable","unreliable measures","walk score","walking behaviors","method allows","walkability using","using machine","urban design","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["visual enclosure","large scale","view imagery","google street","street view","big data","streetscape features","learning algorithms","allows large","applying machine","available google","conducting large","consistent objective","costly training","current approaches","data analytics","design qualities","different field","enclosure measures","facilitating improved","field surveyors","generated objectively","help research","help test","identified fairly","improved measurements","limitation currently","major limitation","make large","measuring streetscape","measuring visual","method allows","objective measures","objective processes","objectively three","paper explores","pedestrian volume","produced wealth","readily available","recent advances","research activities","results showed","scale analysis","scale study","sensor technologies","sky areas","street level","street walkability","study difficult","studying street","three measures","three visual","training due","universally applicable","unreliable measures","walk score","walking behaviors","level urban","walkability using","urban design","using machine","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["visual enclosure","large scale","view imagery","google street","street view","big data","streetscape features","learning algorithms","allows large","applying machine","available google","conducting large","consistent objective","costly training","current approaches","data analytics","design qualities","different field","enclosure measures","facilitating improved","field surveyors","generated objectively","help research","help test","identified fairly","improved measurements","level urban","limitation currently","major limitation","make large","measuring streetscape","measuring visual","method allows","objective measures","objective processes","objectively three","paper explores","pedestrian volume","produced wealth","readily available","recent advances","research activities","results showed","scale analysis","scale study","sensor technologies","sky areas","street level","street walkability","study difficult","studying street","three measures","three visual","training due","universally applicable","unreliable measures","walk score","walking behaviors","using machine","walkability using","machine learning","urban design"]},{"DocId":17,"Year":2008,"Title":"Land-cover change and environmental impact analysis in the Greater Mankato area of Minnesota using remote sensing and GIS modelling","Abstract":"Land use and land-cover (LULC) data provide essential information for environmental management and planning.

Results show that from 1971 to 2003, urban impervious surfaces increased from 18.3% to 32.6%, while cropland and grassland decreased from 54.2% to 39.1%. The dramatic urbanization caused evident environmental impacts in terms of runoff and water quality, whereas the annual air pollution removal rate and carbon storage\/sequestration remained consistent since urban forests were steady over the 32-year span. The results also indicate that highly accurate land-cover features can be extracted effectively from high-resolution imagery by incorporating both spectral and spatial information, applying an image-fusion technique, and utilizing the hierarchical machine-learning Feature Analyst classifier.

In addition to typical urban context features extracted from multiple sources, we extract a special set of features from GPS trajectories based on the implications of traffic flow theory, which provide extra information on the speed-flow relationship. Using the network-wide speed information estimated from a travel speed estimation model, a volume related high level feature is first learned using an unsupervised graphical model. A volume re-interpretation model is then introduced to map the volume related high level feature to the predicted volume using a small amount of ground truth data for training. The framework is evaluated using a GPS trajectory dataset from 33,000 Beijing taxis and volume ground truth data obtained from 4,980 video clips.

We use this data to train and compare deep architectures which have recently shown good performance on standard computer vision tasks (image classification and segmentation), including on geospatial data. Furthermore, we show that the deep representations extracted from satellite imagery of urban environments can be used to compare neighborhoods across several cities.

Four kinds of spatial attributes describing the shape, location, and surrounding environment of buildings were calculated and subsequently employed in the classification. Experiments were performed in suburban and downtown sites in Denver, CO, USA, considering different building components and neighborhood environments. Building type classification results yielded overall accuracy > 70% and Kappa > 0.5 for both sites, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining building type information from LiDAR data. The shape attributes, such as width, footprint area, and perimeter, were most useful for identifying building types. Environmental landscape attributes surrounding buildings, such as the number of road and parking lot pixels, also contributed to obtaining building type information. Combining shape and environmental landscape attributes was necessary to obtain accurate and consistent classification results. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building type","landscape attributes","environmental landscape","lidar remote","obtaining building","type information","classification results","type classification","sensing data","attributes derived","attributes describing","attributes surrounding","building components","building types","buildings delineated","buildings four","classification experiments","co usa","combining shape","considering different","consistent classification","denver co","downtown sites","environments building","footprint area","houses houses","information combining","neighborhood environments","obtain accurate","results yielded","shape attributes","shape location","sites demonstrating","spatial attributes","subsequently employed","surrounding buildings","surrounding environment","three types","types environmental","types houses","usa considering","width footprint","building information","classify buildings","data building","different building","four kinds","identifying building","key elements","management practices","using spatial","yielded overall","classification using","ranging lidar","remote sensing","lidar data","light detection","overall accuracy","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building type","landscape attributes","environmental landscape","lidar remote","obtaining building","type information","classification results","type classification","sensing data","attributes derived","attributes describing","attributes surrounding","building components","building types","buildings delineated","buildings four","classification experiments","co usa","combining shape","considering different","consistent classification","denver co","downtown sites","environments building","footprint area","four kinds","houses houses","information combining","neighborhood environments","obtain accurate","results yielded","shape attributes","shape location","sites demonstrating","spatial attributes","subsequently employed","surrounding buildings","surrounding environment","three types","types environmental","types houses","usa considering","width footprint","yielded overall","building information","classify buildings","data building","different building","identifying building","key elements","management practices","using spatial","classification using","remote sensing","ranging lidar","overall accuracy","lidar data","light detection","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building type","landscape attributes","environmental landscape","lidar remote","obtaining building","sensing data","type information","classification results","type classification","remote sensing","attributes derived","attributes describing","attributes surrounding","building components","building information","building types","buildings delineated","buildings four","classification experiments","classification using","co usa","combining shape","considering different","consistent classification","data building","denver co","different building","downtown sites","environments building","footprint area","four kinds","houses houses","information combining","management practices","neighborhood environments","obtain accurate","results yielded","shape attributes","shape location","sites demonstrating","spatial attributes","subsequently employed","surrounding buildings","surrounding environment","three types","types environmental","types houses","usa considering","using spatial","width footprint","yielded overall","classify buildings","identifying building","key elements","overall accuracy","ranging lidar","lidar data","light detection","urban planning"]},{"DocId":21,"Year":2015,"Title":"Urban land use and land cover classification using remotely sensed sar data through deep belief networks","Abstract":"Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping in urban areas is one of the core applications in remote sensing, and it plays an important role in modern urban planning and management.

machine learning methods in a multi-scale urban energy modeling workflow","Abstract":"The world is rapidly urbanizing, and the energy intensive built environment is becoming increasingly responsible for the world's energy consumption and associated environmental emissions. As a result, significant efforts have been put forth to develop methods that can accurately model and characterize building energy consumption in cities. These models aim to utilize physics-based building energy simulations, reduced-order calculations and statistical learning methods to assess the energy performance of buildings within a dense urban area. However, current urban building energy models are limited in their ability to account for the inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors that can have a substantial impact on building energy use. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S) framework that integrates a network-based machine learning algorithm (ResNet) with engineering simulation to better understand how buildings consume energy on multiple temporal (hourly, daily, monthly) and spatial scales in a city (single building, block, urban). We validate the proposed DUE-S framework on a proof of concept case study of 22 densely located university buildings in California, USA. Our results indicate that the DUE-S framework is able to accurately predict urban scale energy consumption at hourly, daily and monthly intervals. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the integration of data-driven and engineering simulation approaches can partially capture the inter-building energy dynamics and impacts of the urban context and merits future work to explore how they can be improved to predict sub-urban scale energy predictions (single building, block). In the end, successfully predicting and modeling the energy performance of urban buildings has the potential to inform the decision-making of a wide variety of urban sustainability stakeholders

The main objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of dust storms to PM10 concentrations in a desert urban center, the city of Beer-Sheva, Negev, Israel, during the period of 2001-2012. Toward this end, a background value based on the \"dust-free\" season was used as a threshold value to identify potentially \"dust days.\" Subsequently, the net contribution of dust storms to PM10 was assessed. During the study period, daily PM10 concentrations ranged from 6 to over 2000 \u03bcg\/m3. In each year, over 10% of the daily concentrations exceeded the calculated threshold (BVt) of 71 \u03bcg\/m3. An average daily net contribution of dust to PM10 of 122 \u03bcg\/m3 was calculated for the entire study period based on this background value. Furthermore, a dust storm intensity parameter (Ai) was used to analyze several storms with very high PM10 contributions (hourly averages of 1000-5197 \u03bcg\/m3). This analysis revealed that the strongest storms occurred mainly in the last 3 yr of the study. Finally, these findings indicate that this arid urban environment experiences high PM10 levels whose origin lies in both local and regional dust events. Implications:The findings indicate that over time, the urban arid environment experiences high PM10 levels whose origin lies in local and regional dust events. It was noticed that the strongest storms have occurred mainly in the last 3 yr. It is believed that environmental changes such as global warming and desertification may lead to an increased air pollution and risk exposure to human health. \u00a9 2014 Copyright 2014 A&amp;WMA.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dust storms","arid environment","background value","daily concentrations","dust events","environment experiences","experiences high","high levels","net contribution","occurred mainly","origin lies","regional dust","strongest storms","urban arid","findings indicate","study period","aerodynamic diameter","analysis revealed","arid urban","atmospheric particulate","average daily","calculated threshold","close proximity","concentrations exceeded","concentrations ranged","contributions hourly","daily net","days subsequently","desert urban","diameter \u03bcm","dust days","dust sources","dust storm","end background","entire study","environment quantitative","environmental changes","events implications","global warming","high contributions","hourly averages","identify potentially","increased air","intensity parameter","lacking especially","main objective","negev israel","parameter ai","period based","period daily","potentially dust","quantitative information","risk exposure","storm intensity","storms occurred","study finally","threshold bvt","threshold value","value based","\u03bcm levels","human health","particulate matter","urban center","air pollution","urban environments","urban environment"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dust storms","arid environment","background value","daily concentrations","dust events","environment experiences","experiences high","findings indicate","high levels","net contribution","occurred mainly","origin lies","regional dust","strongest storms","study period","urban arid","aerodynamic diameter","analysis revealed","arid urban","atmospheric particulate","average daily","calculated threshold","close proximity","concentrations exceeded","concentrations ranged","contributions hourly","daily net","days subsequently","desert urban","diameter \u03bcm","dust days","dust sources","dust storm","end background","entire study","environment quantitative","environmental changes","events implications","global warming","high contributions","hourly averages","human health","identify potentially","increased air","intensity parameter","lacking especially","negev israel","parameter ai","period based","period daily","potentially dust","quantitative information","risk exposure","storm intensity","storms occurred","study finally","threshold bvt","threshold value","urban center","value based","\u03bcm levels","air pollution","main objective","particulate matter","urban environments","urban environment"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dust storms","arid environment","background value","daily concentrations","dust events","environment experiences","experiences high","findings indicate","high levels","net contribution","occurred mainly","origin lies","regional dust","strongest storms","study period","urban arid","aerodynamic diameter","analysis revealed","arid urban","atmospheric particulate","average daily","calculated threshold","close proximity","concentrations exceeded","concentrations ranged","contributions hourly","daily net","days subsequently","desert urban","diameter \u03bcm","dust days","dust sources","dust storm","end background","entire study","environment quantitative","environmental changes","events implications","global warming","high contributions","hourly averages","human health","identify potentially","increased air","intensity parameter","lacking especially","main objective","negev israel","parameter ai","period based","period daily","potentially dust","risk exposure","storm intensity","storms occurred","study finally","threshold bvt","threshold value","urban environment","urban environments","value based","\u03bcm levels","air pollution","quantitative information","urban center","particulate matter"]},{"DocId":25,"Year":2018,"Title":"Exploring the optimal integration levels between SAR and optical data for better urban land cover mapping in the Pearl River Delta","Abstract":"Integrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data to improve urban land cover classification has been identified as a promising approach. However, which integration level is the most suitable remains unclear but important to many researchers and engineers. This study aimed to compare different integration levels for providing a scientific reference for a wide range of studies using optical and SAR data. SAR data from TerraSAR-X and ENVISAT ASAR in both WSM and IMP modes were used to be combined with optical data at pixel level, feature level and decision levels using four typical machine learning methods. The experimental results indicated that: 1) feature level that used both the original images and extracted features achieved a significant improvement of up to 10% compared to that using optical data alone; 2) different levels of fusion required different suitable methods depending on the data distribution and data resolution. For instance, support vector machine was the most stable at both the feature and decision levels, while random forest was suitable at the pixel level but not suitable at the decision level. 3) By examining the distribution of SAR features, some features (e.g., homogeneity) exhibited a close-to-normal distribution, explaining the improvement from the maximum likelihood method at the feature and decision levels. This indicated the benefits of using texture features from SAR data when being combined with optical data for land cover classification. Additionally, the research also shown that combining optical and SAR data does not guarantee improvement compared with using single data source for urban land cover classification, depending on the

Machine Learning for Identification of Water-Body Types from Urban High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Imagery","Abstract":"Water is one of the vital components for the ecological environment, which plays an important role in human survival and socioeconomic development. Water resources in urban areas are gradually decreasing due to the rapid urbanization, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the precise extraction and automatic identification of water bodies are of great significance and urgently required for urban planning. It should be noted that although some studies have been reported regarding the water-area extraction, to our knowledge, few papers concern the identification of urban water types (e.g., rivers, lakes, canals, and ponds). In this paper, a novel two-level machine-learning framework is proposed for identifying the water types from urban high-resolution remote-sensing images. The framework consists of two interpretation levels: 1) water bodies are extracted at the pixel level, where the water\/shadow\/vegetation indexes are considered and 2) water types are further identified at the object level, where a set of geometrical and textural features are used. Both levels employ machine learning for the image interpretation. The proposed framework is validated using the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 images, over two mega cities in China, i.e., Wuhan and Shenzhen, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved satisfactory accuracies for both water extraction [95.4% (Shenzhen), 96.2% (Wuhan)], and water type classification [94.1% (Shenzhen), 95.9% (Wuhan)] in complex urban areas. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["water types","shenzhen wuhan","water bodies","urban areas","achieved satisfactory","automatic identification","china wuhan","classification shenzhen","combining machine","decreasing due","development water","extraction shenzhen","gradually decreasing","human survival","imagery water","interpretation levels","lakes canals","levels employ","levels water","mega cities","novel framework","object level","paper novel","papers concern","precise extraction","rapid urbanization","reported regarding","rivers lakes","satisfactory accuracies","shenzhen respectively","socioeconomic development","two interpretation","two mega","types rivers","urban imagery","urban images","urban water","urbanization especially","urgently required","validated using","vital components","water extraction","water resources","water type","ecological environment","employ machine","framework consists","great significance","image interpretation","textural features","developing countries","method achieved","pixel level","complex urban","important role","type classification","proposed framework","machine learning","experimental results","results show","proposed method","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["water types","shenzhen wuhan","water bodies","urban areas","achieved satisfactory","automatic identification","china wuhan","classification shenzhen","combining machine","decreasing due","development water","extraction shenzhen","gradually decreasing","great significance","human survival","imagery water","interpretation levels","lakes canals","levels employ","levels water","mega cities","novel framework","object level","paper novel","papers concern","precise extraction","rapid urbanization","reported regarding","rivers lakes","satisfactory accuracies","shenzhen respectively","socioeconomic development","textural features","two interpretation","two mega","types rivers","urban imagery","urban images","urban water","urbanization especially","urgently required","validated using","vital components","water extraction","water resources","water type","ecological environment","employ machine","framework consists","image interpretation","method achieved","pixel level","developing countries","complex urban","important role","type classification","proposed framework","machine learning","experimental results","results show","proposed method","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["water types","shenzhen wuhan","water bodies","urban areas","achieved satisfactory","automatic identification","china wuhan","classification shenzhen","combining machine","decreasing due","developing countries","development water","ecological environment","employ machine","extraction shenzhen","framework consists","gradually decreasing","great significance","human survival","image interpretation","imagery water","important role","interpretation levels","lakes canals","levels employ","levels water","mega cities","method achieved","novel framework","object level","paper novel","papers concern","pixel level","precise extraction","rapid urbanization","reported regarding","rivers lakes","satisfactory accuracies","shenzhen respectively","socioeconomic development","textural features","two interpretation","two mega","types rivers","urban imagery","urban images","urban water","urbanization especially","urgently required","validated using","vital components","water extraction","water resources","water type","complex urban","experimental results","proposed framework","type classification","machine learning","proposed method","results show","urban planning"]},{"DocId":27,"Year":2019,"Title":"Measuring daily accessed street greenery: A human-scale approach for informing better urban planning practices","Abstract":"The public benefits of visible street greenery have been well recognised in a growing literature. Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street greenery","planning practices","accessed street","accessibility google","accessibility helps","accessibility value","accurate measurement","actionable approach","analysis sdna","analytical approach","approach contributes","benefits enjoyed","better urban","city residents","cover mapped","daily exposure","design network","existing viewpoint","green cover","greenery approach","greenery street","growing literature","growing trend","gsv images","high resolution","highlight areas","inform planners","informing better","integrating high","integrating large","large datasets","makes step","map osm","measure greenery","measurements existing","measuring daily","network analysis","networks collected","new measurement","open street","planning interventions","provides tool","public benefits","resolution measurements","spatial design","step forward","street map","two measurements","urban green","urban greenery","urban residents","view gsv","visible greenery","urban planning","daily accessed","remote sensing","visible street","street networks","google street","learning algorithms","urban planners","machine learning","street view"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street greenery","planning practices","accessed street","urban planning","accessibility google","accessibility helps","accessibility value","accurate measurement","actionable approach","analysis sdna","analytical approach","approach contributes","benefits enjoyed","better urban","city residents","cover mapped","daily exposure","design network","existing viewpoint","green cover","greenery approach","greenery street","growing literature","growing trend","gsv images","high resolution","highlight areas","inform planners","informing better","integrating high","integrating large","large datasets","makes step","map osm","measure greenery","measurements existing","measuring daily","network analysis","networks collected","new measurement","open street","planning interventions","provides tool","public benefits","resolution measurements","spatial design","step forward","street map","street networks","two measurements","urban green","urban greenery","urban residents","view gsv","visible greenery","daily accessed","remote sensing","visible street","google street","learning algorithms","urban planners","machine learning","street view"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street greenery","planning practices","accessed street","urban planning","accessibility google","accessibility helps","accessibility value","accurate measurement","actionable approach","analysis sdna","analytical approach","approach contributes","benefits enjoyed","better urban","city residents","cover mapped","daily accessed","daily exposure","design network","existing viewpoint","green cover","greenery approach","greenery street","growing literature","growing trend","gsv images","high resolution","highlight areas","inform planners","informing better","integrating high","integrating large","large datasets","makes step","map osm","measure greenery","measurements existing","measuring daily","network analysis","networks collected","new measurement","open street","planning interventions","provides tool","public benefits","remote sensing","resolution measurements","spatial design","step forward","street map","street networks","two measurements","urban green","urban greenery","urban planners","urban residents","view gsv","visible greenery","visible street","learning algorithms","machine learning","google street","street view"]},{"DocId":28,"Year":2018,"Title":"Estimation of daily maximum and minimum air temperatures in urban landscapes using MODIS time series satellite data","Abstract":"Urban air temperature is considered a significant variable for a variety of urban issues, and analyzing the spatial patterns of air temperature is important for urban planning and management. However, insufficient weather stations limit accurate spatial representation of temperature within a heterogeneous city. This study used a random forest machine learning approach to estimate daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin) for two megacities with different climate characteristics: Los Angeles, USA, and Seoul, South Korea. This study used eight time-series land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with seven auxiliary variables: elevation, solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index, latitude, longitude, aspect, and the percentage of impervious area. We found different relationships between the eight time-series LSTs with Tmax\/Tmin for the two cities, and designed eight schemes with different input LST variables. The schemes were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 10-fold cross-validation. The best schemes produced R2 of 0.850 and 0.777 and RMSE of 1.7 \u00b0C and 1.2 \u00b0C for Tmax and Tmin in Los Angeles, and R2 of 0.728 and 0.767 and RMSE of 1.1 \u00b0C and 1.2 \u00b0C for Tmax and Tmin in Seoul, respectively. LSTs obtained the day before were crucial for estimating daily urban air temperature. Estimated air temperature patterns showed that Tmax was highly dependent on the geographic factors (e.g., sea breeze, mountains) of the two cities, while Tmin showed marginally distinct temperature differences between built-up and vegetated areas in the two cities. \u00a9 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

with the artificial neural network-based Land Transformation Model: an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework","Abstract":"Cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used by researchers over the last three decades to simulate land-use change (LUC). While conventional CA and ANN models assign a cell to only one land-use class, in reality, a cell may belong to several land-use classes simultaneously. The recently developed multi-label (ML) concept overcomes this limitation in land change science. Although the ML concept is a new paradigm with nonexclusive classes and has shown considerable merit in several applications, few studies in land change science have applied it. In addition, determining transition rules in conventional CA is difficult when the number of drivers is large. Since CA has been shown as a potential model to consider neighborhood effects and ANN has been shown effective in determining CA transition rules, we integrated both CA with an ANN model to overcome limitations of each tool. In this study, we specifically extended the ANN-based Land Transformation Model (LTM) with both a CA-based model and the ML concept to create an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework. We also compared, using standard evaluation measures, differences between the proposed integrated model with a conventional CA-based LTM model (called the ml-CA-LTM). Parameterization was made using a learning and testing procedure common in machine learning. Results showed that the modified LUC model, ML-CA-LTM, produced consistently better goodness of fit calibration values compared to the ml-CA-LTM. The outcome of this modified model can be used by managers and decision makers for improved urban planning. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ml concept","change science","conventional ca","integrated modeling","land transformation","transformation model","modeling framework","transition rules","land change","cellular automata","artificial neural","addition determining","ann models","assign cell","better goodness","ca transition","calibration values","classes simultaneously","compared using","concept overcomes","consider neighborhood","considerable merit","consistently better","conventional ltm","determining ca","determining transition","developed ml","evaluation measures","fit calibration","framework cellular","improved urban","integrated model","learning results","ltm model","luc model","made using","measures differences","model called","model ltm","model produced","models assign","modified luc","modified model","neural land","new paradigm","nonexclusive classes","overcome limitations","potential model","procedure common","produced consistently","proposed integrated","reality cell","recently developed","shown considerable","shown effective","simulate change","specifically extended","standard evaluation","testing procedure","using learning","using standard","values compared","ann model","change luc","decision makers","networks anns","three decades","results showed","automata ca","neighborhood effects","neural networks","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ml concept","change science","conventional ca","integrated modeling","land transformation","transformation model","modeling framework","transition rules","land change","artificial neural","cellular automata","addition determining","ann models","assign cell","better goodness","ca transition","calibration values","classes simultaneously","compared using","concept overcomes","consider neighborhood","considerable merit","consistently better","conventional ltm","determining ca","determining transition","developed ml","evaluation measures","fit calibration","framework cellular","improved urban","integrated model","learning results","ltm model","luc model","made using","measures differences","model called","model ltm","model produced","models assign","modified luc","modified model","neural land","new paradigm","nonexclusive classes","overcome limitations","potential model","procedure common","produced consistently","proposed integrated","reality cell","recently developed","shown considerable","shown effective","simulate change","specifically extended","standard evaluation","testing procedure","using learning","using standard","values compared","ann model","change luc","decision makers","networks anns","neural networks","three decades","results showed","automata ca","neighborhood effects","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ml concept","change science","conventional ca","integrated modeling","land transformation","modeling framework","transformation model","transition rules","land change","artificial neural","addition determining","ann models","assign cell","better goodness","ca transition","calibration values","classes simultaneously","compared using","concept overcomes","consider neighborhood","considerable merit","consistently better","conventional ltm","determining ca","determining transition","developed ml","evaluation measures","fit calibration","framework cellular","improved urban","integrated model","learning results","ltm model","luc model","made using","measures differences","model called","model ltm","model produced","models assign","modified luc","modified model","neural land","new paradigm","nonexclusive classes","overcome limitations","potential model","procedure common","produced consistently","proposed integrated","reality cell","recently developed","shown considerable","shown effective","simulate change","specifically extended","standard evaluation","testing procedure","three decades","using learning","using standard","values compared","cellular automata","ann model","change luc","decision makers","networks anns","results showed","neural networks","automata ca","neighborhood effects","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":30,"Year":2014,"Title":"From land cover-graphs to urban structure types","Abstract":"Urban structure types (UST) are an initial interest and basic instrument for monitoring, controlling and modeling tasks of urban planners and decision makers during ongoing urbanization processes.

This paper presents a novel method to model urban land-use change using support-vector machines (SVMs), a new generation of machine learning algorithms used in classification and regression domains. An SVM modeling framework has been developed to analyze land-use change in relation to various factors such as population, distance to roads and facilities, and surrounding land use. As land-use data are generally unbalanced, in the sense that the unchanged data overwhelm the changed data, traditional methods are incapable of classifying relatively minor land-use changes with high accuracy. To circumvent this problem, an unbalanced SVM has been adopted by enhancing the standard SVMs. A case study of Calgary land-use change demonstrates that the unbalanced SVMs can achieve high and reliable performance for land-use-change modeling. \u00a9 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["achieve high","analyze change","calgary change","change demonstrates","change using","changed data","classifying relatively","data overwhelm","data traditional","generally unbalanced","high accuracy","machines modeling","machines svms","minor changes","modeling change","modeling using","new generation","novel method","population distance","presents novel","regression domains","relatively minor","reliable performance","standard svms","surrounding land","svm modeling","svms case","svms new","traditional methods","unbalanced machines","unbalanced svm","unbalanced svms","unchanged data","using machines","using unbalanced","various factors","model urban","modeling framework","urban change","learning algorithms","case study","paper presents","land use","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["achieve high","analyze change","calgary change","change demonstrates","change using","changed data","classifying relatively","data overwhelm","data traditional","generally unbalanced","high accuracy","machines modeling","machines svms","minor changes","modeling change","modeling using","new generation","novel method","population distance","presents novel","regression domains","relatively minor","reliable performance","standard svms","surrounding land","svm modeling","svms case","svms new","traditional methods","unbalanced machines","unbalanced svm","unbalanced svms","unchanged data","using machines","using unbalanced","various factors","model urban","modeling framework","urban change","learning algorithms","case study","paper presents","land use","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["achieve high","analyze change","calgary change","change demonstrates","change using","changed data","classifying relatively","data overwhelm","data traditional","generally unbalanced","high accuracy","machines modeling","machines svms","minor changes","model urban","modeling change","modeling framework","modeling using","new generation","novel method","population distance","presents novel","regression domains","relatively minor","reliable performance","standard svms","surrounding land","svm modeling","svms case","svms new","traditional methods","unbalanced machines","unbalanced svm","unbalanced svms","unchanged data","urban change","using machines","using unbalanced","various factors","case study","learning algorithms","paper presents","land use","machine learning"]},{"DocId":32,"Year":2019,"Title":"Beyond Word2vec: An approach for urban functional region extraction and identification by combining Place2vec and POIs","Abstract":"The actual functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter, tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424).

USAR modeling and \"micro-bot\" employment advantages are addressed first, followed by a discussion of numerical method shortcomings in the context of search asset allocation. KNOBSAR is then proposed as an initial expert system prototype designed to interact with various structural collapse simulation packages and provide advice on search asset allocation to specific entry points within a crisis site. KNOBSAR structure and design is then illustrated in terms of micro-bot allocation scenarios to various collapsed structure entry points. The conclusion drawn from literature review, experimentation and personal experience is that AI technologies in the form of robotic platforms and decision support tools can have a tremendous impact on

Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical

metrics describing the presence and the configuration of built-up and open space areas for mapping distinct types of urban form and function at city block level. Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land use and urban form classification based on these metrics.

Concerning high resolution remote image images, encoding the spatial features in an efficient and robust fashion is the key to generating discriminatory models to classify them. Even though many visual descriptors have been proposed or successfully used to encode spatial features of remote sensing images, some applications, using this sort of images, demand more specific description techniques. Deep Learning, an emergent machine learning approach based on neural networks, is capable of learning specific features and classifiers at the same time and adjust at each step, in real time, to better fit the need of each problem. For several task, such image classification, it has achieved very good results, mainly boosted by the feature learning performed which allows the method to extract specific and adaptable visual features depending on the data. In this paper, we propose a novel network capable of learning specific spatial features from remote sensing images, with any pre-processing step or descriptor evaluation, and classify them. Specifically, automatic feature learning task aims at discovering hierarchical structures from the raw data, leading to a more representative information. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for urban planning, crop and forest management and climate modelling. The propose convolutional neural network has six layers: three convolutional, two fully-connected and one classifier layer. So, the five first layers are responsible to extract visual features while the last one is responsible to classify the images. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using two datasets: (i) the popular aerial image dataset UCMerced Land-use and, (ii) a multispectral high-resolution scenes of the Brazilian Coffee Scenes.

years, machine-learning techniques have expanded enormously. These approaches are increasingly being applied to traffic and transportation problems formerly reserved for formal statistical approaches such as discrete choice models. Part of the reason for this has to do with research trends, but there are some potential advantages associated with such techniques, including the ability to model nonlinear systems; the ease with which symbolic, nominal, or categorical variables can be included; and the ability of these methods to deal with noisy data. The use of two modeling techniques, the nested logit model and the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, was investigated in terms of their applicability to the household vehicle choice problem.

To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km 2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales. \u00a9

In recent years, the prevalence of positioning methods and technologies, such as the global positioning system, cellular radio tower geo-positioning, and WiFi positioning systems, has driven efforts to collect human mobility data and to mine patterns of interest within these data in order to promote the development of location-based services and applications. The efforts to mine significant patterns within large-scale, high-dimensional mobility data have solicited use of advanced analysis techniques, usually based on machine learning methods, and therefore, in this paper, we survey and assess different approaches and models that analyze and learn human mobility patterns using mainly machine learning methods. We categorize these approaches and models in a taxonomy based on their positioning characteristics, the scale of analysis, the properties of the modeling approach, and the class of applications they can serve. We find that these applications can be categorized into three classes: user modeling, place modeling, and trajectory modeling, each class with its characteristics. Finally, we analyze the short-term trends and future challenges of human mobility analysis. \u00a9 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["human mobility","mobility data","learning methods","mobility patterns","advanced analysis","analysis techniques","analyzing human","applications human","assess different","cellular radio","characteristics finally","classes user","collect human","commute patterns","daily commute","data survey","different approaches","driven efforts","future challenges","global spread","infectious diseases","learn human","mainly machine","modeling approach","modeling place","patterns reflect","patterns using","place modeling","positioning characteristics","positioning methods","positioning systems","radio tower","significant patterns","solicited use","system cellular","taxonomy based","techniques usually","three classes","trajectory modeling","user modeling","using mainly","usually based","wifi positioning","machine learning","mobility analysis","recent years","global positioning","positioning system","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["human mobility","learning methods","mobility data","mobility patterns","machine learning","advanced analysis","analysis techniques","analyzing human","applications human","assess different","cellular radio","characteristics finally","classes user","collect human","commute patterns","daily commute","data survey","different approaches","driven efforts","future challenges","global spread","infectious diseases","learn human","mainly machine","modeling approach","modeling place","patterns reflect","patterns using","place modeling","positioning characteristics","positioning methods","positioning systems","radio tower","significant patterns","solicited use","system cellular","taxonomy based","techniques usually","three classes","trajectory modeling","user modeling","using mainly","usually based","wifi positioning","global positioning","mobility analysis","positioning system","recent years","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["human mobility","learning methods","mobility data","mobility patterns","machine learning","advanced analysis","analysis techniques","analyzing human","applications human","assess different","cellular radio","characteristics finally","classes user","collect human","commute patterns","daily commute","data survey","different approaches","driven efforts","future challenges","global spread","infectious diseases","learn human","mainly machine","modeling approach","modeling place","patterns reflect","patterns using","place modeling","positioning characteristics","positioning methods","positioning system","radio tower","significant patterns","solicited use","system cellular","taxonomy based","techniques usually","three classes","trajectory modeling","user modeling","using mainly","usually based","wifi positioning","global positioning","mobility analysis","positioning systems","recent years","urban planning"]},{"DocId":41,"Year":2017,"Title":"Building block level urban land-use information retrieval based on Google Street View images","Abstract":"Land-use maps are important references for urban planning and urban studies. Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the fa\u00e7ades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their fa\u00e7ade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &

suffer from serious fine particulate matter (PMPM2.5) pollution. As the emission sources or adsorption sinks, land use and the corresponding landscape pattern unavoidably affect the concentration. However, the correlation varies with different regions and scales, leaving a significant gap for urban planning. This study clarifies the correlation with the aid of in situ and satellite-based spatial datasets over six urban agglomerations in China. Two coverage and four landscape indices are adopted to represent land use and landscape pattern. Specifically, the coverage indices include the area ratios of forest (F_PLAND) and built-up areas (C_PLAND). The landscape indices refer to the perimeter-area fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Then, the correlation between PMPM2.5 concentration with the selected indices are evaluated from supporting the potential urban planning. Results show that the correlations are weak with the in situ PMPM2.5 concentration, which are significant with the regional value. It means that land use coverage and landscape pattern affect PMPM2.5 at a relatively large scale. Furthermore, regional PMPM2.5 concentration negatively correlate to F_PLAND and positively to C_PLAND (significance at p &lt; 0.05), indicating that forest helps to improve air quality, while built-up areas worsen the pollution. Finally, the heterogeneous landscape presents positive correlation to the regional PMPM2.5 concentration in most regions, except for the urban agglomeration with highly-developed urban (i.e., the Jing-Jin-Ji and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations). It suggests that centralized urbanization would be helpful for PMPM2.5 pollution controlling by reducing the emission sources in most regions. Based on the results, the potential urban planning is proposed for controlling PMPM2.5 pollution for each urban agglomeration.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["landscape

Views","Abstract":"Urban forms at human-scale, i.e., urban environments that individuals can sense (e.g., sight, smell, and touch) in their daily lives, can provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, such as urban planning and environment auditing. The analysis of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design. However, such analysis is complex because of the involvement of spatial, multi-scale (i.e., city, region, and street), and multivariate (e.g., greenery and sky ratios) natures of urban forms. In addition, current methods either lack quantitative measurements or are limited to a small area. The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales; 2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with case studies on the real-world datasets of four cities, i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Greater London and New York City.

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big

recognized ten factors as increasing the inner-city temperature compared with that of the surrounding suburbs. The UHI effect is a leading cause of heat-related diseases and mortality in many nations. However, there are still two main shortcomings. First, the effect of UHI is not well recognized in arid and semi-arid regions. Second, the association of multi-dimensional information with surface temperature in urban areas must be examined. This study focuses on the height-related aspects of urban geometry in an arid region. A range of multispectral and spatial vector data were used to derive the surface temperature and two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) information of the study area. All information was aggregated into a grid with common spatial resolution to create a homogeneous dataset. The machine learning statistical model of a boosted regression tree (BRT) was used to reflect the relative influence of 2D and 3D indicators with land surface temperature. Our results showed a cooler surface temperature in the city than in the surrounding area, leading to the question of whether the established UHI definition encompasses all types of cities. In addition, the thermal band was able to distinguish different spatial structures in the study area. The BRT analysis demonstrated that both multi-dimensional 2D and 3D indicators affect the surface temperature. In particular, the 3D indicators play a more important role than 2D indicators in shaping the surface temperature at different urban geometries of the study area. This new method can help urban planners identify the most influential 2D and 3D indicators that affect the surface temperature in different districts of a city. \u00a9 2017","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["surface temperature","study area","analysis demonstrated","area leading","arid region","brt analysis","common spatial","conditions urban","cooler surface","create homogeneous","definition encompasses","different districts","different spatial","distinguish different","established uhi","help urban","homogeneous dataset","indicators affect","indicators play","leading cause","main shortcomings","planners identify","recognized ten","region range","relative influence","showed cooler","spatial vector","surrounding area","surrounding suburbs","temperature compared","ten factors","thermal band","uhi definition","uhi studies","vector data","important role","learning statistical","new method","spatial resolution","spatial structures","statistical model","study focuses","thermal conditions","two main","urban geometries","urban geometry","different urban","results showed","tree brt","boosted regression","regression tree","uhi effect","urban thermal","island uhi","urban planners","heat island","land surface","urban heat","urban areas","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["surface temperature","study area","analysis demonstrated","area leading","arid region","brt analysis","common spatial","conditions urban","cooler surface","create homogeneous","definition encompasses","different districts","different spatial","distinguish different","established uhi","help urban","homogeneous dataset","indicators affect","indicators play","leading cause","learning statistical","main shortcomings","planners identify","recognized ten","region range","relative influence","showed cooler","spatial vector","statistical model","study focuses","surrounding area","surrounding suburbs","temperature compared","ten factors","thermal band","two main","uhi definition","uhi studies","urban geometries","urban geometry","vector data","boosted regression","important role","new method","regression tree","results showed","spatial resolution","spatial structures","thermal conditions","tree brt","urban planners","different urban","uhi effect","urban thermal","island uhi","urban areas","heat island","urban heat","land surface","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["surface temperature","study area","analysis demonstrated","area leading","arid region","brt analysis","common spatial","conditions urban","cooler surface","create homogeneous","definition encompasses","different districts","different spatial","distinguish different","established uhi","help urban","homogeneous dataset","indicators affect","indicators play","leading cause","learning statistical","main shortcomings","planners identify","recognized ten","region range","relative influence","showed cooler","spatial vector","statistical model","study focuses","surrounding area","surrounding suburbs","temperature compared","ten factors","thermal band","two main","uhi definition","uhi studies","urban geometries","urban geometry","vector data","boosted regression","important role","new method","regression tree","results showed","spatial resolution","spatial structures","thermal conditions","tree brt","urban planners","different urban","uhi effect","urban thermal","island uhi","urban areas","heat island","urban heat","land surface","machine learning"]},{"DocId":46,"Year":2017,"Title":"Forecasting smog-related health hazard based on social media and physical sensor","Abstract":"Smog disasters are becoming more and more frequent and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas. Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people\u05f3s reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard. In addition, this forecasting approach can provide decision support for smog-related health hazard management through functions like early warning. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["health hazard","physical sensor","social media","day health","smog severity","sensor data","public health","alternative machine","analytic approach","ann model","areas social","artificial neural","capture possible","cause severe","current health","current smog","diffusion data","early stage","early warning","effective channel","empirical findings","forecast health","forecasting approach","forecasting health","functions like","hazard based","hazard forecasting","hazard management","health disasters","health especially","health hazards","help researchers","increasingly effective","information diffusion","integrate social","like early","mining raw","model health","network ann","network information","observe reactions","possible public","predictive analytic","propose predictive","provide decision","raw microblogging","sensor smog","severe consequences","severity observations","smog disasters","smog observations","decision support","microblogging text","neural network","better understand","data source","learning methods","urban areas","urban data","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["health hazard","physical sensor","social media","day health","public health","sensor data","smog severity","alternative machine","analytic approach","ann model","areas social","artificial neural","better understand","capture possible","cause severe","current health","current smog","data source","decision support","diffusion data","early stage","early warning","effective channel","empirical findings","forecast health","forecasting approach","forecasting health","functions like","hazard based","hazard forecasting","hazard management","health disasters","health especially","health hazards","help researchers","increasingly effective","information diffusion","integrate social","like early","mining raw","model health","network ann","network information","observe reactions","possible public","predictive analytic","propose predictive","provide decision","raw microblogging","sensor smog","severe consequences","severity observations","smog disasters","smog observations","learning methods","microblogging text","neural network","urban areas","urban data","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["health hazard","physical sensor","social media","day health","sensor data","smog severity","public health","alternative machine","analytic approach","ann model","areas social","artificial neural","better understand","capture possible","cause severe","current health","current smog","data source","decision support","diffusion data","early stage","early warning","effective channel","empirical findings","forecast health","forecasting approach","forecasting health","functions like","hazard based","hazard forecasting","hazard management","health disasters","health especially","health hazards","help researchers","increasingly effective","information diffusion","integrate social","like early","mining raw","model health","network ann","network information","observe reactions","possible public","predictive analytic","propose predictive","provide decision","raw microblogging","sensor smog","severe consequences","severity observations","smog disasters","smog observations","microblogging text","neural network","learning methods","urban areas","urban data","machine learning"]},{"DocId":47,"Year":2016,"Title":"Semantic framework of internet of things for smart cities: Case studies","Abstract":"In recent years, the advancement of sensor technology has led to the generation of heterogeneous Internet-of-Things (IoT) data by smart cities.

Due to these changes are a response to urban land use and land cover (LULC), remote sensing images are interpreted by the method of supervised classification and visual interpretation to obtain the LULC data for research on landscape pattern index (LPI) and ecosystem service value (ESV) of Xi'an city, China. Combined with urban planning theory, concentric buffer zones were used to explore the characteristics and relationships between LPIs and ESVs along an urban-rural gradient. Ten landscape indices and nine ecosystem service types were selected to analyze the correlation and construct multiple linear regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to eliminate the problem of multi-collinearity in the process of model construction. Results indicate that the highest landscape fragmentation was mainly distributed in the urban-rural fringe, 20\u201335 km from the urban center, and patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and landscape shape index (LSI) recorded the highest values. Total ESV of Xi'an city was 20493.65 \u00d7 106 CNY in 2016, and the mean value of ESV increased from 0.06 \u00d7 106 CNY to 2.60 \u00d7 106 CNY along an urban-rural gradient. This finding indicates that a higher ESV was recorded for the natural landscape. Results also indicated that SHAPE_MN, FRAC_MN, PLADJ, and AI recorded a positive effect on total ESV whilst ED and PD have a negative effect on total ESV. Results from the regression models showed quantitative relationships between ESVs and LPIs which revealed how ecosystem service values were affected by the landscape pattern.

techniques","Abstract":"Along with the gradually accelerated urbanization process, simulating and predicting the future pattern of the city is of great importance to the prediction and prevention of some environmental, economic and urban issues. Previous studies have generally integrated traditional machine learning with cellular automaton (CA) models to simulate urban development. Nevertheless, difficulties still exist in the process of obtaining more accurate results with CA models; such difficulties are mainly due to the insufficient consideration of neighborhood effects during urban transition rule mining. In this paper, we used an effective deep learning method, named convolution neural network for united mining (UMCNN), to solve the problem. UMCNN has substantial potential to get neighborhood information from its receptive field. Thus, a novel CA model coupled with UMCNN and Markov chain was designed to improve the performance of simulating urban expansion processes. Choosing the Pearl River Delta of China as the study area, we excavate the driving factors and the transformational relations revealed by the urban land-use patterns in 2000, 2005 and 2010 and further simulate the urban expansion status in 2020 and 2030. Additionally, three traditional machine-learning-based CA models (LR, ANN and RFA) are built to attest the practicality of the proposed model. In the comparison, the proposed method reaches the highest simulation accuracy and landscape index similarity. The predicted urban expansion results reveal that the economy will continue to be the primary factor in the study area from 2010 to 2030. The proposed model can serve as guidance in urban planning and government decision-making. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban expansion","ca models","deep learning","proposed model","study area","simulating urban","accelerated urbanization","accurate results","additionally three","convolution neural","effective deep","environmental economic","expansion processes","expansion results","expansion status","future pattern","generally integrated","get neighborhood","gradually accelerated","index similarity","insufficient consideration","integrated traditional","issues previous","landscape index","lr ann","mainly due","method named","method reaches","mining transition","mining umcnn","model coupled","models lr","named convolution","neighborhood information","novel ca","predicted urban","primary factor","problem umcnn","process simulating","processes choosing","receptive field","relations revealed","results reveal","rule mining","substantial potential","three traditional","traditional machine","transformational relations","transition rule","united mining","urban transition","automaton ca","cellular automaton","great importance","highest simulation","learning method","pearl river","previous studies","river delta","simulation accuracy","traditional ca","urban issues","driving factors","markov chain","simulate urban","urbanization process","ca model","learning techniques","neighborhood effects","proposed method","transition rules","urban patterns","urban development","cellular automata","neural network","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ca models","urban expansion","deep learning","proposed model","study area","simulating urban","accelerated urbanization","accurate results","additionally three","convolution neural","effective deep","environmental economic","expansion processes","expansion results","expansion status","future pattern","generally integrated","get neighborhood","gradually accelerated","great importance","index similarity","insufficient consideration","integrated traditional","issues previous","landscape index","lr ann","mainly due","method named","method reaches","mining transition","mining umcnn","model coupled","models lr","named convolution","neighborhood information","novel ca","predicted urban","primary factor","problem umcnn","process simulating","processes choosing","receptive field","relations revealed","results reveal","rule mining","substantial potential","three traditional","traditional machine","transformational relations","transition rule","united mining","urban issues","urban transition","automaton ca","cellular automaton","highest simulation","learning method","learning techniques","pearl river","previous studies","river delta","simulation accuracy","traditional ca","urbanization process","markov chain","simulate urban","ca model","driving factors","neighborhood effects","proposed method","transition rules","urban patterns","urban development","cellular automata","neural network","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban expansion","ca models","deep learning","study area","proposed model","simulating urban","accelerated urbanization","accurate results","additionally three","convolution neural","effective deep","environmental economic","expansion processes","expansion results","expansion status","future pattern","generally integrated","get neighborhood","gradually accelerated","great importance","index similarity","insufficient consideration","integrated traditional","issues previous","landscape index","learning method","learning techniques","lr ann","mainly due","method named","method reaches","mining transition","mining umcnn","model coupled","models lr","named convolution","neighborhood information","novel ca","predicted urban","previous studies","primary factor","problem umcnn","process simulating","processes choosing","receptive field","relations revealed","results reveal","rule mining","substantial potential","three traditional","traditional machine","transformational relations","transition rule","united mining","urban issues","urban transition","automaton ca","cellular automaton","highest simulation","pearl river","proposed method","river delta","simulation accuracy","traditional ca","urban patterns","urbanization process","driving factors","markov chain","simulate urban","ca model","neighborhood effects","transition rules","urban development","neural network","cellular automata","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":51,"Year":2016,"Title":"Impacts of land use and amenities on public transport use, urban planning and design","Abstract":"Various land-use configurations are known to have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and \"interpretability\". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of \"regional centers\" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["transit ridership","ridership

While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change.

multi-temporal remote sensing imagery","Abstract":"Frequent human activity and rapid urbanization have led to an assortment of environmental issues. Monitoring land-cover change is critical to efficient environmental management and urban planning. The current study had two objectives. The first was to compare pixel-based random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifier methods and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm both in pixel-based and object-based approaches for classification of land-cover in a heterogeneous landscape for 2010. The second was to examine spatio-temporal land-cover change over the last two decades (1990\u20132010) using Landsat data. This study found that the object-based SVM classifier is the most accurate with an overall classification accuracy of 93.54% and a kappa value of 0.88. A post-classification change detection algorithm was used to determine the trend of change between land-cover classes. The most significant change from 1990 to 2010 was caused by the expansion of built-up areas. In addition to the net changes, the rate of annual change for each phenomenon was calculated to obtain a better understanding of the process of change. Between 1990 and 2010, an average of 4.53% of lands turned to the built-up annually and there was an annual decrease of about 0.81% in natural land. If the current trend of change continues, regardless of the actions of sustainable development, drastic declines in natural areas will ensue. The results of this study can be a valuable baseline for land-cover managers in the region to better understand the current situation and adopt appropriate strategies for management of land-cover. \u00a9 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["adopt appropriate","annual change","annual decrease","appropriate strategies","better understanding","change continues","change using","classifier methods","compare random","continues regardless","current study","current trend","decades using","detection algorithm","development drastic","drastic declines","dt classifier","efficient environmental","environmental issues","examine change","frequent human","human activity","imagery frequent","issues monitoring","kappa value","lands turned","monitoring change","natural areas","natural land","net changes","obtain better","sensing imagery","significant change","study found","svm algorithm","svm classifier","two decades","two objectives","using classifiers","valuable baseline","better understand","current situation","heterogeneous landscape","tree dt","landsat data","overall classification","rapid urbanization","sustainable development","change detection","decision tree","machine svm","classification accuracy","environmental management","using landsat","vector machine","support vector","forest rf","random forest","remote sensing","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["adopt appropriate","annual change","annual decrease","appropriate strategies","better understand","better understanding","change continues","change using","classifier methods","compare random","continues regardless","current situation","current study","current trend","decades using","detection algorithm","development drastic","drastic declines","dt classifier","efficient environmental","environmental issues","examine change","frequent human","heterogeneous landscape","human activity","imagery frequent","issues monitoring","kappa value","lands turned","monitoring change","natural areas","natural land","net changes","obtain better","rapid urbanization","sensing imagery","significant change","study found","sustainable development","svm algorithm","svm classifier","tree dt","two decades","two objectives","using classifiers","valuable baseline","environmental management","landsat data","using landsat","change detection","decision tree","machine svm","overall classification","vector machine","classification accuracy","forest rf","support vector","urban planning","random forest","remote sensing"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["adopt appropriate","annual change","annual decrease","appropriate strategies","better understand","better understanding","change continues","change using","classifier methods","compare random","continues regardless","current situation","current study","current trend","decades using","detection algorithm","development drastic","drastic declines","dt classifier","efficient environmental","environmental issues","examine change","frequent human","heterogeneous landscape","human activity","imagery frequent","issues monitoring","kappa value","lands turned","monitoring change","natural areas","natural land","net changes","obtain better","rapid urbanization","sensing imagery","significant change","study found","sustainable development","svm algorithm","svm classifier","tree dt","two decades","two objectives","using classifiers","valuable baseline","decision tree","environmental management","landsat data","using landsat","change detection","machine svm","overall classification","classification accuracy","vector machine","forest rf","support vector","urban planning","random forest","remote sensing"]},{"DocId":54,"Year":2016,"Title":"Building detection from orthophotos using a machine learning approach: An empirical study on image segmentation and descriptors","Abstract":"Building detection from aerial images has many applications in fields like urban planning, real-estate management, and disaster relief. In the last two decades, a large variety of methods on automatic building detection have been proposed in the remote sensing literature. Many of these approaches make use of local features to classify each pixel or segment to an object label, therefore involving an extra step to fuse pixelwise decisions. This paper presents a generic framework that exploits recent advances in image segmentation and region descriptors extraction for the automatic and accurate detection of buildings on aerial orthophotos. The proposed solution is supervised in the sense that appearances of buildings are learnt from examples. For the first time in the context of building detection, we use the matrix covariance descriptor, which proves to be very informative and compact. Moreover, we introduce a principled evaluation that allows selecting the best pair segmentation algorithm-region descriptor for the task of building detection. Finally, we provide a performance evaluation at pixel level using different classifiers. This evaluation is conducted over 200 buildings using different segmentation algorithms and descriptors. The performance analysis quantifies the quality of both the image segmentation and the descriptor used. The proposed approach presents several advantages in terms of scalability, suitability and simplicity with respect to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme (detection chain and evaluation) can be deployed for detecting multiple object categories that are present in images and can be used by intelligent systems requiring scene perception and parsing such as intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle navigation and automatic 3D city modeling. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To realize reliable UAV communications, a fundamental work is to investigate the propagation characteristics of the channels. In this paper, we propose path loss models for the UAV air-to-air (AA) scenario based on machine learning. A ray-tracing software is employed to generate samples for multiple routes in a typical urban environment, and different altitudes of Tx and Rx UAVs are taken into consideration. Two machine-learning algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, are exploited to build prediction models on the basis of the training data. The prediction performance of trained models is assessed on the test set according to the metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, two empirical models are presented for comparison. It is shown that the machine-learning-based models are able to provide high prediction accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency in the AA scenario. Moreover, Random Forest outperforms other models and has the smallest prediction errors. Further investigation is made to evaluate the impacts of five different parameters on the path loss. It is demonstrated that the path visibility is crucial for the path loss. \u00a9 2018 Yan Zhang et al.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["path loss","aa scenario","random forest","acceptable computational","aerial vehicle","algorithms random","build prediction","communications fundamental","consideration two","different altitudes","different parameters","environments recently","five different","forest outperforms","fundamental work","generate samples","high flexibility","high prediction","learning software","low cost","metrics including","multiple routes","path visibility","prediction accuracy","prediction based","prediction errors","prediction models","propagation characteristics","propose path","provide high","realize reliable","recently unmanned","reliable uav","rx uavs","scenario based","set according","smallest prediction","test set","trained models","two algorithms","two empirical","uav aa","uav communications","uav plays","unmanned aerial","vehicle uav","absolute error","computational efficiency","empirical models","error mae","error rmse","important role","loss models","loss prediction","prediction performance","mean absolute","mean square","root mean","square error","typical urban","training data","learning methods","urban environment","machine learning","urban environments"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["path loss","aa scenario","random forest","acceptable computational","aerial vehicle","algorithms random","build prediction","communications fundamental","computational efficiency","consideration two","different altitudes","different parameters","environments recently","five different","forest outperforms","fundamental work","generate samples","high flexibility","high prediction","important role","learning software","low cost","metrics including","multiple routes","path visibility","prediction accuracy","prediction based","prediction errors","prediction models","propagation characteristics","propose path","provide high","realize reliable","recently unmanned","reliable uav","rx uavs","scenario based","set according","smallest prediction","test set","trained models","two algorithms","two empirical","uav aa","uav communications","uav plays","unmanned aerial","vehicle uav","machine learning","absolute error","empirical models","error mae","error rmse","loss models","loss prediction","mean absolute","prediction performance","typical urban","mean square","root mean","square error","training data","learning methods","urban environment","urban environments"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["path loss","aa scenario","random forest","acceptable computational","aerial vehicle","algorithms random","build prediction","communications fundamental","computational efficiency","consideration two","different altitudes","different parameters","environments recently","five different","forest outperforms","fundamental work","generate samples","high flexibility","high prediction","important role","learning software","low cost","metrics including","multiple routes","path visibility","prediction accuracy","prediction based","prediction errors","prediction models","propagation characteristics","propose path","provide high","realize reliable","recently unmanned","reliable uav","rx uavs","scenario based","set according","smallest prediction","test set","trained models","two algorithms","two empirical","uav aa","uav communications","uav plays","unmanned aerial","vehicle uav","machine learning","absolute error","empirical models","error mae","error rmse","loss models","loss prediction","mean absolute","prediction performance","typical urban","mean square","root mean","square error","training data","learning methods","urban environment","urban environments"]},{"DocId":56,"Year":2016,"Title":"A supervoxel-based spectro-spatial approach for 3D urban point cloud labelling","Abstract":"ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) point cloud labelling of airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) data has promising applications in urban city modelling. Automatic and efficient methods for semantic labelling of airborne urban point cloud data with multiple classes still remains a challenge. We propose a novel 3D object-based classification framework for labelling urban lidar point cloud using a computer vision technique, supervoxels. The supervoxel approach is promising for representing dense lidar point cloud in a compact manner for 3D segmentation and for improving the computational efficiency. Initially, supervoxels are generated by over-segmenting the coloured point cloud using the voxel-based cloud connectivity algorithm in the geometric space. The local connectivity established between supervoxels has been used to produce meaningful and realistic objects (segments). The segments are classified by different machine learning techniques based on several spectral and geometric features extracted from the segments. All the points within a labelled segment are assigned the same segment label. Furthermore, the effect of different feature vectors and varying point density on the classification accuracy has been studied. Results indicate an accurate labelling of points in realistic 3D space conforming to the boundaries of objects. An overall classification accuracy of 90% is achieved by the proposed method. The labelled 3D points can be used directly for the reconstruction of buildings and other man-made objects. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["point cloud","cloud labelling","cloud using","urban point","lidar point","classification accuracy","abstract point","accurate labelling","airborne urban","city modelling","cloud connectivity","coloured point","compact manner","computational efficiency","connectivity algorithm","connectivity established","dense lidar","different feature","efficiency initially","efficient methods","feature vectors","geometric space","initially supervoxels","labelled points","labelled segment","labelling abstract","labelling urban","local connectivity","modelling automatic","novel classification","objects segments","point density","produce meaningful","promising applications","ranging data","realistic objects","realistic space","remains challenge","representing dense","segment label","space conforming","studied results","supervoxel approach","technique supervoxels","urban city","urban lidar","using computer","varying point","vision technique","cloud data","features extracted","geometric features","lidar light","multiple classes","techniques based","different machine","overall classification","semantic labelling","propose novel","classification framework","airborne lidar","results indicate","learning techniques","light detection","computer vision","proposed method","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["point cloud","cloud labelling","cloud using","urban point","lidar point","classification accuracy","abstract point","accurate labelling","airborne urban","city modelling","cloud connectivity","coloured point","compact manner","computational efficiency","connectivity algorithm","connectivity established","dense lidar","different feature","efficiency initially","efficient methods","feature vectors","features extracted","geometric space","initially supervoxels","labelled points","labelled segment","labelling abstract","labelling urban","local connectivity","modelling automatic","novel classification","objects segments","point density","produce meaningful","promising applications","ranging data","realistic objects","realistic space","remains challenge","representing dense","segment label","space conforming","studied results","supervoxel approach","technique supervoxels","urban city","urban lidar","using computer","varying point","vision technique","cloud data","geometric features","lidar light","multiple classes","overall classification","techniques based","different machine","semantic labelling","classification framework","propose novel","results indicate","airborne lidar","computer vision","learning techniques","light detection","proposed method","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["point cloud","cloud labelling","cloud using","urban point","lidar point","classification accuracy","abstract point","accurate labelling","airborne urban","city modelling","cloud connectivity","coloured point","compact manner","computational efficiency","connectivity algorithm","connectivity established","dense lidar","different feature","different machine","efficiency initially","efficient methods","feature vectors","features extracted","geometric space","initially supervoxels","labelled points","labelled segment","labelling abstract","labelling urban","local connectivity","modelling automatic","multiple classes","novel classification","objects segments","point density","produce meaningful","promising applications","propose novel","ranging data","realistic objects","realistic space","remains challenge","representing dense","segment label","semantic labelling","space conforming","studied results","supervoxel approach","technique supervoxels","urban city","urban lidar","using computer","varying point","vision technique","classification framework","cloud data","geometric features","lidar light","overall classification","techniques based","airborne lidar","computer vision","light detection","results indicate","learning techniques","proposed method","machine learning"]},{"DocId":57,"Year":2020,"Title":"PSO-ELM: A Hybrid Learning Model for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting","Abstract":"Accurate and reliable traffic flow forecasting is of importance for urban planning and mitigation of traffic congestion, and it is also the basis for the deployment of intelligent traffic management systems.

One way to tackle the problem is to resort to the emerging technologies in artificial intelligence. Traffic light control is one of the most traditional and important instruments for urban traffic management. The present study proposes a traffic light control system enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework in a decentralized manner. In the framework, a traffic network is decomposed into regions represented by region agents. Each region consists of intersections, modeled by intersection agents who coordinate with neighboring intersection agents through communication. For each intersection, a collection of turning movement agents operate individually and implement optimal actions according to local control policies. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm for each turning movement agent, the intersection controllers are enabled with the capability to make their timing decisions in a complex and dynamic environment. In addition, the traffic light control operates with an advanced phase composition process dynamically combining compatible turning movements. Moreover, the collective operations performed by the agents in a road network are further coordinated by varying priority settings for relevant turning movements. A case study was carried out by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed control system while comparing it with an optimized vehicle-actuated control system. The results show that the proposed traffic light system, after a collective machine learning process, not only improves the local signal operations at individual intersections but also enhances the traffic performance at the regional level through coordination of specific turning movements. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["traffic light","turning

With the help of recently emerged street view images and machine learning algorithms, an evaluation model has been trained to assess the perceived visual quality with accuracy similar to that of experienced urban designers, to provide full coverage and detailed results for a citywide area. The town centre of Shanghai was selected for the site. Around 140,000 screenshots from Baidu Street View were processed and a machine learning algorithm, SegNet, was applied to intelligently extract the pixels representing key elements affecting the visual quality of streets, including the building frontage, greenery, sky view, pedestrian space, motorisation, and diversity. A Java-based program was then produced to automatically collect the preferences of experienced urban designers on representative sample images. Another machine learning algorithm, i.e. an artificial neural network, was used to train an evaluation model to achieve a citywide, high-resolution evaluation of the visual quality of the streets. Further validation through different approaches shows this evaluation model obtains a satisfactory accuracy. The results from the artificial neural network also help to explore the high or low effects of various key elements on visual quality. In short, this study contributes to the development of human-centred planning and design by providing continuous measurements of an \u2018unmeasurable\u2019 quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights on the perceptual-based visual quality and detailed mapping of various key elements in streets can assist in more efficient street renewal by providing accurate design guidance. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["visual quality","key elements","evaluation model","artificial neural","experienced urban","various key","urban designers","street view","neural network","learning algorithm","learning algorithms","view images","machine learning","accuracy similar","accurate design","achieve citywide","algorithm segnet","approaches shows","automatically collect","building frontage","citywide area","citywide evaluation","continuous measurement","continuous measurements","design guidance","detailed mapping","detailed results","different approaches","diversity program","efficient street","elements affecting","emerged street","frontage greenery","full coverage","greenery sky","intelligently extract","low effects","measurement based","model obtains","obtains satisfactory","perceived visual","pixels representing","proposes workable","providing accurate","providing continuous","quantitatively measuring","recently emerged","representative sample","representing key","sample images","satisfactory accuracy","sky view","space motorisation","street renewal","streets continuous","streets including","subjective impressions","town centre","unmeasurable quality","view pedestrian","workable approach","baidu street","pedestrian space","provide full","study contributes","study proposes"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["visual quality","key elements","evaluation model","street view","experienced urban","various key","urban designers","learning algorithm","learning algorithms","view images","artificial neural","machine learning","neural network","accuracy similar","accurate design","achieve citywide","algorithm segnet","approaches shows","automatically collect","baidu street","building frontage","citywide area","citywide evaluation","continuous measurement","continuous measurements","design guidance","detailed mapping","detailed results","different approaches","diversity program","efficient street","elements affecting","emerged street","frontage greenery","full coverage","greenery sky","intelligently extract","low effects","measurement based","model obtains","obtains satisfactory","pedestrian space","perceived visual","pixels representing","proposes workable","provide full","providing accurate","providing continuous","quantitatively measuring","recently emerged","representative sample","representing key","sample images","satisfactory accuracy","sky view","space motorisation","street renewal","streets continuous","streets including","study contributes","subjective impressions","town centre","unmeasurable quality","view pedestrian","workable approach","study proposes"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["visual quality","key elements","evaluation model","artificial neural","experienced urban","learning algorithm","learning algorithms","various key","machine learning","street view","urban designers","neural network","view images","accuracy similar","accurate design","achieve citywide","algorithm segnet","approaches shows","automatically collect","baidu street","building frontage","citywide area","citywide evaluation","continuous measurement","continuous measurements","design guidance","detailed mapping","detailed results","different approaches","diversity program","efficient street","elements affecting","emerged street","frontage greenery","full coverage","greenery sky","intelligently extract","low effects","measurement based","model obtains","obtains satisfactory","pedestrian space","perceived visual","pixels representing","proposes workable","provide full","providing accurate","providing continuous","quantitatively measuring","recently emerged","representative sample","representing key","sample images","satisfactory accuracy","sky view","space motorisation","street renewal","streets continuous","streets including","study contributes","subjective impressions","town centre","unmeasurable quality","view pedestrian","workable approach","study proposes"]},{"DocId":63,"Year":2019,"Title":"Support Vector Machine accuracy assessment for extracting green urban areas in towns","Abstract":"The most commonly used model for analyzing satellite imagery is the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

We propose the application of multilabel classification, a powerful framework in machine learning, for inferring the complex relationships between the acquired satellite images and the spectral profiles of different types of surface materials. Introducing a drastically different approach compared to unsupervised spectral unmixing, we employ contemporary ground-collected data from the European Environment Agency to generate the label set and multispectral images from the MODIS sensor to generate the spectral features, under a supervised classification framework. To validate the merits of our approach, we present results using several state-of-the-art multilabel learning classifiers and evaluate their predictive performance with respect to the number of annotated training examples, as well as their capability to exploit examples from neighboring regions or different time instances. We also demonstrate the application of our method on hyperspectral data from the Hyperion sensor for the urban land cover estimation of New York City.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mason bee","microsite conditions","red mason","sun exposure","bee osmia","floral resources","landscape factors","leipzig germany","osmia bicornis","wild bee","artificial nest","attachment position","balanced influence","bicornis hymenoptera","biotope data","buildings provide","cities responds","citizen science","clearly profits","collected information","common wild","conditions dominate","data map","derived landscape","different locations","digital gis","dominate habitat","edge length","eight local","employed citizen","environment case","expected balanced","exposure attachment","exposure cities","flower availability","flower sites","germany volunteers","gis biotope","good environment","habitat selection","hang location","higher sun","housing structure","hung trap","hymenoptera megachilidae","important followed","investigate drivers","landscape structure","local flower","local microsite","map distance","matrix properties","multiple logistic","nearby floral","nesting opportunities","open housing","opportunities artificial","position local","private gardens","provide good","resource distribution","science approach","solitary bee","spatial distribution","suitable nesting","trap nest","trap nests","urban habitat","using combination","volunteers hung","analyzed using","urban area","urban matrix","urban region","logistic regression","results indicate","case study","urban environments","urban environment","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mason bee","microsite conditions","red mason","sun exposure","bee osmia","floral resources","landscape factors","leipzig germany","osmia bicornis","wild bee","analyzed using","artificial nest","attachment position","balanced influence","bicornis hymenoptera","biotope data","buildings provide","cities responds","citizen science","clearly profits","collected information","common wild","conditions dominate","data map","derived landscape","different locations","digital gis","dominate habitat","edge length","eight local","employed citizen","environment case","expected balanced","exposure attachment","exposure cities","flower availability","flower sites","germany volunteers","gis biotope","good environment","habitat selection","hang location","higher sun","housing structure","hung trap","hymenoptera megachilidae","important followed","investigate drivers","landscape structure","local flower","local microsite","logistic regression","map distance","matrix properties","multiple logistic","nearby floral","nesting opportunities","open housing","opportunities artificial","position local","private gardens","provide good","resource distribution","results indicate","science approach","solitary bee","spatial distribution","suitable nesting","trap nest","trap nests","urban habitat","urban matrix","urban region","using combination","volunteers hung","urban area","urban environments","urban environment","case study","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mason bee","microsite conditions","red mason","sun exposure","bee osmia","floral resources","landscape factors","leipzig germany","osmia bicornis","wild bee","analyzed using","artificial nest","attachment position","balanced influence","bicornis hymenoptera","biotope data","buildings provide","cities responds","citizen science","clearly profits","collected information","common wild","conditions dominate","data map","derived landscape","different locations","digital gis","dominate habitat","edge length","eight local","employed citizen","environment case","expected balanced","exposure attachment","exposure cities","flower availability","flower sites","germany volunteers","gis biotope","good environment","habitat selection","hang location","higher sun","housing structure","hung trap","hymenoptera megachilidae","important followed","investigate drivers","landscape structure","local flower","local microsite","logistic regression","map distance","matrix properties","multiple logistic","nearby floral","nesting opportunities","open housing","opportunities artificial","position local","private gardens","provide good","resource distribution","results indicate","science approach","solitary bee","spatial distribution","suitable nesting","trap nest","trap nests","urban habitat","urban matrix","urban region","using combination","volunteers hung","urban area","urban environments","urban environment","case study","machine learning"]},{"DocId":67,"Year":2019,"Title":"Spatial prediction of landslide susceptibility using GIS-based statistical and machine learning models in Wanzhou County, Three Gorges Reservoir, China","Abstract":"Landslide susceptibility mapping is vital for landslide risk management and urban planning.

First, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier geotechnical investigation reports, aerial images, and field surveys. Then, the redundant factors were excluded from the initial fourteen landslide causal factors via factor correlation analysis. To determine the most effective causal factors, landslide susceptibility evaluations were performed based on four cases with different combinations of factors (\u201ccases\u201d). In the analysis, 465 (70%) landslide locations were randomly selected for model training, and 200 (30%) landslide locations were selected for verification.

classifier","Abstract":"Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Forest-a non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km2 in 1972 to 378 km2 in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["growth rate","land cover","classification accuracy","annual growth","urban

developing a soundscape classification model","Abstract":"To ensure appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["classification model","vector machines","support vector","automatic classification","soundscape classification","soundscape evaluation","urban soundscapes","urban soundscape","acoustical categorization","applying support","appropriate soundscape","complexity associated","comprehensive urban","correctly classified","developing model","developing soundscape","ensure appropriate","essential step","evaluation applying","great complexity","instances correctly","machines svm","machines trained","match people","minimal optimization","model achieves","model classification","optimization smo","outstanding performance","people expectations","perceptual criteria","problem two","proposes model","providing basis","sequential minimal","smo algorithm","smo model","sound standpoint","soundscape management","soundscapes based","specific task","svm model","techniques support","two machine","underlying acoustical","widely acknowledged","work proposes","model outperforms","results indicate","urban areas","urban environments","learning techniques","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["classification model","vector machines","support vector","automatic classification","soundscape classification","soundscape evaluation","urban soundscapes","urban soundscape","acoustical categorization","applying support","appropriate soundscape","complexity associated","comprehensive urban","correctly classified","developing model","developing soundscape","ensure appropriate","essential step","evaluation applying","great complexity","instances correctly","machines svm","machines trained","match people","minimal optimization","model achieves","model classification","model outperforms","optimization smo","outstanding performance","people expectations","perceptual criteria","problem two","proposes model","providing basis","results indicate","sequential minimal","smo algorithm","smo model","sound standpoint","soundscape management","soundscapes based","specific task","svm model","techniques support","two machine","underlying acoustical","widely acknowledged","work proposes","urban environments","urban areas","learning techniques","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["classification model","vector machines","support vector","automatic classification","soundscape classification","soundscape evaluation","urban soundscapes","urban soundscape","acoustical categorization","applying support","appropriate soundscape","complexity associated","comprehensive urban","correctly classified","developing model","developing soundscape","ensure appropriate","essential step","evaluation applying","great complexity","instances correctly","machines svm","machines trained","match people","minimal optimization","model achieves","model classification","optimization smo","outstanding performance","people expectations","perceptual criteria","problem two","proposes model","providing basis","sequential minimal","smo algorithm","smo model","sound standpoint","soundscape management","soundscapes based","specific task","svm model","techniques support","two machine","underlying acoustical","urban environments","widely acknowledged","work proposes","model outperforms","results indicate","urban areas","learning techniques","machine learning"]},{"DocId":70,"Year":2014,"Title":"Driving forces analysis of urban expansion based on boosted regression trees and Logistic regression","Abstract":"The rapid relentless urban area expansion has led to a series of problems in China. Many researches focused on this issue in recent years. Driving forces are the core topic in urban expansion,as well as the basic component of modeling and predicting. It is very useful and meaningful to analyze the driving force of urban expansion, which may provide us with a scientific basis to rationally utilize land resources, determining the law of urban development, researching the evolution process, predicting the urban expansion trends, and also providing guidance for the development of rational control policies. The Shenyang city was chosen as study area. Eight categories of land use types were extracted from remote sensing images (1997 and 2010) with ArcGIS software. Ten driving forces were chosen, including three natural factors, three distance factors, four social and economic factors. which were calculated based on the land use maps, DEM, topographic maps, zoning maps and the statistical yearbooks. The dependent variable was the change of built-up area of Shenyang from 1997 to 2010. Boosted regression trees (BRT) is an ensemble method and is a combination of techniques between statistical and machine learning traditions that has shown to be effective to identify relationships between results and influencing factors. Logistic regression is a method to discover the empirical relationships between a binary dependent and several independent categorical and continuous variables. Boosted Regression Trees and Logistic regression were used to analyze the main driving force of urban expansion synthetically. The result illustrated the relative influence of driving factors was followed by distance from urban area of 1997, distance from river, DEM, distance from highway and railway, land use types, development plan, GDP, population density, aspect, and slope based on BRT analysis. According to Logistic regression analysis, the relative influence of important factors was followed by development zone, distance from urban land of 1997, DEM, distance from highway and railway, population density, distance from river, rural residential areas and slope. The most important driving forces affecting the expansion of Shenyang are distance from urban area of 1997, DEM, distance from highway and railway. Meanwhile, they were all located in the top four of the main factors. The results revealed that the distance factors were the most important factors, and the total contribution rate of relative influence was up to 61.4%. It is demonstrated distance factors are the main driving forces of urban expansion. Natural factorswere less important, but the relative influence of DEM was important, and the contribution rate was 12.5%. Development zones and rural settlements are the only two factors have much influence in the socio-economic factors. On the whole, location factors, which refer to the distance from urban land in this study, were the leading factors of urban expansion. Natural factors, such as DEM, rivers and so on, are the basis of urban development, determining the overall urban spatial form. The construction of infrastructures, such as roads and railways, are the frame of the city. The social and economic factors decided the speed of urban expansion. Urban planning and development zone construction provided the direction of urban expansion.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban expansion","driving forces","relative

In recent years, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a research focus in developing new change detection methods. Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are presented, and the available open datasets are also listed.

In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages\/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover\/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields

Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range.

Although a wide range of methods exists for modeling and simulating urban growth, machine learning (ML) techniques have received less attention despite their potential for producing highly accurate predictions of future urban extents. The aim of this study is to investigate two ML techniques, namely radial basis function network (RBFN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, for modeling urban change. By predicting urban change for 2010, the models\u2019 performance is evaluated by comparing results with a reference map and by using a set of pertinent statistical measures, such as average spatial distance deviation and figure of merit. The application of these techniques employs the case study area of Mumbai, India. The results show that both models, which were tested using the same explanatory variables, produced promising results in terms of predicting the size and extent of future urban areas. Although a close match between RBFN and MLP is observed, RBFN demonstrates higher spatial accuracy of prediction. Accordingly, RBFN was utilized to simulate urban change for 2020 and 2030. Overall, the study provides evidence that RBFN is a robust and efficient ML technique and can therefore be recommended for land use change modeling. \u00a9 2015, \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban change","basis function","future urban","radial basis","ml techniques","modeling urban","case study","accordingly rbfn","accurate predictions","average spatial","change case","change spatial","close match","comparing results","demonstrates higher","distance deviation","efficient ml","environment protection","explanatory variables","function network","function networks","growth machine","higher spatial","highly accurate","investigate two","methods exists","ml technique","mlp networks","models performance","mumbai india","network rbfn","observed rbfn","patterns critical","perceptron networks","performance analysis","pertinent statistical","planners decision","prediction accordingly","produced promising","producing highly","promising results","protection activists","provides evidence","rapidly growing","rbfn demonstrates","reference map","spatial accuracy","spatial distance","statistical measures","techniques employs","tested using","two ml","urban extents","using set","variables produced","change modeling","decision makers","perceptron mlp","predicting urban","spatial patterns","study provides","wide range","learning ml","simulate urban","study area","results show","simulating urban","use change","urban planners","urban areas","urban growth","land use","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban change","basis function","future urban","ml techniques","radial basis","modeling urban","case study","accordingly rbfn","accurate predictions","average spatial","change case","change spatial","close match","comparing results","demonstrates higher","distance deviation","efficient ml","environment protection","explanatory variables","function network","function networks","growth machine","higher spatial","highly accurate","investigate two","learning ml","methods exists","ml technique","mlp networks","models performance","mumbai india","network rbfn","observed rbfn","patterns critical","perceptron networks","performance analysis","pertinent statistical","planners decision","prediction accordingly","produced promising","producing highly","promising results","protection activists","provides evidence","rapidly growing","rbfn demonstrates","reference map","spatial accuracy","spatial distance","spatial patterns","statistical measures","techniques employs","tested using","two ml","urban extents","using set","variables produced","wide range","change modeling","decision makers","perceptron mlp","predicting urban","study provides","simulate urban","results show","study area","urban areas","urban planners","simulating urban","use change","urban growth","land use","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban change","basis function","future urban","ml techniques","radial basis","case study","modeling urban","accordingly rbfn","accurate predictions","average spatial","change case","change spatial","close match","comparing results","demonstrates higher","distance deviation","efficient ml","environment protection","explanatory variables","function network","function networks","growth machine","higher spatial","highly accurate","investigate two","learning ml","methods exists","ml technique","mlp networks","models performance","mumbai india","network rbfn","observed rbfn","patterns critical","perceptron mlp","perceptron networks","performance analysis","pertinent statistical","planners decision","prediction accordingly","produced promising","producing highly","promising results","protection activists","provides evidence","rapidly growing","rbfn demonstrates","reference map","spatial accuracy","spatial distance","spatial patterns","statistical measures","study provides","techniques employs","tested using","two ml","urban extents","using set","variables produced","wide range","change modeling","decision makers","predicting urban","urban areas","results show","simulate urban","study area","urban planners","simulating urban","use change","urban growth","land use","machine learning"]},{"DocId":75,"Year":2019,"Title":"Simulation of urban expansion via integrating artificial neural network with Markov chain\u2013cellular automata","Abstract":"Accurate simulations and predictions of urban expansion are critical to manage urbanization and explicitly address the spatiotemporal trends and distributions of urban expansion. Cellular Automata integrated Markov Chain (CA-MC) is one of the most frequently used models for this purpose. However, the urban suitability index (USI) map produced from the conventional CA-MC is either affected by human bias or cannot accurately reflect the possible nonlinear relations between driving factors and urban expansion. To overcome these limitations, a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network, ANN) was integrated with CA-MC instead of the commonly used Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Logistic Regression (LR) CA-MC models. The ANN was optimized to create the USI map and then integrated with CA-MC to spatially allocate urban expansion cells. The validated results of kappa and fuzzy kappa simulation indicate that ANN-CA-MC outperformed other variously coupled CA-MC modelling approaches.

To control and analyse this growth, new and better methods for urban land use mapping are needed. This article proposes a new method for urban land-use mapping, which integrates spatial metrics and texture analysis in an object-based image analysis classification. A high-resolution satellite image was used to generate spatial and texture metrics from the machine learning algorithm of Random Forests landcover classification. The most meaningful spatial indices were selected by visual inspection and then combined with the image and texture values to generate the classification. The proposed method for land-use mapping was tested using a 10-fold crossvalidation scheme, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.3% and a kappa coefficient of 0.896. These steps produced an accurate model of urban land use, without the use of any census or ancillary data, and suggest that the combined use of spatial metrics and texture is promising for urban land-use mapping in developing countries. The maps produced can provide the landuse data needed by urban planners for effective planning in developing countries. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["spatial metrics","urban mapping","developing countries","texture analysis","random forests","urban land","accurate model","analysis classification","analysis rapid","ancillary data","article proposes","better methods","causing great","classification satellite","combined use","crossvalidation scheme","data needed","forests classification","forests landcover","generate spatial","great number","growth new","integrates spatial","integrating spatial","landuse data","mapping integrating","maps produced","meaningful spatial","planning problems","proposes new","rapid urban","scheme achieving","spatial indices","steps produced","tested using","texture metrics","texture values","using crossvalidation","visual inspection","effective planning","kappa coefficient","landcover classification","new method","use mapping","urban planners","land use","classification method","image analysis","satellite image","proposed method","urban growth","learning algorithm","overall accuracy","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["developing countries","spatial metrics","urban mapping","random forests","texture analysis","urban land","land use","accurate model","analysis classification","analysis rapid","ancillary data","article proposes","better methods","causing great","classification satellite","combined use","crossvalidation scheme","data needed","effective planning","forests classification","forests landcover","generate spatial","great number","growth new","integrates spatial","integrating spatial","landuse data","mapping integrating","maps produced","meaningful spatial","new method","planning problems","proposes new","rapid urban","satellite image","scheme achieving","spatial indices","steps produced","tested using","texture metrics","texture values","urban planners","using crossvalidation","visual inspection","classification method","landcover classification","urban growth","use mapping","kappa coefficient","learning algorithm","proposed method","image analysis","overall accuracy","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["spatial metrics","urban mapping","developing countries","random forests","texture analysis","land use","urban land","accurate model","analysis classification","analysis rapid","ancillary data","article proposes","better methods","causing great","classification satellite","combined use","crossvalidation scheme","data needed","effective planning","forests classification","forests landcover","generate spatial","great number","growth new","integrates spatial","integrating spatial","landcover classification","landuse data","mapping integrating","maps produced","meaningful spatial","new method","planning problems","proposes new","rapid urban","scheme achieving","spatial indices","steps produced","tested using","texture metrics","texture values","urban planners","use mapping","using crossvalidation","visual inspection","classification method","kappa coefficient","learning algorithm","satellite image","urban growth","image analysis","overall accuracy","proposed method","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":77,"Year":2010,"Title":"Urban land cover and land use classification of an informal settlement area using the open-source knowledge-based system InterIMAGE","Abstract":"This study uses the InterIMAGE system and imagery from the Quick Bird sensor for land cover and land use classification at two test sites with informal settlements in the metropolis of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

Conventional LOS\/MP\/NLOS classifiers, referred to as national marine electronics association (NMEA)-level and receiver independent exchange format (RINEX)-level classifiers, are usually performed using attributes extracted from basic observables or measurements such as received signal strength, satellite elevation angle, code pseudorange, etc. The NMEA\/RINEX-level classification rate is limited because the complex signal propagation in urban environment is not fully manifested in these end attributes. In this paper, LOS\/MP\/NLOS features were extracted at the baseband signal processing stage. Multicorrelator is implemented in a GPS software-defined receiver (SDR) and exploited to generate features from the autocorrelation function (ACF). A robust LOS\/MP\/NLOS classifier using a supervised machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), is then trained. It is also proposed that the Skymask and code pseudorange double difference observable are used to label the real signal type. Raw GPS intermediate frequency data were collected in urban areas in Hong Kong and were postprocessed using a self-developed SDR, which can easily output correlator-level LOS\/MP\/NLOS features. The SDR measurements were saved in the file with the format of NMEA and RINEX. A fair comparison among NMEA-, RINEX-, and correlator-level classifiers was then carried out on a common ground. Results show that the correlator-level classifier improves the metric of F1 score by about 25% over the conventional NMEA- and RINEX-level classifiers for testing data collected at different places to that of training data. In addition to this finding, correlator-level classifier is found to be more feasible in practical applications due to its less dependency on surrounding scenarios compared with theNMEA\/RINEX-level classifiers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["code pseudorange","urban environment","acf robust","algorithm support","angle code","applications

In fact, deep learning acts as a set of mathematical transformations, encoding the raw input data into appropriate forms of representations that maximize the classification performance. However, it is clear that mathematical computations alone, even highly nonlinear, are not adequate to model the physical properties of a problem, distinguishing, for example, the building structures from vegetation. In this letter, we address this difficulty by augmenting the raw LiDAR data with features coming from a physical interpretation of the information. Then, we exploit a deep learning paradigm based on a convolutional neural network model to find out the best input representations suitable for the classification.

With the rise of ubiquitous computing, there is the opportunity to improve such models with data that make for better proxies of human presence in cities. In this paper, we leverage large human mobility data to craft an extensive set of features for crime prediction, as informed by theories in criminology and urban studies. We employ averaging and boosting ensemble techniques from machine learning, to investigate their power in predicting yearly counts for different types of crimes occurring in New York City at census tract level. Our study shows that spatial and spatio-temporal features derived from Foursquare venues and checkins, subway rides, and taxi rides, improve the baseline models relying on census and POI data. The proposed models achieve absolute R2 metrics of up to 65% (on a geographical out-of-sample test set) and up to 89% (on a temporal out-of-sample test set). This proves that, next to the residential population of an area, the ambient population there is strongly predictive of the area\u2019s crime levels. We deep-dive into the main crime categories, and find that the predictive gain of the human dynamics features varies across crime types: such features bring the biggest boost in case of grand larcenies, whereas assaults are already well predicted by the census features.

Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R2 = 0.36\u20130.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R2 = 0.68\u20130.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dense heterogeneous","heterogeneous urban","sensor performance","air quality","urban environment","reference instrument","quality monitoring","urban environments","gradient boosting","using machine","adequately evaluated","aerosol monitor","aerosol monitors","available meteorological","boosting regression","calibration approach","calibration campaign","catalyzed growing","complex urban","describe urban","device calibration","environments air","evaluation studies","field calibration","field evaluation","greater attention","growing body","important considerations","improve device","improve overall","improved quality","incorporates publicly","increased availability","instrument using","monitoring platform","new sensing","novel calibration","numerous laboratory","overall sensor","platform based","present novel","publicly available","quality monitors","received greater","regression gradient","respiratory illnesses","sensing technologies","serious respiratory","shinyei aerosol","significant variation","tree model","unprecedented levels","using gradient","using linear","weather conditions","approach using","boosting model","meteorological data","monitoring devices","new york","significantly improve","york city","developing countries","learning techniques","regression tree","air pollution","learning method","linear regression","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dense heterogeneous","heterogeneous urban","sensor performance","air quality","urban environment","reference instrument","quality monitoring","urban environments","gradient boosting","using machine","adequately evaluated","aerosol monitor","aerosol monitors","approach using","available meteorological","boosting regression","calibration approach","calibration campaign","catalyzed growing","complex urban","describe urban","developing countries","device calibration","environments air","evaluation studies","field calibration","field evaluation","greater attention","growing body","important considerations","improve device","improve overall","improved quality","incorporates publicly","increased availability","instrument using","meteorological data","monitoring platform","new sensing","new york","novel calibration","numerous laboratory","overall sensor","platform based","present novel","publicly available","quality monitors","received greater","regression gradient","regression tree","respiratory illnesses","sensing technologies","serious respiratory","shinyei aerosol","significant variation","significantly improve","tree model","unprecedented levels","using gradient","using linear","weather conditions","york city","boosting model","learning techniques","monitoring devices","air pollution","learning method","machine learning","linear regression"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dense heterogeneous","heterogeneous urban","sensor performance","urban environment","air quality","reference instrument","quality monitoring","urban environments","gradient boosting","using machine","adequately evaluated","aerosol monitor","aerosol monitors","approach using","available meteorological","boosting model","boosting regression","calibration approach","calibration campaign","catalyzed growing","complex urban","describe urban","developing countries","device calibration","environments air","evaluation studies","field calibration","field evaluation","greater attention","growing body","important considerations","improve device","improve overall","improved quality","incorporates publicly","increased availability","instrument using","learning techniques","meteorological data","monitoring platform","new sensing","new york","novel calibration","numerous laboratory","overall sensor","platform based","present novel","publicly available","quality monitors","received greater","regression gradient","regression tree","respiratory illnesses","sensing technologies","serious respiratory","shinyei aerosol","significant variation","significantly improve","tree model","unprecedented levels","using gradient","using linear","weather conditions","york city","learning method","monitoring devices","machine learning","air pollution","linear regression"]},{"DocId":84,"Year":2016,"Title":"Modeling Urban Land Use Changes Using Support Vector Machines","Abstract":"Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning (ML) algorithm commonly applied to the classification of remotely sensing data and more recently for modeling land use changes.

We take full advantage of the benefits of new technology, but also clarify that city is not a machine, also cannot fully mechanically control the urban development. This study presents a methodology for identifying low-carbon travel block, which can be used to identify the built environment conducive to residents\u2019 low-carbon travel. We chose the four elements of traffic survey\u2014travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency\u2014as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from \u201cWeChat,\u201d a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects\u2014land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types\u2019 building area should be \u201c4:1\u20133:1\u201d; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350\u2013450\u00a0m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15\u201320%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150\u00a0m is 40\u201350%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50\u00a0m is 45\u201360%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100\u00a0m is 50\u201370%. The results confirm that \u201cfunctional mixing\u201d and \u201cdense road network\u201d are beneficial to residents\u2019 low-carbon travel proposed by the predecessors. At the same time, we found that not the higher volume rate is, the more favorable for low-carbon travel. Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system. It is not that the higher the bus station coverage is, the better for residents to travel as low-carbon, and the high popularity of public transportation in small cities will increase the carbon emission of residents.

environment using machine learning","Abstract":"To help create a comfortable and healthy indoor and outdoor environment in which to live, there is a need to understand turbulent air flows within the urban environment. To this end, building on a previously reported method [1], we develop a fast-running Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Model (NIROM) for predicting the turbulent air flows found within an urban environment. To resolve larger scale turbulent fluctuations, we employ a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and solve the resulting computational model on unstructured meshes. The objective is to construct a rapid-running NIROM from these results that will have \u2018similar\u2019 dynamics to the original LES model. Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and machine learning techniques, this Reduced Order Model (ROM) is six orders of magnitude faster than the high-fidelity LES model and we demonstrate how \u2018similar\u2019 it can be to the high-fidelity model by comparing statistical quantities such as the mean flows, Reynolds stresses and probability densities of the velocities. We also include validation of the high-fidelity model against data from wind tunnel experiments.

This study used the ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and random forest regression (RF) to distinguish the relative contributions of urban form metrics on LST at three observation scales. Results of this study indicate that more than 90% of the LST variations were explained by selected urban form metrics using RF. Effects of the magnitude and direction of urban form metrics on LST varied with the changes of seasons and observation scales. Overall, building morphology and urban ecological infrastructure had dominant effects on LST variations in high-density urban centers. Urban green space and water bodies demonstrated stronger cooling effects, especially in summer. Building density (BD) exhibited significant positive effects on LST, whereas the floor area ratio (FAR) showed a negative influence on LST.

The supervised image classification method was used to determine the historical LULC changes based on Landsat 1 MSS 1972, Landsat 5 TM 1984, Landsat 7 ETM + 2000, and Landsat 8 OLI TIRS 2014. The future LULC change was predicted using the machine-learning approaches of Land Change Modeler (LCM). The LULC change detection analysis exhibited significant increment in the areal extent of the cropland and urban areas, and decreasing trends in the pasture, forests and shrubland coverage. Mainly, the LULC change matrices indicated that larger conversion rate was observed from shrubland to cropland area. The urban area found to increase by 606.2% from the year 1972 to 2014 and cropland has also increased by 47.3%.

Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street greenery","accessed street","daily accessed","visible street","housing price","housing prices","new urban","urban data","analytical tools","behavioral phenomena","certain radius","city center","closest facilities","combined assessment","ecological psychological","economic effect","economic performance","effects previously","facilities density","features distances","five features","forty variables","fully studied","geographical information","global scale","greenery making","greening policy","hedonic pricing","hold significant","important issue","massive number","mature real","measuring economic","neighborhood features","new analytical","people daily","positive coefficients","potential economic","previously discovered","price measuring","prices visible","pricing model","private neighborhoods","protective effects","provides scientific","quality focusing","quantitative measuring","quantitative support","radius housing","regression coefficient","scale hold","significant positive","street accessibility","street hedonic","tools shanghai","urban greening","baidu street","daily lives","decision makers","estate market","information system","space syntax","study provides","real estate","results show","view images","urban planners","street view"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street greenery","accessed street","daily accessed","visible street","housing price","housing prices","urban data","new urban","analytical tools","baidu street","behavioral phenomena","certain radius","city center","closest facilities","combined assessment","decision makers","ecological psychological","economic effect","economic performance","effects previously","estate market","facilities density","features distances","five features","forty variables","fully studied","geographical information","global scale","greenery making","greening policy","hedonic pricing","hold significant","important issue","information system","massive number","mature real","measuring economic","neighborhood features","new analytical","people daily","positive coefficients","potential economic","previously discovered","price measuring","prices visible","pricing model","private neighborhoods","protective effects","provides scientific","quality focusing","quantitative measuring","quantitative support","radius housing","regression coefficient","scale hold","significant positive","street accessibility","street hedonic","tools shanghai","urban greening","daily lives","real estate","space syntax","study provides","view images","results show","urban planners","street view"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street greenery","accessed street","daily accessed","visible street","housing price","housing prices","new urban","urban data","analytical tools","baidu street","behavioral phenomena","certain radius","city center","closest facilities","combined assessment","daily lives","decision makers","ecological psychological","economic effect","economic performance","effects previously","estate market","facilities density","features distances","five features","forty variables","fully studied","geographical information","global scale","greenery making","greening policy","hedonic pricing","hold significant","important issue","information system","massive number","mature real","measuring economic","neighborhood features","new analytical","people daily","positive coefficients","potential economic","previously discovered","price measuring","prices visible","pricing model","private neighborhoods","protective effects","provides scientific","quality focusing","quantitative measuring","quantitative support","radius housing","real estate","regression coefficient","scale hold","significant positive","space syntax","street accessibility","street hedonic","street view","tools shanghai","urban greening","view images","study provides","urban planners","results show"]},{"DocId":92,"Year":2015,"Title":"Cyber Cities: Social Media as a Tool for Understanding Cities","Abstract":"\u2018Big\u2019 urban data are increasingly becoming accessible for scientific research and policy use.

Yet thorough investigations into how three-dimensional (3D) architectural patterns influence urban thermal conditions collectively and individually are limited. This study bridges this gap by adopting a machine learning method, boosted regression tree (BRT), to analyze the relative influences and marginal effects of 3D urban architecture on land surface temperature (LST). Ten architectural metrics are incorporated to describe the composition and configuration of 3D architectural patterns at a neighborhood scale in the typical megacity of Shanghai. The results show that in summer, the building coverage ratio (BCR), mean architecture height (MAH), mean architecture height standard deviation (AHSD) and mean architecture projection area (MAPA) are the most influential factors, with relative contributions of 39.3%, 16.5%, 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively. The regulation amplitudes (\u0394T) of the dominant metrics for the neighborhood average LST temperature are 2.7 \u00b0C, 0.9 \u00b0C, 0.6 \u00b0C, and 0.6 \u00b0C, respectively. Moreover, with the LST, the BCR exhibits a monotonic positive correlation, the MAH and AHSD show a stepwise negative correlation, and the MAPA shows a combination of positive and negative correlation. It is generally recommended to decrease the development intensity and architectural base area, while increase the building height and roughness to improve the urban thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale. The dominant contributors and related marginal effects are generally consistent across different seasons. These findings can provide quantitative insights for mitigating the LST effects via rational design and management of 3D architectural patterns. Given the distinctive insights provided, the BRT method is recommended for disentangling the relationship between LST and environmental variables in upcoming studies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier

in central China","Abstract":"Numerous machine learning-based land change models have been presented by researchers over the last two decades. To date, however, far less have simulated multiple land use classes and specific land use subclasses at the same time. In some areas of the world, it is important to simulate both of these dynamics to understand fully the drivers and consequences of land change. One important example is the process of urbanization in China, as urban policies have been developed that guide urban expansion, rural protections, and urban subclass development. This paper presents a new model integrating geographic information systems (GIS) with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict multiple transitions among land use types and urban subclasses in the Zhanggong District of Ganzhou city in China. We show that the model produces satisfactory goodness of fit values-based on location, quantity and spatial configuration-between simulated and observed land use maps for 2015. Our simulated future maps produced by the model for 2020 and 2025 demonstrate that transitions from farmland and forest to urban will remain the main pathway of urbanization although we predict that the rate will slow after 2025. The goals of urban planning should be aligned with land use planning according to \u201cCombining multiple laws and regulations\u201d in China. Taking into account the current and future land use transitions will enhance the accuracy and timeliness of land use policy making and urban land planning. For the sustainable land use in Zhanggong District, we argue for a strengthened regulation of the land market by government and believe that planning officials should guide the spatial distribution of land supply actively. Furthermore, improving the production, living and ecological functions of land resources are the key points to optimize urban land use functions and the allocation of land resources. We discuss how our model can be adapted to other areas to benefit land use management and urban planning in China. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","zhanggong district","use transitions","land resources","multiple land","land change","urban land","urban planning","benefit land","central china","change models","china numerous","china taking","combining multiple","ecological functions","expansion rural","future maps","ganzhou city","guide urban","important example","integrating geographic","key points","land market","land supply","location quantity","machine land","main pathway","maps produced","model produces","multiple laws","multiple transitions","new model","numerous machine","observed land","optimize urban","planning according","planning officials","policy making","predict multiple","predicting multiple","produces satisfactory","production living","rural protections","satisfactory goodness","simulated future","simulated multiple","spatial distribution","spatial simulated","specific land","strengthened regulation","subclass development","supply actively","sustainable land","systems gis","understand fully","urban policies","urban subclass","urban subclasses","use classes","use functions","use management","use maps","use policy","use subclasses","use types","future land","model integrating","networks anns","presents new","two decades","geographic information","information systems","land management","land planning","rapid urbanization","use planning","neural networks","paper presents","urban expansion","artificial neural"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","zhanggong district","use transitions","multiple land","land resources","land change","urban land","urban planning","benefit land","central china","change models","china numerous","china taking","combining multiple","ecological functions","expansion rural","future maps","ganzhou city","geographic information","guide urban","important example","integrating geographic","key points","land market","land supply","location quantity","machine land","main pathway","maps produced","model produces","multiple laws","multiple transitions","new model","numerous machine","observed land","optimize urban","planning according","planning officials","predict multiple","predicting multiple","produces satisfactory","production living","rural protections","satisfactory goodness","simulated future","simulated multiple","spatial distribution","spatial simulated","specific land","strengthened regulation","subclass development","supply actively","sustainable land","systems gis","two decades","understand fully","urban policies","urban subclass","urban subclasses","use classes","use functions","use management","use policy","use subclasses","future land","information systems","model integrating","networks anns","neural networks","policy making","presents new","use maps","use planning","use types","land management","land planning","rapid urbanization","paper presents","urban expansion","artificial neural"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","zhanggong district","land resources","use transitions","multiple land","land change","urban planning","urban land","benefit land","central china","change models","china numerous","china taking","combining multiple","ecological functions","expansion rural","future maps","ganzhou city","geographic information","guide urban","important example","integrating geographic","key points","land market","land supply","location quantity","machine land","main pathway","maps produced","model produces","multiple laws","multiple transitions","new model","numerous machine","observed land","optimize urban","planning according","planning officials","policy making","predict multiple","predicting multiple","produces satisfactory","production living","rapid urbanization","rural protections","satisfactory goodness","simulated future","simulated multiple","spatial distribution","spatial simulated","specific land","strengthened regulation","subclass development","supply actively","sustainable land","systems gis","two decades","understand fully","urban policies","urban subclass","urban subclasses","use classes","use functions","use management","use maps","use policy","use subclasses","use types","future land","information systems","model integrating","networks anns","presents new","use planning","land management","land planning","neural networks","paper presents","urban expansion","artificial neural"]},{"DocId":97,"Year":2018,"Title":"Quantifying place: Analyzing the drivers of pedestrian activity in dense urban environments","Abstract":"Understanding pedestrian behavior is critical for many aspects of city planning, design, and management, including transportation, public health, emergency response, and economic development.

We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial\u2013temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year.

Xiamen City","Abstract":"Cities are centers of political, economic, cultural and social life. It is a symbol of human civilization and development, and urbanization is a common trend in many countries. Nowadays, world urbanization accelerates greatly, especially in developing countries. While providing great economic and social benefits, urbanization has also created some environmental problems, including the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI has deep impacts on material cycles and energy transfers within urban ecosystems, and has become an important issue in urban climate and environmental research. Xiamen is one of the special economic zones, and its rapid urbanization induced the UHI becoming much more intense and extensive. To study UHI from a viewpoint of landscape is a new method in urban thermal environment research. Analyzing the dynamics of the urban thermal landscape in the context of urbanization will provide support for environmental protection, energy use policy making, and urban planning and management. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of urban thermal landscape pattern in the main area of Xiamen City. Firstly, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal images, which were acquired on similar dates in the winter of 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007, were used to retrieve brightness temperature. Then a relative brightness temperature (R) was calculated and the thermal patches were classified into 6 grades by temperature difference. Landscape metrics were used here at both landscape and class level to quantify changes in the urban thermal landscape pattern. And they can describe the changes of thermal landscape pattern in 3 aspects, including quantity, shape and structure. Finally, we investigated the distribution of thermal pollution sources in Xiamen. The results showed that: 1) In terms of quantity, with the rapid urbanization of Xiamen City between 1987 and 2007, the thermal landscape became more fragmented, and was more and more dominated by high-grade thermal landscape patches. 2) The shape of high-grade thermal patches even the whole landscape tends to complex. 3) For structure, each grade of thermal landscape became well-distributed and even. The new high-grade thermal patches were found close to the old ones that induced the proximity index (PROX_MN) of high-grade thermal patches increased; the aggregation index (AI) of the whole landscape decreased while the high-grade thermal patches increased; the contagion index (CONTAG) of the whole landscape also decreased so that dominance of high-grade thermal patches gradually increased. 4) The area of thermal patches which converted from low-grade to high-grade is bigger than the area converted from high-grade to low- grade. According to statistical analysis, we found that it is much easier that the high-grade thermal landscape patches converted into the middle-grade thermal landscape than converted among high grades. 5) The high-grade thermal patches mainly distributed in the industry area, and they were increased remarkably. All the high-grade thermal patches experienced three kinds of changes (increasing number, expanding area and increasing grade), and grouped into five high temperature zones (Haicang, Xinyang, Xinglin, seaport of Xiamen island and airport), especially in the industrial districts of Xinyang and Xinglin.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["thermal landscape","thermal patches","landscape

using deep learning: A case study of metropolitan China","Abstract":"China, with the world's largest population, has gone through rapid development in the last forty years and now has over 800 million urban citizens. Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400\u20131,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48\u00d748 corresponding to 480\u00d7480 m2) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10\u00d710) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32\u00d732 to 64\u00d764 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application. \u00a9 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

road centerlines extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery","Abstract":"Accurate road extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery has many applications such as urban planning and vehicle navigation system. The common road extraction methods are based on classification algorithm, which needs to design robust handcrafted features for road. However, designing such features is difficult. For the road centerlines extraction problem, the existing algorithms have some limitations, such as spurs, time consuming. To address the above issues to some extent, we introduce the feature learning based on deep learning to extract robust features automatically, and present a method to extract road centerlines based on multiscale Gabor filters and multiple directional non-maximum suppression. The proposed algorithm consists of the following four steps. Firstly, the aerial imagery is classified by a pixel-wise classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, CNN is used to learn features from raw data automatically, especially the structural features. Then, edge-preserving filtering is conducted on the resulting classification map, with the original imagery serving as the guidance image. It is exploited to preserve the edges and the details of the road. After that, we do some post-processing based on shape features to extract more reliable roads. Finally, multiscale Gabor filters and multiple directional non-maximum suppression are integrated to get a complete and accurate road network. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve comparable or higher quantitative results, as well as more satisfactory visual performance. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["road centerlines","aerial imagery","accurate road","centerlines extraction","directional suppression","gabor filters","multiple directional","multiscale gabor","road extraction","achieve comparable","algorithm consists","automatically especially","centerlines based","classification map","classifier based","cnn specifically","common road","design robust","extract road","extract robust","extraction problem","features automatically","finally multiscale","following four","four steps","get complete","guidance image","handcrafted features","higher quantitative","imagery accurate","imagery serving","learn features","multiscale road","navigation system","network experimental","original imagery","present method","quantitative results","reliable roads","roads finally","robust handcrafted","satisfactory visual","specifically cnn","spurs time","steps firstly","structural features","visual performance","classification algorithm","data automatically","existing algorithms","extraction methods","proposed algorithm","resulting classification","robust features","shape features","feature learning","learning based","raw data","road network","time consuming","vehicle navigation","network cnn","experimental results","results show","proposed method","convolutional neural","neural network","deep learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["road centerlines","aerial imagery","accurate road","centerlines extraction","directional suppression","gabor filters","multiple directional","multiscale gabor","road extraction","achieve comparable","algorithm consists","automatically especially","centerlines based","classification map","classifier based","cnn specifically","common road","design robust","extract road","extract robust","extraction problem","features automatically","finally multiscale","following four","four steps","get complete","guidance image","handcrafted features","higher quantitative","imagery accurate","imagery serving","learn features","multiscale road","navigation system","network experimental","original imagery","present method","quantitative results","reliable roads","roads finally","robust handcrafted","satisfactory visual","specifically cnn","spurs time","steps firstly","structural features","visual performance","classification algorithm","data automatically","existing algorithms","extraction methods","proposed algorithm","resulting classification","robust features","shape features","feature learning","learning based","raw data","road network","time consuming","vehicle navigation","network cnn","experimental results","results show","proposed method","convolutional neural","neural network","deep learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["road centerlines","aerial imagery","accurate road","centerlines extraction","directional suppression","gabor filters","multiple directional","multiscale gabor","road extraction","achieve comparable","algorithm consists","automatically especially","centerlines based","classification map","classifier based","cnn specifically","common road","design robust","extract road","extract robust","extraction problem","features automatically","finally multiscale","following four","four steps","get complete","guidance image","handcrafted features","higher quantitative","imagery accurate","imagery serving","learn features","multiscale road","navigation system","network experimental","original imagery","present method","quantitative results","reliable roads","roads finally","robust features","robust handcrafted","satisfactory visual","specifically cnn","spurs time","steps firstly","structural features","visual performance","classification algorithm","data automatically","existing algorithms","extraction methods","feature learning","network cnn","proposed algorithm","raw data","resulting classification","road network","shape features","time consuming","vehicle navigation","learning based","proposed method","results show","neural network","convolutional neural","experimental results","deep learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":101,"Year":2019,"Title":"Identifying urban geometric types as energy performance patterns","Abstract":"This paper aims to find the impact of geometric parameters on the energy performance of buildings, to using them to identify types regarding major geometric characteristics of a target area. Conventional approaches to control energy efficiency of buildings mainly focus on materials and capacity of insulation, but rarely consider urban and building geometries. By examining energy impacts on urban blocks by urban geometric forms, this paper seeks to identify urban geometric types and energy patterns on urban blocks. To achieve the aims of this study, this paper follows two steps: First, significant indicators for analyzing energy performance are identified in urban geometries; second, the types that capture urban geometry of a real city are categorized. As a result, as a reference for urban planning and design, the paper identifies 13 types that represent the characteristics of urban geometries regarding energy performance. The geometric indicators are carefully measured and their significance to energy performance of buildings is examined through regression analysis. According to these indicators, the 13 types are categorized using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, a machine learning method. Additionally, the 13 types are discussed for implementation as references in urban planning and design, particularly in block planning for a city. \u00a9 2018 International Energy Initiative","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["energy performance","urban geometric","geometric types","urban blocks","urban geometries","analysis according","analyzing energy","area conventional","block planning","building geometries","buildings mainly","capture urban","carefully measured","categorized using","clustering algorithm","consider urban","control energy","conventional approaches","design particularly","energy impacts","energy patterns","examining energy","follows two","geometric characteristics","geometric indicators","geometric parameters","geometries regarding","hierarchical clustering","identifies types","identify types","identify urban","identifying urban","mainly focus","major geometric","method additionally","paper follows","paper identifies","paper seeks","performance patterns","rarely consider","real city","regarding energy","regarding major","regression analysis","significant indicators","target area","two steps","types regarding","using hierarchical","algorithm machine","geometric forms","paper aims","urban geometry","energy efficiency","urban planning","learning method","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["energy performance","urban geometric","geometric types","urban blocks","urban geometries","urban planning","algorithm machine","analysis according","analyzing energy","area conventional","block planning","building geometries","buildings mainly","capture urban","carefully measured","categorized using","clustering algorithm","consider urban","control energy","conventional approaches","design particularly","energy impacts","energy patterns","examining energy","follows two","geometric characteristics","geometric forms","geometric indicators","geometric parameters","geometries regarding","hierarchical clustering","identifies types","identify types","identify urban","identifying urban","learning method","mainly focus","major geometric","method additionally","paper follows","paper identifies","paper seeks","performance patterns","rarely consider","real city","regarding energy","regarding major","regression analysis","significant indicators","target area","two steps","types regarding","urban geometry","using hierarchical","paper aims","energy efficiency","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["energy performance","urban geometric","geometric types","urban blocks","urban geometries","urban planning","algorithm machine","analysis according","analyzing energy","area conventional","block planning","building geometries","buildings mainly","capture urban","carefully measured","categorized using","clustering algorithm","consider urban","control energy","conventional approaches","design particularly","energy impacts","energy patterns","examining energy","follows two","geometric characteristics","geometric forms","geometric indicators","geometric parameters","geometries regarding","hierarchical clustering","identifies types","identify types","identify urban","identifying urban","mainly focus","major geometric","method additionally","paper follows","paper identifies","paper seeks","performance patterns","rarely consider","real city","regarding energy","regarding major","regression analysis","significant indicators","target area","two steps","types regarding","urban geometry","using hierarchical","learning method","paper aims","energy efficiency","machine learning"]},{"DocId":102,"Year":2015,"Title":"Automatic classification of high resolution land cover using a new data weighting procedure: The combination of k-means clustering algorithm and central tendency measures (KMC-CTM)","Abstract":"Information on a well-scale urban land cover is important for a number of urban planning practices involving tree shade mapping, green space analysis, urban hydrologic modeling and urban land use mapping. In this study, an urban land cover dataset received from the database of UCI (University of California at Irvine) machine learning was used as the urban land cover data. This dataset is the urban area located in Deerfield Beach, FL, USA. Separately, this dataset is a high definition atmospheric image consisting of 9 different urban land covers. The characteristics of a multi-scale spectral, magnitude and formal tectology were used to sort out and classify these different images. The dataset comprises a total of 147 features and land covers of 9 different areas involving trees, grass, soil, concrete, asphalt, buildings, cars, pools and shadows. A new data weighting method was recommended to classify these 9 different patterns automatically. This recommended data weighting method is based on the combination of the measures of central tendency composed of mean value, harmonic value, mode and median along with the k-means clustering method. In the data weighting method, the data sets belonging to each class within the dataset are first calculated by using k-means clustering method, after which the measures of central tendency belonging to each class are calculated, as well. The measure of central tendency belonging to each class is divided by the set central value belonging to the class in question, as the result of which the data weight coefficient of that class has already been calculated. This calculation process is performed separately for 9 different land covers, and afterwards, these data weighting coefficients found are multiplied by the dataset, and thus, the dataset has been weighted. In the second stage, on the other hand, 3 different classification algorithms containing k-NN (k-nearest neighbor), extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to classify 9 different urban land covers after the data weighting method. In determining the educational and test data sets, the 10-fold cross validation was used. When classification through raw data was performed along with k-NN (for k = 1), ELM and SVM classification algorithms, the overall classification accuracy obtained was 77.15%, 84.70% and 84.79%, respectively. When classification through data weighting method (the combination of k-means clustering and mode measure) along with k-NN (for k = 1), ELM and SVM classification algorithms was made, the overall classification accuracy obtained proved to be 98.58%, 98.62% and 98.77%, respectively. The obtained results suggest that the urban land cover in an atmospheric image via the recommended data weighting method was classified as 9 different areas with a high classification success rate. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

used for healing purposes with decision tree learning","Abstract":"In 2002, Medicare health insurance recognized the relationship between pedestrian environments and public health by providing co-pay for health care delivered in residential land use. In this multi-disciplinary experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA) bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical activity levels with the associated health benefits. A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area. A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of individual or group of these variables to better understand how the built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes. This collaboration was our first phase in developing intelligent tools for designers that provided site-specific user-specific data to the planner or designer of pedestrian space.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["health purposes","analytical model","pedestrian landscapes","walking environments","decision tree","critical variables","grass

urban land use change by integrating a convolutional neural network with vector-based cellular automata","Abstract":"Vector-based cellular automata (VCA) models have been applied in land use change simulations at fine scales. However, the neighborhood effects of the driving factors are rarely considered in the exploration of the transition suitability of cells, leading to lower simulation accuracy. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-VCA model that adopts the CNN to extract the high-level features of the driving factors within a neighborhood of an irregularly shaped cell and discover the relationships between multiple land use changes and driving factors at the neighborhood level. The proposed model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China. Compared with several VCA models using other machine learning methods, the proposed CNN-VCA model obtained the highest simulation accuracy (figure-of-merit\u00a0=\u00a00.361). The results indicated that the CNN-VCA model can effectively uncover the neighborhood effects of multiple driving factors on the developmental potential of land parcels and obtain more details on the morphological characteristics of land parcels.

In recent years, machine learning based algorithms, such as support vector machines, decision trees, ensemble learning, and their variations have shown promising results in HSI analysis. Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to insufficient information abstraction in interpreting hyperspectral pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based classification algorithm, named Progressively Expanded Neural Network (PEN Net), that can effectively interpret hyperspectral pixels in nonlinear feature spaces and then determine their categories. Furthermore, a spectral-spatial HSI classification framework is also introduced to test the generality and robustness of the PEN Net. Experimental results on four standard hyperspectral datasets illustrate that: (1) PEN Net classifier yields better accuracy and competitive processing speed in HSI classification tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods; (2) Multi-hidden layer based PEN Net generally provides better performance than single hidden layer one; (3) Combination of spectral and spatial features in the PEN Net classifier can significantly improve the classification accuracy by 6\u201315% compared to the spectral only based HSI classification.

Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems are conventional methods for vehicle detection and travel times estimation. However, such systems are specifically focused on car plates, providing a limited extent of road users. The advance of open-source deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) in combination with freely-available closed-circuit television (CCTV) datasets have offered the opportunities for detection and classification of various road users. The research, presented here, aims to analyse traffic flow patterns through fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models on domain-specific low quality imagery, as captured in various weather conditions and seasons of the year 2018. Such imagery is collected from the North East Combined Authority (NECA) Travel and Transport Data, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. Results show that the fine-tuned MobileNet model with 98.2% precision, 58.5% recall and 73.4% harmonic mean could potentially be used for a real time traffic monitoring application with big data, due to its fast performance. Compared to MobileNet, the fine-tuned Faster region proposal R-CNN model, providing a better harmonic mean (80.4%), recall (68.8%) and more accurate estimations of car units, could be used for traffic analysis applications that demand higher accuracy than speed.

urban location","Abstract":"While urban systems demonstrate high spatial heterogeneity, many urban planning, economic and political decisions heavily rely on a deep understanding of local neighborhood contexts. We show that the structure of 311 Service Requests enables one possible way of building a unique signature of the local urban context, thus being able to serve as a low-cost decision support tool for urban stakeholders. Considering examples of New York City, Boston and Chicago, we demonstrate how 311 Service Requests recorded and categorized by type in each neighborhood can be utilized to generate a meaningful classification of locations across the city, based on distinctive socioeconomic profiles. Moreover, the 311-based classification of urban neighborhoods can present sufficient information to model various socioeconomic features. Finally, we show that these characteristics are capable of predicting future trends in comparative local real estate prices. We demonstrate 311 Service Requests data can be used to monitor and predict socioeconomic performance of urban neighborhoods, allowing urban stakeholders to quantify the impacts of their interventions. \u00a9 2017 Wang et al.

In this context, multitemporal (MT) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have not been equally investigated, as compared to optical satellite data. This research compared various machine learning methods using single-date and MT Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery. The research was focused on vegetation mapping in urban areas across Europe. Urban vegetation was classified using six classifiers-random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost. M1 (AB), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Whereas, SVM showed the best performance in the single-date image analysis, the MLP classifier yielded the highest overall accuracy in the MT classification scenario. Mean overall accuracy (OA) values for all machine learning methods increased from 57% to 77% with speckle filtering. Using MT SAR data, i.e., three and five S1 imagery, an additional increase in the OA of 8.59% and 13.66% occurred, respectively. Additionally, using three and five S1 imagery for classification, the F1 measure for forest and low vegetation land-cover class exceeded 90%.

Among these, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown exceptional efficiency in automated deprivation mapping at the local scale. Yet these networks have never been used to map very small heterogeneous deprivation areas (pockets) at large scale. This study proposes and evaluates a U-Net-Compound model to map deprivation pockets in Bangalore, India. The model only relies on RGB satellite images with a resolution of 2 m as these are more commonly accessible to local urban planning departments. The experiment assumes a practical situation where only limited reference data is available for the model to learn the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets. It tests whether an updated map of deprivation pockets can be obtained with limited information. The model performance to map a large number of deprivation pockets is examined by incrementally changing the model architecture and the amount of training data. Results show that the proposed model is sensitive to the amount of spatial information contained in the training data. Once sufficient spatial information is learnt through a few samples, the city scale mapping accuracy outperforms existing models in mapping small deprivation pockets, achieving a Jaccard Index of 54%. This study demonstrated that a well-designed convolutional neural network can map the existence, extent, as well as distribution patterns of deprivation pockets at the city scale with limited training data, which is essential for upscaling research outputs to provide important information for the formulation of pro-poor policies. \u00a9 2019","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deprivation pockets","training data","city scale","spatial information","convolutional neural","neural networks","satellite images","accuracy outperforms","achieving jaccard","areas pockets","assumes practical","automated deprivation","bangalore india","commonly accessible","commonly referred","data results","deprivation areas","deprivation commonly","deprivation mapping","distribution patterns","evaluates model","exceptional efficiency","existence extent","existing models","experiment assumes","frequently applied","heterogeneous deprivation","important information","incrementally changing","information contained","limited information","limited reference","local scale","local urban","map deprivation","map large","mapping accuracy","mapping small","model architecture","model performance","networks machine","outperforms existing","planning departments","pockets achieving","practical situation","proposed model","provide important","research outputs","rgb satellite","scale mapping","shown exceptional","small deprivation","small heterogeneous","spatial morphology","study demonstrated","sufficient spatial","updated map","upscaling research","urban deprivation","jaccard index","limited training","map urban","reference data","large scale","study proposes","deep convolutional","large number","learning techniques","results show","neural network","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deprivation pockets","training data","city scale","spatial information","convolutional neural","neural networks","satellite images","accuracy outperforms","achieving jaccard","areas pockets","assumes practical","automated deprivation","bangalore india","commonly accessible","commonly referred","data results","deprivation areas","deprivation commonly","deprivation mapping","distribution patterns","evaluates model","exceptional efficiency","existence extent","existing models","experiment assumes","frequently applied","heterogeneous deprivation","important information","incrementally changing","information contained","limited information","limited reference","local scale","local urban","map deprivation","map large","mapping accuracy","mapping small","model architecture","model performance","networks machine","outperforms existing","planning departments","pockets achieving","practical situation","proposed model","provide important","research outputs","rgb satellite","scale mapping","shown exceptional","small deprivation","small heterogeneous","spatial morphology","study demonstrated","sufficient spatial","updated map","upscaling research","urban deprivation","jaccard index","limited training","map urban","reference data","large scale","study proposes","deep convolutional","large number","learning techniques","results show","neural network","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deprivation pockets","convolutional neural","training data","city scale","neural networks","spatial information","satellite images","accuracy outperforms","achieving jaccard","areas pockets","assumes practical","automated deprivation","bangalore india","commonly accessible","commonly referred","data results","deep convolutional","deprivation areas","deprivation commonly","deprivation mapping","distribution patterns","evaluates model","exceptional efficiency","existence extent","existing models","experiment assumes","frequently applied","heterogeneous deprivation","important information","incrementally changing","information contained","jaccard index","large scale","learning techniques","limited information","limited reference","limited training","local scale","local urban","map deprivation","map large","map urban","mapping accuracy","mapping small","model architecture","model performance","networks machine","outperforms existing","planning departments","pockets achieving","practical situation","proposed model","provide important","research outputs","rgb satellite","scale mapping","shown exceptional","small deprivation","small heterogeneous","spatial morphology","study demonstrated","sufficient spatial","updated map","upscaling research","urban deprivation","large number","reference data","study proposes","neural network","results show","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":111,"Year":2018,"Title":"Road centerline extraction from very-high-resolution aerial image and LiDAR data based on road connectivity","Abstract":"The road networks provide key information for a broad range of applications such as urban planning, urban management, and navigation. The fast-developing technology of remote sensing that acquires high-resolution observational data of the land surface offers opportunities for automatic extraction of road networks. However, the road networks extracted from remote sensing images are likely affected by shadows and trees, making the road map irregular and inaccurate. This research aims to improve the extraction of road centerlines using both very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by accounting for road connectivity. The proposed method first applies the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to segment remote sensing images into image objects and then classifies image objects using the machine learning classifier, random forest. A post-processing approach based on the minimum area bounding rectangle (MABR) is proposed and a structure feature index is adopted to obtain the complete road networks. Finally, a multistep approach, that is, morphology thinning, Harris corner detection, and least square fitting (MHL) approach, is designed to accurately extract the road centerlines from the complex road networks. The proposed method is applied to three datasets, including the New York dataset obtained from the object identification dataset, the Vaihingen dataset obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2D semantic labelling benchmark and Guangzhou dataset. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can obtain the highest completeness, correctness, and quality for the three datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is an efficient solution for extracting road centerlines in complex scenes from VHR aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data.

The first mapping results of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) in China for 2018 have been recently released. However, such kind of national maps may not sufficiently meet the growing demand for regional analysis. To address this shortcoming, here we proposed a segmentation-based framework named EULUC-seg to improve the mapping results of EULUC at the city scale. An object-based segmentation approach was first applied to generate the basic mapping units within urban parcels. Multiple features derived from high-resolution remotely sensed and social sensing data were updated and then recalculated within each unit. Random forest was adopted as the machine learning algorithm for classifying urban land use into five Level I classes and twelve Level II classes. Finally, an accuracy assessment was carried out based on a collection of manually interpreted samples. Results showed that our derived map achieved an overall accuracy of 87.58% for Level I, and 73.53% for Level II. The accurate and refined map of EULUC-seg is expected to better support various applications in the future. \u00a9 2020, by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban land","level ii","mapping results","essential urban","use categories","land use","approach understanding","basic mapping","better support","china approach","city scale","classes finally","classifying urban","decision support","derived map","five level","framework named","growing demand","ii classes","interpreted samples","level classes","manually interpreted","map achieved","mapping units","national maps","parcels multiple","planning decision","proposed framework","recently released","refined map","regional analysis","regional mapping","samples results","segmentation approach","sufficiently meet","support various","twelve level","understanding distributions","unit random","urban parcels","categories euluc","features derived","great importance","multiple features","resource allocation","various applications","accuracy assessment","social sensing","learning algorithm","sensing data","remotely sensed","results showed","overall accuracy","random forest","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban land","land use","level ii","mapping results","essential urban","use categories","approach understanding","basic mapping","better support","china approach","city scale","classes finally","classifying urban","decision support","derived map","five level","framework named","great importance","growing demand","ii classes","interpreted samples","learning algorithm","level classes","manually interpreted","map achieved","mapping units","multiple features","national maps","parcels multiple","planning decision","proposed framework","recently released","refined map","regional analysis","regional mapping","resource allocation","results showed","samples results","segmentation approach","sufficiently meet","support various","twelve level","understanding distributions","unit random","urban parcels","various applications","accuracy assessment","categories euluc","features derived","overall accuracy","remotely sensed","social sensing","sensing data","random forest","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban land","land use","level ii","mapping results","essential urban","use categories","approach understanding","basic mapping","better support","china approach","city scale","classes finally","classifying urban","decision support","derived map","five level","framework named","great importance","growing demand","ii classes","interpreted samples","learning algorithm","level classes","manually interpreted","map achieved","mapping units","multiple features","national maps","parcels multiple","planning decision","proposed framework","recently released","refined map","regional analysis","regional mapping","resource allocation","results showed","samples results","segmentation approach","sufficiently meet","support various","twelve level","understanding distributions","unit random","urban parcels","various applications","accuracy assessment","categories euluc","features derived","overall accuracy","remotely sensed","social sensing","sensing data","random forest","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":113,"Year":2019,"Title":"Evaluation and comparison of eight machine learning models in land use\/land cover mapping using Landsat 8 OLI: a case study of the northern region of Iran","Abstract":"Land use land cover change mapping has been used for monitoring environmental changes as an essential factor to study on the earth\u2019s surface land cover in the field of climate change phenomena such as floods and droughts.

However, natural ventilation requirements and guidelines in current building codes and standards are either qualitative or quantitative but subject to an absolute indoor airspeed threshold without considering the outdoor wind environment. To fill this gap, this paper develops an urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and defines a novel ventilation index to assess natural ventilation potential. The index considers wind environments of both indoor and outdoor spaces. First, the coupled CFD model is developed to study wind-driven cross ventilation in high-density cities. A 3D isothermal CFD simulation is solved using the RNG k-\u03b5 turbulent model. The simulation results are compared with wind tunnel experiment data from literature. Second, six key design variables are used to generate 3840 parametric design variations for natural ventilation assessment. Third, a novel integrated index CIOIv (coupled indoor and outdoor interaction) is proposed to evaluate the wind speed ratio between the indoor area and outdoor reference area. For demonstration, CIOIv,F1 is used to represent CIOIv on the ground level. Data-driven CIOIv,F1 models are developed to predict indoor building ventilation potential for quick early design support. Compared with multivariate linear regression model, the Gradient Boosting non-linear model displays much higher prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error = 0.16 with R2 = 0.8). In early design stage, designers and engineers can skip the computational expensive CFD simulations and use this data-drive model to quickly check the building natural ventilation potentials of different design options in an urban environment. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["natural ventilation","ventilation potential","coupled cfd","cfd

studies have been made on street quality, physical activity and public health. However, most studies so far have focused on only few features, such as street greenery or accessibility. These features fail to capture people\u2019s holistic perceptions. The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method. The classification was tested with experts.

Particularly, predicting pedestrian crossings at crosswalks is of considerable importance for avoiding accidents on the one hand and not unnecessarily slowing down traffic on the other hand. Traditional model-based motion tracking and prediction approaches have difficulties in capturing abrupt changes in motions, as humans can perform them. In this paper, an approach for predicting pedestrian motions that combines established motion tracking algorithms with data-driven methods is presented. The approach is built upon a hierarchical structure, where first, the intent of each pedestrian is classified. Then, the approach computes several qualitative metrics, such as time-to-cross, for the pedestrians classified as crossing. The approach is evaluated on a challenging urban data set collected for different types of crosswalks such as roundabouts and straight roads. The evaluation also provides a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed approach. \u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["motion tracking","pedestrian motions","predicting pedestrian","abrupt changes","approach computes","autonomous driving","avoiding accidents","capturing abrupt","challenging problems","challenging urban","combines established","considerable importance","crosswalks robust","data set","driving particularly","established motion","generalization performance","hand traditional","hierarchical structure","inferring pedestrian","particularly predicting","pedestrian behavior","pedestrian crossings","pedestrians classified","prediction approaches","provides thorough","qualitative metrics","robust prediction","set collected","straight roads","thorough analysis","tracking algorithms","traditional motion","unnecessarily slowing","urban crosswalks","different types","proposed approach","urban data"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["motion tracking","pedestrian motions","predicting pedestrian","abrupt changes","approach computes","autonomous driving","avoiding accidents","capturing abrupt","challenging problems","challenging urban","combines established","considerable importance","crosswalks robust","data set","driving particularly","established motion","generalization performance","hand traditional","hierarchical structure","inferring pedestrian","particularly predicting","pedestrian behavior","pedestrian crossings","pedestrians classified","prediction approaches","provides thorough","qualitative metrics","robust prediction","set collected","straight roads","thorough analysis","tracking algorithms","traditional motion","unnecessarily slowing","urban crosswalks","different types","proposed approach","urban data"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["motion tracking","pedestrian motions","predicting pedestrian","abrupt changes","approach computes","autonomous driving","avoiding accidents","capturing abrupt","challenging problems","challenging urban","combines established","considerable importance","crosswalks robust","data set","driving particularly","established motion","generalization performance","hand traditional","hierarchical structure","inferring pedestrian","particularly predicting","pedestrian behavior","pedestrian crossings","pedestrians classified","prediction approaches","provides thorough","qualitative metrics","robust prediction","set collected","straight roads","thorough analysis","tracking algorithms","traditional motion","unnecessarily slowing","urban crosswalks","different types","proposed approach","urban data"]},{"DocId":117,"Year":2017,"Title":"Structure and information in spatial segregation","Abstract":"Ethnoracial residential segregation is a complex, multiscalar phenomenon with immense moral and economic costs. Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons.

Both applications rely on the sensor traces generated by travellers\u2019 smartphones. These traces can be used to interpret travel modes, both for generating automated travel diaries as well as for real-time travel mode detection. Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also, segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the location traces. In order to address all these challenges a novel, state based bottom-up approach is proposed. This approach assumes a fixed atomic segment of a homogeneous state, instead of an event-based segment, and a progressive iteration until a new state is found. The research investigates how an atomic state-based approach can be developed in such a way that can work in real time, near-real time and offline mode and in different environmental conditions with their varying quality of sensor traces. The results show the proposed bottom-up model outperforms the existing event-based segmentation models in terms of adaptivity, flexibility, accuracy and richness in information delivery pertinent to automated travel behavior interpretation. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["automated travel","real time","sensor traces","travel behavior","activity transitions","adaptivity flexibility","applications rely","approach assumes","approaches segment","assumes fixed","atomic approach","atomic segment","based approach","behavior interpretation","certain criteria","challenges novel","criteria drop","delivery pertinent","detection current","different environmental","effective urban","enabling various","environmental conditions","existing approaches","existing segmentation","fixed atomic","flexibility accuracy","frequent gaps","generating automated","homogeneous state","information delivery","interpret travel","interpretation approach","involve significant","location traces","new state","novel state","offline mode","progressive iteration","research investigates","segment trajectory","segmentation approaches","segmentation models","segmentation understanding","service maas","service provisions","significant vagueness","state based","support mobility","time interpretation","time time","traces generated","trajectory segmentation","travel diaries","travel interpretation","travel modes","travellers smartphones","understanding travel","urban travel","various service","varying quality","automated urban","current approaches","model outperforms","mode detection","proposed model","travel mode","results show","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["automated travel","sensor traces","real time","travel behavior","activity transitions","adaptivity flexibility","applications rely","approach assumes","approaches segment","assumes fixed","atomic approach","atomic segment","automated urban","based approach","behavior interpretation","certain criteria","challenges novel","criteria drop","delivery pertinent","detection current","different environmental","enabling various","existing approaches","existing segmentation","fixed atomic","flexibility accuracy","frequent gaps","generating automated","homogeneous state","information delivery","interpret travel","interpretation approach","involve significant","location traces","new state","novel state","offline mode","progressive iteration","research investigates","segment trajectory","segmentation approaches","segmentation models","segmentation understanding","service maas","service provisions","significant vagueness","state based","support mobility","time interpretation","time time","traces generated","trajectory segmentation","travel diaries","travel interpretation","travel modes","travellers smartphones","understanding travel","urban travel","various service","varying quality","current approaches","effective urban","environmental conditions","model outperforms","travel mode","mode detection","proposed model","results show","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["automated travel","sensor traces","travel behavior","real time","activity transitions","adaptivity flexibility","applications rely","approach assumes","approaches segment","assumes fixed","atomic approach","atomic segment","automated urban","based approach","behavior interpretation","certain criteria","challenges novel","criteria drop","delivery pertinent","detection current","different environmental","effective urban","enabling various","environmental conditions","existing segmentation","fixed atomic","flexibility accuracy","frequent gaps","generating automated","homogeneous state","information delivery","interpret travel","interpretation approach","involve significant","location traces","model outperforms","new state","novel state","offline mode","progressive iteration","research investigates","segment trajectory","segmentation approaches","segmentation models","segmentation understanding","service maas","service provisions","significant vagueness","state based","support mobility","time interpretation","time time","traces generated","trajectory segmentation","travel diaries","travel interpretation","travel modes","travellers smartphones","understanding travel","urban travel","various service","varying quality","current approaches","existing approaches","travel mode","mode detection","proposed model","results show","urban planning"]},{"DocId":119,"Year":2020,"Title":"A data-driven approach for multi-scale GIS-based building energy modeling for analysis, planning and support decision making","Abstract":"Urban planners, local authorities, and energy policymakers often develop strategic sustainable energy plans for the urban building stock in order to minimize overall energy consumption and emissions. Planning at such scales could be informed by building stock modeling using existing building data and Geographic Information System-based mapping. However, implementing these processes involves several issues, namely, data availability, data inconsistency, data scalability, data integration, geocoding, and data privacy. This research addresses the aforementioned information challenges by proposing a generalized integrated methodology that implements bottom-up, data-driven, and spatial modeling approaches for multi-scale Geographic Information System mapping of building energy modeling. This study uses the Irish building stock to map building energy performance at multiple scales. The generalized data-driven methodology uses approximately 650,000 Irish Energy Performance Certificates buildings data to predict more than 2 million buildings\u2019 energy performance. In this case, the approach delivers a prediction accuracy of 88% using deep learning algorithms. These prediction results are then used for spatial modeling at multiple scales from the individual building level to a national level. Furthermore, these maps are coupled with available spatial resources (social, economic, or environmental data) for energy planning, analysis, and support decision-making. The modeling results identify clusters of buildings that have a significant potential for energy savings within any specific region. Geographic Information System-based modeling aids stakeholders in identifying priority areas for implementing energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the stakeholders could target local communities for retrofit campaigns, which would enhance the implementation of sustainable energy policy decisions. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier

earth-observation techniques and a machine learning-based approach","Abstract":"Climate change has increased the likelihood of the occurrence of disasters like wildfires, floods, storms, and landslides worldwide in the last years. Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment. \u00a9 2020 by the

response to pluvial flooding-prone demand points using integrated multiple layer perceptron and maximum coverage location problem models","Abstract":"The increases in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events due to global climate change and the development of additional pavement, roads and water storage sites due to population growth have enhanced the probability of pluvial flooding (PF) in urban areas. The estimation of urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However, uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the nearest ERC. \u00a9

Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level.

In this work, we present a workflow that utilizes optical and elevation data to detect vehicles in remotely sensed urban data. This workflow consists of three consecutive stages: candidate identification, classification, and single vehicle extraction. Unlike in most previous approaches, fusion of both data sources is strongly pursued at all stages. While the first stage utilizes the fact that most man-made objects are rectangular in shape, the second and third stages employ machine learning techniques combined with specific features. The stages are designed to handle multiple sensor input, which results in a significant improvement. A detailed evaluation shows the benefits of our workflow, which includes hand-tailored features; even in comparison with classification approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks, which are state of the art in computer vision, we could obtain a comparable or superior performance (F1 score of 0.96\u20130.94). \u00a9 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Increase in Anthropogenic Impervious Surfaces (AIS) for a region is a true representation of urban expansion. Monitoring of AIS in an urban region is helpful for better urban planning and resource management. Cost effective and efficient maps of AIS can be obtained for larger areas using remote sensing techniques. In the present study, extraction of AIS has been carried out using Double window Flexible Pace Search (DFPS) from a new index named as Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (NDAISI). NDAISI is developed by enhancing Biophysical Composition Index (BCI) in two stages using a new Modified Normalized Difference Soil Index (MNDSI). MNDSI has been developed from Band 7 and Band 8 (PAN) of Landsat 8 data. In comparison to existing impervious surface extraction methods, the new NDAISI approach is able to improve Spectral Discrimination Index (SDI) for bare soil and AIS significantly. Overall accuracy of mapping of AIS, using NDAISI approach has been found to be increased by nearly 23% when compared with existing impervious surface extraction methods. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["impervious surface","impervious surfaces","anthropogenic impervious","existing impervious","extraction methods","ndaisi approach","surface extraction","normalized difference","ais significantly","ais using","band pan","base flow","better urban","biophysical composition","climate increase","composition index","cost effective","data impervious","difference impervious","difference soil","discrimination index","double window","efficient maps","enhancing biophysical","expansion monitoring","flexible pace","flow water","groundwater base","improve spectral","index bci","index mndsi","index named","index ndaisi","index sdi","larger areas","management cost","mndsi mndsi","modified normalized","ndaisi ndaisi","new index","new modified","new ndaisi","pace search","runoff groundwater","search dfps","sensing techniques","significant impact","significantly overall","soil index","spectral discrimination","stages using","study extraction","surface index","surfaces ais","true representation","two stages","urban runoff","using double","using ndaisi","window flexible","area using","bare soil","resource management","using new","areas using","landsat data","present study","using remote","water quality","urban region","satellite data","landsat satellite","using landsat","urban expansion","overall accuracy","remote sensing","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["impervious surface","impervious surfaces","anthropogenic impervious","existing impervious","extraction methods","ndaisi approach","normalized difference","surface extraction","ais significantly","ais using","area using","areas using","band pan","bare soil","base flow","better urban","biophysical composition","climate increase","composition index","cost effective","data impervious","difference impervious","difference soil","discrimination index","double window","efficient maps","enhancing biophysical","expansion monitoring","flexible pace","flow water","groundwater base","improve spectral","index bci","index mndsi","index named","index ndaisi","index sdi","landsat data","larger areas","management cost","mndsi mndsi","modified normalized","ndaisi ndaisi","new index","new modified","new ndaisi","overall accuracy","pace search","present study","resource management","runoff groundwater","search dfps","sensing techniques","significant impact","significantly overall","soil index","spectral discrimination","stages using","study extraction","surface index","surfaces ais","true representation","two stages","urban region","urban runoff","using double","using ndaisi","using new","window flexible","satellite data","urban expansion","using remote","water quality","landsat satellite","urban planning","using landsat","remote sensing"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["impervious surface","impervious surfaces","anthropogenic impervious","existing impervious","extraction methods","ndaisi approach","normalized difference","surface extraction","ais significantly","ais using","area using","areas using","band pan","bare soil","base flow","better urban","biophysical composition","climate increase","composition index","cost effective","data impervious","difference impervious","difference soil","discrimination index","double window","efficient maps","enhancing biophysical","expansion monitoring","flexible pace","flow water","groundwater base","improve spectral","index bci","index mndsi","index named","index ndaisi","index sdi","landsat data","larger areas","management cost","mndsi mndsi","modified normalized","ndaisi ndaisi","new index","new modified","new ndaisi","pace search","present study","resource management","runoff groundwater","search dfps","sensing techniques","significant impact","significantly overall","soil index","spectral discrimination","stages using","study extraction","surface index","surfaces ais","true representation","two stages","urban runoff","using double","using ndaisi","using new","window flexible","urban region","water quality","using remote","overall accuracy","satellite data","urban expansion","using landsat","landsat satellite","remote sensing","urban planning"]},{"DocId":127,"Year":2016,"Title":"Using abstractions to solve opportunistic crime security games at scale","Abstract":"In this paper, we aim to deter urban crime by recommending optimal police patrol strategies against opportunistic criminals in large scale urban problems. While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

model (ABM-learning) for urban land use planning: A case study of residential land growth simulation in Shenzhen, China","Abstract":"A forward-looking urban land use plan is crucial to a city's sustainability, which requires a deep understanding of human-environment interactions between different domains, and modelling them soundly. One of the key challenges of modelling these interactions is to understand and model how human individuals make and develop their location decisions by learning that then shape urban land-use patterns. To investigate this issue, we have constructed an extended experience-weighted attraction learning model to represent the human agents\u2019 learning when they make location decisions. Consequently, we propose and have developed an agent-based learning-embedded model (ABM-learning) for residential land growth simulation that incorporates a learning model, a decision-making model, a land use conversion model and the constraint of urban land use master plan. The proposed model was used for a simulation of the residential land growth in Shenzhen city, China. By validating the model against empirical data, the results showed that the site-specific accuracy of the model has been improved when embedding learning model. The analysis on the simulation accuracies has proved the argument that modelling individual-level learning matters in the agent's decision model and the agent-based models. We also applied the model to predict residential land growth in Shenzhen from 2015 to 2035, and the result can be a reference for land-use allocation in detailed planning of Shenzhen.

To date, the unprecedented development of location-based services has generated a large amount of unstructured address data. Traditional address matching methods mainly focus on the literal similarity of address records and are therefore not applicable to the unstructured address data. In this study, we introduce an address matching method based on deep learning to identify the semantic similarity between address records. First, we train the word2vec model to transform the address records into their corresponding vector representations. Next, we apply the enhanced sequential inference model (ESIM), a deep text-matching model, to make local and global inferences to determine if two addresses match. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, we fine-tune the model with real-world address data from the Shenzhen Address Database and compare the outputs with those of several popular address matching methods. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a higher matching accuracy for unstructured address records, with its precision, recall, and F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) reaching 0.97 on the test set. \u00a9 2019, \u00a9 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["address matching","address records","address data","unstructured address","matching methods","proposed method","deep learning","achieves higher","address database","addresses match","corresponding vector","crucial step","data traditional","deep model","enhanced sequential","esim deep","generated large","global inferences","harmonic mean","higher matching","inference model","large amount","learning architecture","literal similarity","mainly focus","make local","matching accuracy","matching address","matching method","method achieves","methods mainly","model esim","popular address","recall reaching","semantic address","semantic similarity","sequential inference","shenzhen address","test set","traditional address","two addresses","unprecedented development","vector representations","method based","precision recall","important role","results indicate","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["address matching","address records","address data","unstructured address","matching methods","proposed method","deep learning","achieves higher","address database","addresses match","corresponding vector","crucial step","data traditional","deep model","enhanced sequential","esim deep","generated large","global inferences","harmonic mean","higher matching","important role","inference model","large amount","learning architecture","literal similarity","mainly focus","make local","matching accuracy","matching address","matching method","method achieves","methods mainly","model esim","popular address","precision recall","recall reaching","semantic address","semantic similarity","sequential inference","shenzhen address","test set","traditional address","two addresses","unprecedented development","vector representations","results indicate","method based","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["address matching","address records","address data","unstructured address","matching methods","deep learning","proposed method","achieves higher","address database","addresses match","corresponding vector","crucial step","data traditional","deep model","enhanced sequential","esim deep","generated large","global inferences","harmonic mean","higher matching","important role","inference model","large amount","learning architecture","literal similarity","mainly focus","make local","matching accuracy","matching address","matching method","method achieves","method based","methods mainly","model esim","popular address","precision recall","recall reaching","semantic address","semantic similarity","sequential inference","shenzhen address","test set","traditional address","two addresses","unprecedented development","vector representations","results indicate","urban planning"]},{"DocId":133,"Year":2020,"Title":"A comparison of machine learning methods for the prediction of traffic speed in Urban places","Abstract":"Rising interest in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems combined with the increased availability of collected data allows the study of different methods for prevention of traffic congestion in cities.

For the above applications, LIDAR data need to be classified into binary classes (i.e., terrain and nonterrain) or multiple classes (e.g., ground, vegetation, and buildings). The proposed framework is designed to enhance the generalization performance of binary classification approach by minimizing type II errors. The authors developed and tested the framework on different LIDAR data sets representing geographic sites in Germany and the United States. The results showed that the proposed ensemble framework performed better compared to the existing methods. In addition, the AdaBoost method outperformed the Bagging method on all the terrain types.

Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal. \u00a9 2020 by the author.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban expansion","historical change","agricultural conversion","agricultural cover","analyze historical","analyzing historical","area experiencing","areas fringing","chain mc","change focusing","change generally","combine analyzing","concerning urban","cover quadrupled","demographic growth","entails negative","environmental sustainability","experiencing change","fertile tarai","forested lands","fringing larger","future urban","generally entails","globally urbanization","high demographic","historical trends","increase linearly","larger cities","like nepal","markov chain","mc spatial","models based","negative implications","nepal fertile","nepal globally","nepal tarai","planning combine","poor planning","populous area","predict urban","prime agricultural","scattered settlements","serious concern","small scattered","south asia","spatial models","sustainability particularly","sustainable outcomes","tarai populous","tarai region","trends concerning","trends urban","unplanned loss","unprecedented rate","urban cover","agricultural lands","change due","countries like","effective planning","future trends","using artificial","artificial neural","network ann","neural network","landsat satellite","satellite imagery"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban expansion","historical change","agricultural conversion","agricultural cover","agricultural lands","analyze historical","analyzing historical","area experiencing","areas fringing","chain mc","change due","change focusing","change generally","combine analyzing","concerning urban","cover quadrupled","demographic growth","effective planning","entails negative","environmental sustainability","experiencing change","fertile tarai","forested lands","fringing larger","future trends","future urban","generally entails","globally urbanization","high demographic","historical trends","increase linearly","landsat satellite","larger cities","like nepal","markov chain","mc spatial","models based","negative implications","nepal fertile","nepal globally","nepal tarai","planning combine","poor planning","populous area","predict urban","prime agricultural","scattered settlements","serious concern","small scattered","south asia","spatial models","sustainability particularly","sustainable outcomes","tarai populous","tarai region","trends concerning","trends urban","unplanned loss","unprecedented rate","urban cover","using artificial","artificial neural","countries like","network ann","neural network","satellite imagery"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban expansion","historical change","agricultural conversion","agricultural cover","analyze historical","analyzing historical","area experiencing","areas fringing","chain mc","change due","change focusing","change generally","combine analyzing","concerning urban","cover quadrupled","demographic growth","effective planning","entails negative","environmental sustainability","experiencing change","fertile tarai","forested lands","fringing larger","future trends","future urban","generally entails","globally urbanization","high demographic","historical trends","increase linearly","larger cities","like nepal","markov chain","mc spatial","models based","negative implications","nepal fertile","nepal globally","nepal tarai","planning combine","poor planning","populous area","predict urban","prime agricultural","scattered settlements","serious concern","small scattered","south asia","spatial models","sustainability particularly","sustainable outcomes","tarai populous","tarai region","trends concerning","trends urban","unplanned loss","unprecedented rate","urban cover","using artificial","agricultural lands","artificial neural","countries like","network ann","neural network","satellite imagery","landsat satellite"]},{"DocId":140,"Year":2017,"Title":"How should urban planners be trained to handle big data?","Abstract":"Historically urban planners have been educated and trained to work in a data poor environment. Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment. For decades they have learned how to use census data, which is comprehensive on several basic variables, but is only conducted once per decade so is almost always out of date. More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009). Planners are still being trained in methods that are suitable for a data poor environment (J Plan Educ Res 6:10\u201321, 1986; Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data: the big data revolution!, 101\u2013104, 2011; J Plan Educ Res 15:17\u201333, 1995). In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape. We will discuss how these methods can be integrated into the planning curriculum as well as planning practice. \u00a9 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data poor","data rich","educ res","greater number","plan educ","poor environment","urban planners","new data","big data","aggregated form","analysis berkeley","appropriate tools","basic variables","berkeley planners","cell phone","census data","data historically","data revolution","detailed individual","detailed population","disaggregated levels","distributed sensors","entered data","environment plan","environment urban","frequent time","geographic areas","handle big","historically urban","including distributed","individual real","infrastructure monitoring","larger geographic","monitoring remote","multidimensional data","new environment","new york","phone tracking","planning curriculum","planning education","planning students","population characteristics","quantitative analysis","remote sensing","res analytics","revolution plan","rich environment","rich landscape","sensing social","sensors infrastructure","simple visualization","simulation data","sources including","statistics survey","students take","survey research","take courses","time data","time increments","tracking records","use census","visualization simulation","visualization techniques","york times","data sources","planning practice","real time","social media","data mining","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["big data","data poor","data rich","educ res","greater number","new data","plan educ","poor environment","urban planners","aggregated form","analysis berkeley","appropriate tools","basic variables","berkeley planners","cell phone","census data","data historically","data revolution","detailed individual","detailed population","disaggregated levels","distributed sensors","entered data","environment plan","environment urban","frequent time","geographic areas","handle big","historically urban","including distributed","individual real","infrastructure monitoring","larger geographic","monitoring remote","multidimensional data","new environment","phone tracking","planning curriculum","planning education","planning practice","planning students","population characteristics","quantitative analysis","res analytics","revolution plan","rich environment","rich landscape","sensing social","sensors infrastructure","simple visualization","simulation data","sources including","statistics survey","students take","survey research","take courses","time data","time increments","tracking records","use census","visualization simulation","visualization techniques","york times","new york","real time","data mining","data sources","social media","remote sensing","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data poor","data rich","educ res","greater number","plan educ","poor environment","urban planners","big data","new data","aggregated form","analysis berkeley","appropriate tools","basic variables","berkeley planners","cell phone","census data","data historically","data revolution","detailed individual","detailed population","disaggregated levels","distributed sensors","entered data","environment plan","environment urban","frequent time","geographic areas","handle big","historically urban","including distributed","individual real","infrastructure monitoring","larger geographic","monitoring remote","multidimensional data","new environment","new york","phone tracking","planning curriculum","planning education","planning practice","planning students","population characteristics","quantitative analysis","real time","remote sensing","res analytics","revolution plan","rich environment","rich landscape","sensing social","sensors infrastructure","simple visualization","simulation data","social media","sources including","statistics survey","students take","survey research","take courses","time data","time increments","tracking records","use census","visualization simulation","visualization techniques","york times","data sources","data mining","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":141,"Year":2016,"Title":"Joint prediction of road-Traffic and parking occupancy over a city with representation learning","Abstract":"As journey planning services begins to include real time traffic forecast features in order to compute more accurate routing along the journey, adaptive traffic control systems can also benefit from this prediction so as to minimize traffic congestion. But these two systems dedicated to end user and road traffic management authorities could also benefits from other information, and particularly from parking availability prediction since cruising for parking spot represents a significant part of urban traffic: When looking for a parking, drivers must guess where to go, and if they are wrong, may face long distances to find the next location, resulting in considerable time loss and a worsening of traffic congestion. We focus on the simultaneous prediction of traffic and parking availability. Our approach relay on machine learning techniques and more precisely on representation learning methods: Each road and car-park is represented by a vector in a common large dimensional space which captures both structural and dynamical information about the observed phenomenon. Such a model is thus able to jointly capture the spatio-Temporal correlations between parking and traffic resulting in a high performance prediction system.

Cellular automata (CA) are extensively employed given their simplicity, flexibility, and intuitiveness when simulating dynamic LUC. Previous research, however, has ignored the spatial heterogeneity among sub-regions, instead applying the same transition rules across entire regions; moreover, most existing methods extract neighborhood effects with only one data time slice, which is inconsistent with the nature of neighborhood interactions as a long-term process exhibiting obvious spatiotemporal dependency. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid cellular automata model coupling area partitioning and spatiotemporal neighborhood features learning, named PST-CA. We use a machine-learning-based partitioning strategy, self-organizing map (SOM), to divide entire regions into several homogeneous sub-regions, and further apply a spatiotemporal three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to extract the spatiotemporal neighborhood features. An artificial neural network (ANN) is then built to create a conversion probability map for each sub-region using both spatiotemporal neighborhood features and factors that drive the LUC. Finally, the dynamic simulation results of entire study area are generated by fusing these probability maps, constraints and stochastic factors. Land use data collected from 2000 to 2015 in Shanghai were selected to verify our proposed method. Four traditional models were implemented for comparison, including logistic regression (LR)-CA, support vector machine (SVM)-CA, random forest (RF)-CA and conventional ANN-CA. Results illustrate that the proposed PST-CA outperformed four traditional models, with overall accuracy increased by 4.66%~6.41%. Moreover, three distinctly different \u201ccoverage rate-growth rate\u201d composite patterns of built-up areas are shown in the SOM partitioning results, which verifies SOM's ability to address spatial heterogeneity; while the optimal time steps in 3D CNN generally maintained a positive correlation with the growth rate of built-up areas, which implies longer temporal dependency should be captured for rapidly developing areas. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["neighborhood features","spatiotemporal neighborhood","area partitioning","entire

recent advances in technology, 3D point clouds are getting more and more frequently requested and used, not only for visualization needs but also e.g. by public administrations for urban planning and management. 3D point clouds are also a very frequent source for generating 3D city models which became recently more available for many applications, such as urban development plans, energy evaluation, navigation, visibility analysis and numerous other GIS studies. While the main data sources remained the same (namely aerial photogrammetry and LiDAR), the way these city models are generated have been evolving towards automation with different approaches. As most of these approaches are based on point clouds with proper semantic classes, our aim is to classify aerial point clouds into meaningful semantic classes, e.g. ground level objects (GLO, including roads and pavements), vegetation, buildings' facades and buildings' roofs. In this study we tested and evaluated various machine learning algorithms for classification, including three deep learning algorithms and one machine learning algorithm.

Thus, it is important to examine park accessibility and how it changes over time in relation to community deprivation so as to provide all residents with equitable services. Using the Gaussian-based 2SFCA (two-step floating catchment area) method, this paper analyzes dynamic park accessibility from 2016 to 2018 for communities within the Hangzhou metropolitan area in China and then quantifies the relative role of local contributors to park accessibility changes (population, park and transport network). A machine learning algorithm, which handles the interdependences of deprivation dimensions, is further employed to determine the relationship between community deprivation and park accessibility changes. Results show that park accessibility continued to grow during the study period, and most communities achieved excellent park accessibility by 2018. Population decreases and park increases contribute positively to improved park accessibility, while transport network changes have had less of an impact. Deprived communities have observed a rising trend of park accessibility, while the elderly concentrated communities are more likely to experience declined park accessibility. Our study provides a new methodological framework, which integrates the geographical accessibility model, economic chain substitution model and machine learning algorithm, for understanding the dynamic park access and associated social inequalities in rapidly urbanizing regions. The lessons learned from this study should be insightful for urban planning. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["park accessibility","community deprivation","accessibility changes","dynamic park","park access","relative role","transport network","learning algorithm","accessibility continued","accessibility model","achieved excellent","analyzes dynamic","area method","associated social","building environmentally","catchment area","chain substitution","changes population","changes results","communities achieved","concentrated communities","contribute positively","declined park","deprivation dimensions","deprived communities","economic chain","elderly concentrated","environmentally sustainable","equitable services","examine park","excellent park","experience declined","floating catchment","geographical accessibility","hangzhou metropolitan","impact deprived","important element","improved park","increases contribute","landscapes park","lessons learned","local contributors","methodological framework","model economic","network changes","network machine","new methodological","observed rising","paper analyzes","park increases","park plays","population decreases","population park","provides new","rapidly urbanizing","rising trend","services using","social inequalities","study period","substitution model","time understanding","urban park","urbanizing regions","urban planning","metropolitan area","study provides","sustainable cities","important role","urban landscapes","results show","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["park accessibility","community deprivation","accessibility changes","dynamic park","park access","relative role","transport network","learning algorithm","urban planning","accessibility continued","accessibility model","achieved excellent","analyzes dynamic","area method","associated social","building environmentally","catchment area","chain substitution","changes population","changes results","communities achieved","concentrated communities","contribute positively","declined park","deprivation dimensions","deprived communities","economic chain","elderly concentrated","environmentally sustainable","equitable services","examine park","excellent park","experience declined","floating catchment","geographical accessibility","hangzhou metropolitan","impact deprived","important element","improved park","increases contribute","landscapes park","lessons learned","local contributors","methodological framework","metropolitan area","model economic","network changes","network machine","new methodological","observed rising","paper analyzes","park increases","park plays","population decreases","population park","provides new","rapidly urbanizing","rising trend","services using","social inequalities","study period","substitution model","sustainable cities","time understanding","urban park","urbanizing regions","important role","study provides","urban landscapes","results show","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["park accessibility","community deprivation","accessibility changes","dynamic park","park access","relative role","transport network","learning algorithm","urban planning","accessibility continued","accessibility model","achieved excellent","analyzes dynamic","area method","associated social","building environmentally","catchment area","chain substitution","changes population","changes results","communities achieved","concentrated communities","contribute positively","declined park","deprivation dimensions","deprived communities","economic chain","elderly concentrated","environmentally sustainable","equitable services","examine park","excellent park","experience declined","floating catchment","geographical accessibility","hangzhou metropolitan","impact deprived","important element","important role","improved park","increases contribute","landscapes park","lessons learned","local contributors","metropolitan area","model economic","network changes","network machine","new methodological","observed rising","paper analyzes","park increases","park plays","population decreases","population park","provides new","rapidly urbanizing","rising trend","services using","social inequalities","study period","substitution model","sustainable cities","time understanding","urban park","urbanizing regions","methodological framework","study provides","urban landscapes","machine learning","results show"]},{"DocId":146,"Year":2019,"Title":"Multivariate relationships between campus design parameters and energy performance using reinforcement learning and parametric modeling","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%.

based image analysis of world view-3 imagery for urban hydrologic modelling at the catchment scale","Abstract":"China's Sponge City initiative will involve widespread installation of new stormwater infrastructure including green roofs, permeable pavements and rain gardens in at least 30 cities. Hydrologic modelling can support the planning of Sponge Cities at the catchment scale, however, highly detailed spatial data for model input can be challenging to compile from the various authorities, or, if available, may not be sufficiently detailed or updated. Remote sensing methods show great promise for mitigating this challenge due to their ability to efficiently classify satellite images into categories relevant to a specific application. In this study Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was applied to WorldView-3 satellite imagery (2017) to create a detailed land cover map of an urban catchment area in Beijing. While land cover classification results based on a Bayesian machine learning classifier alone provided an overall land cover classification accuracy of 63%, the subsequent inclusion of a series of refining rules in combination with supplementary data (including elevation and parcel delineations), yielded the significantly improved overall accuracy of 76%. Results of the land cover classification highlight the limitations of automated classification based on satellite imagery alone and the value of supplementary data and additional rules to refine classification results. Catchment scale hydrologic modelling based on the generated land cover results indicated that 61 to 82% of rainfall volume could be captured for a range of 24 h design storms under varying degrees of

many applications such as urban planning, crop yield forecasting, mapping, and policy making. Semantic segmentation could enable automatic, efficient, and large-scale understanding of overhead imageries for these applications. However, semantic segmentation of overhead imageries is a challenging task, primarily due to the large domain gap from existing research in ground imageries, unavailability of large-scale dataset with pixel-level annotations, and inherent complexity in the task. Readily available vast amount of unlabeled overhead imageries share more common structures and patterns compared to the ground imageries, therefore, its large-scale analysis could benefit from unsupervised feature learning techniques. In this work, we study various self-supervised feature learning techniques for semantic segmentation of overhead imageries. We choose image semantic inpainting as a self-supervised task [36] for our experiments due to its proximity to the semantic segmentation task. We (i) show that existing approaches are inefficient for semantic segmentation, (ii) propose architectural changes towards self-supervised learning for semantic segmentation, (iii) propose an adversarial training scheme for self-supervised learning by increasing the pretext task's difficulty gradually and show that it leads to learning better features, and (iv) propose a unified approach for overhead scene parsing, road network extraction, and land cover estimation. Our approach improves over training from scratch by more than 10% and ImageNet pre-trained network by more than 5% mIOU. \u00a9 2018.

Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

and colour-infrared imaging to identify deciduous tree species in an urban environment","Abstract":"One may consider the application of remote sensing as a trade-off between the imaging platforms, sensors, and data gathering and processing techniques. This study addresses the potential of hyperspectral imaging using ultra-light aircraft for vegetation species mapping in an urban environment, exploring both the engineering and scientific aspects related to imaging platform design and image classification methods. An imaging system based on simultaneous use of Rikola frame format hyperspectral and Nikon D800E adopted colour infrared cameras installed onboard a Bekas X32 manned ultra-light aircraft is introduced. Two test imaging flight missions were conducted in July of 2015 and September of 2016 over a 4000 ha area in Kaunas City, Lithuania. Sixteen and 64 spectral bands in 2015 and 2016, respectively, in a spectral range of 500-900 nm were recorded with colour infrared images. Three research questions were explored assessing the identification of six deciduous tree species: (1) Pre-treatment of spectral features for classification, (2) testing five conventional machine learning classifiers, and (3) fusion of hyperspectral and colour infrared images. Classification performance was assessed by applying leave-one-out cross-validation at the individual crown level and using as a reference at least 100 field inventoried trees for each species. The best-performing classification algorithm-multilayer perceptron, using all spectral properties extracted from the hyperspectral images-resulted in a moderate classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy was 63%, Cohen's Kappa was 0.54, and the species-specific classification accuracies were in the range of 51-72%. Hyperspectral images resulted in significantly better tree species classification ability than the colour infrared images and simultaneous use of spectral properties extracted from hyperspectral and colour infrared images improved slightly the accuracy over the 2015 image. Even though classifications using hyperspectral data cubes of 64 bands resulted in relatively larger accuracies than with 16 bands, classification error matrices were not statistically different. Alternative imaging platforms (like an unmanned aerial vehicle and a Cessna 172 aircraft) and settings of the flights were discussed using simulated imaging projects assuming the same study area and field of application. Ultra-light aircraft-based hyperspectral and colour-infrared imaging was considered to be a technically and economically sound solution for urban green space inventories to facilitate tree mapping, characterization, and monitoring. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["colour infrared","infrared images","tree species","deciduous tree","imaging

to produce better forecasting data. The Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System is a limited-area working model with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km for estimating local-scale weather forecasts on the Korean peninsula. However, in order to numerically predict the detailed temperature characteristics of the urban space, in which surface characteristics change rapidly in a small spatial area, a city temperature prediction model with higher resolution spatial decomposition capabilities is required. As an alternative to this, a building-scale temperature model was developed, and a 25 m air temperature resolution was determined for the Seoul area. The spatial information was processed using statistical methods, such as linear regression models and machine learning. By comparing the accuracy of the estimated air temperatures with observational data during the summer, the machine learning was improved. In addition, horizontal and vertical characteristics of the urban space were better represented, and the air temperature was better resolved spatially. Air temperature information can be used to manage the response to heat-waves and tropical nights in administrative districts of urban areas. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air temperature","korean peninsula","urban space","addition horizontal","administrative districts","area city","better forecasting","better represented","better resolved","change rapidly","characteristics change","city temperature","data assimilation","decomposition capabilities","detailed temperature","diverse weather","estimating weather","forecast system","forecasting data","higher resolution","horizontal resolution","information services","korea meteorological","localweather information","meteorological administration","model local","numerical models","numerically predict","observational data","prediction system","processed using","produce better","resolution spatial","resolved spatially","seoul area","services based","small spatial","spatial area","spatial decomposition","spatial information","spatially air","statistical downscaling","surface characteristics","temperature characteristics","temperature forecast","temperature information","temperature model","temperature prediction","temperature resolution","tropical nights","unified model","using statistical","various numerical","vertical characteristics","weather forecasts","weather phenomena","working model","air temperatures","estimated air","local data","statistical methods","urban air","prediction model","regression models","linear regression","machine learning","urban areas"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air temperature","korean peninsula","urban space","addition horizontal","administrative districts","area city","better forecasting","better represented","better resolved","change rapidly","characteristics change","city temperature","data assimilation","decomposition capabilities","detailed temperature","diverse weather","estimating weather","forecast system","forecasting data","higher resolution","horizontal resolution","information services","korea meteorological","linear regression","local data","localweather information","meteorological administration","model local","numerical models","numerically predict","observational data","prediction system","processed using","produce better","resolution spatial","resolved spatially","seoul area","services based","small spatial","spatial area","spatial decomposition","spatial information","spatially air","statistical downscaling","surface characteristics","temperature characteristics","temperature forecast","temperature information","temperature model","temperature prediction","temperature resolution","tropical nights","unified model","using statistical","various numerical","vertical characteristics","weather forecasts","weather phenomena","working model","air temperatures","estimated air","prediction model","regression models","statistical methods","urban air","machine learning","urban areas"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air temperature","korean peninsula","urban space","addition horizontal","administrative districts","area city","better forecasting","better represented","better resolved","change rapidly","characteristics change","city temperature","data assimilation","decomposition capabilities","detailed temperature","diverse weather","estimating weather","forecast system","forecasting data","higher resolution","horizontal resolution","information services","korea meteorological","linear regression","local data","localweather information","meteorological administration","model local","numerical models","numerically predict","observational data","prediction system","processed using","produce better","resolution spatial","resolved spatially","seoul area","services based","small spatial","spatial area","spatial decomposition","spatial information","spatially air","statistical downscaling","surface characteristics","temperature characteristics","temperature forecast","temperature information","temperature model","temperature prediction","temperature resolution","tropical nights","unified model","using statistical","various numerical","vertical characteristics","weather forecasts","weather phenomena","working model","air temperatures","estimated air","prediction model","regression models","statistical methods","urban air","machine learning","urban areas"]},{"DocId":152,"Year":2017,"Title":"NLOS multipath detection by using machine learning in urban environments","Abstract":"In global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning, GNSS satellites are often obstructed by buildings, leading to reflected and diffracted signals, which are known as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. These cause major positioning (also known as \"NLOS multipath\") errors in GNSS positioning. This paper proposes a novel NLOS multipath detection technique that uses a machine-learning technique to improve positioning accuracy in urban environments. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the code-tracking process within GNSS receivers, the code correlation peak is determined and tracked using the outputs of the signal correlators. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to the direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. For realizing machine learning, we extract the features of the NLOS signal from the shape of the NLOS correlation function, using an actual dataset, to construct an NLOS classifier. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conduct NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We propose to construct an NLOS classifier based on a support vector machine. From the experiments, 87% of the LOS signals and 99% of the NLOS signals are correctly discriminated.

In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events \u2013 especially in the future climate \u2013 this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning. \u00a9 2020 The

model","Abstract":"Urban growth and land-use change are a few of many puzzling factors affecting our future cities. Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions. This will play a vital role in sustaining Jordan's food security. \u00a9 2020Environmental science, Computer science, Geography, Land use planning, Land use change, Urban growth, Machine learning,

densely-distributed building footprints","Abstract":"Building footprints are among the most predominant features in urban areas, and provide valuable information for urban planning, solar energy suitability analysis, etc. We aim to automatically and rapidly identify building footprints by leveraging deep learning techniques and the increased availability of remote sensing datasets at high spatial resolution. The task is computationally challenging due to the use of large training datasets and large number of parameters. In related work, You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for object detection. However, YOLO is limited in its capacity to identify small objects that appear in groups, which is the case for building footprints. We propose a LOcally-COnstrained (LOCO) You-Only-Look-Once framework to detect small and densely-distributed building footprints. LOCO is a variant of YOLO. Its layer architecture is determined by the spatial characteristics of building footprints and it uses a constrained regression modeling to improve the robustness of building size predictions. We also present an invariant augmentation based voting scheme to further improve the precision in the prediction phase. Experiments show that LOCO can greatly improve the solution quality of building detection compared to related work. \u00a9 2019, \u00a9 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building footprints","related work","augmentation based","based voting","building size","computationally challenging","constrained regression","detect small","detecting small","detection compared","energy suitability","footprints building","footprints loco","greatly improve","identify building","invariant augmentation","layer architecture","leveraging deep","loco framework","phase experiments","planning solar","prediction phase","predominant features","propose loco","provide valuable","rapidly identify","regression modeling","sensing datasets","size predictions","small objects","solar energy","solution quality","spatial characteristics","suitability analysis","uses constrained","valuable information","voting scheme","work yolo","yolo framework","challenging due","high spatial","identify small","increased availability","large training","training datasets","deep learning","spatial resolution","experiments show","learning framework","large number","object detection","building detection","learning techniques","urban areas","remote sensing","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building footprints","related work","augmentation based","based voting","building size","computationally challenging","constrained regression","detect small","detecting small","detection compared","energy suitability","footprints building","footprints loco","greatly improve","identify building","invariant augmentation","layer architecture","leveraging deep","loco framework","phase experiments","planning solar","prediction phase","predominant features","propose loco","provide valuable","rapidly identify","regression modeling","sensing datasets","size predictions","small objects","solar energy","solution quality","spatial characteristics","suitability analysis","uses constrained","valuable information","voting scheme","work yolo","yolo framework","challenging due","high spatial","identify small","increased availability","large training","training datasets","deep learning","spatial resolution","experiments show","learning framework","large number","object detection","building detection","learning techniques","urban areas","remote sensing","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building footprints","related work","deep learning","augmentation based","based voting","building size","computationally challenging","constrained regression","detect small","detecting small","detection compared","energy suitability","footprints building","footprints loco","greatly improve","high spatial","identify building","increased availability","invariant augmentation","layer architecture","learning framework","leveraging deep","loco framework","phase experiments","planning solar","prediction phase","predominant features","propose loco","provide valuable","rapidly identify","regression modeling","sensing datasets","size predictions","small objects","solar energy","solution quality","spatial characteristics","spatial resolution","suitability analysis","training datasets","uses constrained","valuable information","voting scheme","work yolo","yolo framework","challenging due","identify small","large training","experiments show","large number","object detection","urban areas","learning techniques","building detection","remote sensing","urban planning"]},{"DocId":157,"Year":2019,"Title":"How does the urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationship change seasonally in Chinese cities? A comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration scales","Abstract":"Understanding how urban forms affect fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations within different seasons is important for sustainable urban development. Thus, the purpose of this study was to quantify the relationships between urban forms and PM2.5 concentration change seasonally in 279 Chinese cities, with the explicit consideration of a comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration scales. A comprehensive evaluation index system of urban forms was calculated based on six urban form metrics (total urban area (CA), number of patches (NP), landscape shape index (LSI), percentage of like adjacencies (PLADJ), patch cohesion index (COHESION), and aggregation index (AI)) by integrating three control variables (temperature, NDVI, and nighttime light). The spatial regression model was subsequently adopted to quantify the effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations. The results revealed that, during the summer and autumn, only urban form compactness was significantly correlated with the PM2.5 concentrations, but more urban form metrics were significantly associated with the PM2.5 concentrations during the spring and winter in Chinese cities. The scattered urban form could effectively reduce the PM2.5 concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Chengdu-Chongqing but not in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei during the winter. The effects of urban forms on PM2.5 concentrations become increasingly noticeable from the national scale to the urban agglomeration scale with seasonal change. This study suggests that the urban form-PM2.5 concentration relationships are sensitive to seasonal variations across different regions. Thus, it is an important approach to solve PM2.5 pollution problem to construct an ideal urban form through flexible urban planning strategies. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier

computing","Abstract":"Road traffic congestion in urban environments poses an increasingly complex challenge of detection, profiling and prediction. Although public policy promotes transport alternatives and new infrastructure, traffic congestion is highly prevalent and continues to be the lead cause for numerous social, economic and environmental issues. Although a significant volume of research has been reported on road traffic prediction, profiling of traffic has received much less attention. In this paper we address two key problems in traffic profiling by proposing a novel unsupervised incremental learning approach for road traffic congestion detection and profiling, dynamically over time. This approach uses (a) hyperdimensional computing to enable capture variable-length trajectories of commuter trips represented as vehicular movement across intersections, and (b) transforms these into feature vectors that can be incrementally learned over time by the Incremental Knowledge Acquiring Self-Learning (IKASL) algorithm. The proposed approach was tested and evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 190 million vehicular movement records obtained from 1,400 Bluetooth identifiers placed at the intersections of the arterial road network in the State of Victoria, Australia. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["road traffic","hyperdimensional computing","vehicular movement","traffic congestion","urban environments","acquiring ikasl","address two","approximately million","bluetooth identifiers","capture trajectories","commuter trips","complex challenge","computing road","congestion detection","dataset consisting","detection profiling","enable capture","environments poses","feature vectors","highly prevalent","identifiers placed","ikasl algorithm","increasingly complex","incremental knowledge","incremental learning","incremental machine","incrementally learned","infrastructure traffic","knowledge acquiring","lead cause","learning approach","million vehicular","movement records","new infrastructure","novel unsupervised","numerous social","policy promotes","prediction profiling","profiling dynamically","promotes transport","proposing novel","records obtained","significant volume","social economic","traffic prediction","traffic profiling","trajectory clustering","transport alternatives","trips represented","two key","unsupervised incremental","uses hyperdimensional","using incremental","victoria australia","approach uses","arterial road","environmental issues","environments using","key problems","public policy","proposed approach","road network","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["road traffic","traffic congestion","hyperdimensional computing","vehicular movement","urban environments","acquiring ikasl","address two","approach uses","approximately million","arterial road","bluetooth identifiers","capture trajectories","commuter trips","complex challenge","computing road","congestion detection","dataset consisting","detection profiling","enable capture","environmental issues","environments poses","environments using","feature vectors","highly prevalent","identifiers placed","ikasl algorithm","increasingly complex","incremental knowledge","incremental learning","incremental machine","incrementally learned","infrastructure traffic","key problems","knowledge acquiring","lead cause","million vehicular","movement records","new infrastructure","novel unsupervised","numerous social","policy promotes","prediction profiling","profiling dynamically","promotes transport","proposing novel","records obtained","significant volume","social economic","traffic prediction","traffic profiling","trajectory clustering","transport alternatives","trips represented","two key","unsupervised incremental","uses hyperdimensional","using incremental","victoria australia","learning approach","public policy","proposed approach","road network","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["road traffic","traffic congestion","hyperdimensional computing","vehicular movement","urban environments","acquiring ikasl","address two","approach uses","approximately million","arterial road","bluetooth identifiers","capture trajectories","commuter trips","complex challenge","computing road","congestion detection","dataset consisting","detection profiling","enable capture","environmental issues","environments poses","environments using","highly prevalent","identifiers placed","ikasl algorithm","increasingly complex","incremental knowledge","incremental learning","incremental machine","incrementally learned","infrastructure traffic","key problems","knowledge acquiring","lead cause","million vehicular","movement records","new infrastructure","novel unsupervised","numerous social","policy promotes","prediction profiling","profiling dynamically","promotes transport","proposed approach","proposing novel","public policy","records obtained","significant volume","social economic","traffic prediction","traffic profiling","trajectory clustering","transport alternatives","trips represented","two key","unsupervised incremental","uses hyperdimensional","using incremental","victoria australia","feature vectors","learning approach","road network","machine learning"]},{"DocId":159,"Year":2019,"Title":"Reversed urbanism: Inferring urban performance through behavioral patterns in temporal telecom data","Abstract":"A fundamental aspect of well performing cities is successful public spaces. For centuries, understanding these places has been limited to sporadic observations and laborious data collection. This study proposes a novel methodology to analyze citywide, discrete urban spaces using highly accurate anonymized telecom data and machine learning algorithms. Through superposition of human dynamics and urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users. Geolocated telecom data, obtained for the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify \u201cstay-points\u201d\u2014events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence, and diversity. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify associations between the formation of these clusters and various urban features such as urban morphology or land-use within a 25\u201350 meters resolution. Some of the urban features that were found to be highly related to the creation of large, diverse and long-lasting clusters were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features, and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have a negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a \u201creversed urbanism\u201d methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning, and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled

plans in a rapidly urbanizing district in Chongqing, China","Abstract":"Analysis of annual land use change is crucial to timely assessment of the impacts of land use policies, especially in rapidly urbanizing areas such as the Liangjiang New District of Chongqing, China. This research aims to assess the impacts of multi-level land use policies and plans and their effectiveness in protecting farmland, and to recommend policies to remedy defective ones. Markov Chain\u2013Cellular Automata modelling was integrated with machine learning to predict future urbanization. The results show that prior to the establishment of the District in late 2010, the urban area grew at 13% annually because local policies promoted profit-motivated development. This rate declined drastically to 4% during 2011\u20132012 in direct response to the changed local land use policies and strict enforcement of national policies. These policies stabilized the urbanization rate at 7% over the subsequent years. The safeguard of previous farmland was possible only when the national policies were aligned closely with the local policies in their aim, provided both were rigorously enforced through a land management agency. Urban land in 2020 is predicted to growth by at least 464 km2 with some differences between two scenarios. In the baseline scenario (no change in policies), almost 70% of new growth will take place inside three industry zones and the duty-free ports. However, in the national overall plan scenario, a significant amount of marginal farmland will be changed into greenfields within the planned urban zones. It is recommended that a hierarchical farmland protection policy be implemented. It should incorporate the national policies that must be adapted to the local settings to achieve sustainable urbanization and to minimize farmland loss. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["use policies","national policies","land use","chongqing china","local policies","rapidly urbanizing","achieve sustainable","agency urban","aim provided","aligned closely","annual land","area grew","automata modelling","baseline scenario","changed local","china analysis","declined drastically","defective ones","direct response","farmland loss","farmland protection","future urbanization","hierarchical farmland","industry zones","liangjiang new","local settings","machine evaluation","management agency","marginal farmland","minimize farmland","national overall","new district","new growth","ones markov","overall plan","plan scenario","planned urban","policies especially","policies promoted","policies stabilized","predict future","previous farmland","promoted development","protecting farmland","protection policy","rate declined","recommend policies","remedy defective","research aims","rigorously enforced","scenario significant","significant amount","strict enforcement","subsequent years","sustainable urbanization","three industry","timely assessment","two scenarios","urban zones","urbanization rate","urbanizing areas","urbanizing district","local land","markov automata","take place","urban area","land management","results show","use change","urban land","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["use policies","national policies","land use","chongqing china","local policies","rapidly urbanizing","achieve sustainable","agency urban","aim provided","aligned closely","annual land","area grew","automata modelling","baseline scenario","changed local","china analysis","declined drastically","defective ones","direct response","farmland loss","farmland protection","future urbanization","hierarchical farmland","industry zones","liangjiang new","local settings","machine evaluation","management agency","marginal farmland","minimize farmland","national overall","new district","new growth","ones markov","overall plan","plan scenario","planned urban","policies especially","policies promoted","policies stabilized","predict future","previous farmland","promoted development","protecting farmland","protection policy","rate declined","recommend policies","remedy defective","research aims","rigorously enforced","scenario significant","significant amount","strict enforcement","subsequent years","sustainable urbanization","three industry","timely assessment","two scenarios","urban zones","urbanization rate","urbanizing areas","urbanizing district","local land","markov automata","take place","land management","results show","urban area","use change","urban land","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["use policies","national policies","land use","chongqing china","local policies","rapidly urbanizing","achieve sustainable","agency urban","aim provided","aligned closely","annual land","area grew","automata modelling","baseline scenario","changed local","china analysis","declined drastically","defective ones","direct response","farmland loss","farmland protection","future urbanization","hierarchical farmland","industry zones","liangjiang new","local settings","machine evaluation","management agency","marginal farmland","minimize farmland","national overall","new district","new growth","ones markov","overall plan","plan scenario","planned urban","policies especially","policies promoted","policies stabilized","predict future","previous farmland","promoted development","protecting farmland","protection policy","rate declined","recommend policies","remedy defective","research aims","rigorously enforced","scenario significant","significant amount","strict enforcement","subsequent years","sustainable urbanization","three industry","timely assessment","two scenarios","urban zones","urbanization rate","urbanizing areas","urbanizing district","local land","markov automata","take place","urban area","land management","results show","use change","urban land","machine learning"]},{"DocId":161,"Year":2019,"Title":"Toward Transportation Mode Recognition Using Deep Convolutional and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks","Abstract":"With the rapid development of mobile Internet techniques, using the sensor-rich smartphones to sense various contexts attracts much attention, such as transportation mode recognition. The transportation mode information can help to improve urban planning, traffic management and journey planning. Though much work has been done on the transportation mode recognition using classic machine learning algorithms, the performance of these methods is not reasonable and heavily relies on the effectiveness of handcrafted features. In this paper, we leverage the strong representation ability of deep learning method and present a deep-learning-based algorithm for transportation mode recognition, namely CL-TRANSMODE, which is capable of accurately detecting multiple transportation modes. The algorithm first uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn appropriate and robust feature representations for transportation modes recognition. Then, an LSTM network performs a further learning of the temporal dependencies characteristics on the feature vectors of CNN output. To further enhance the accuracy of transportation mode recognition, several artificial segments and peak features are extracted from the raw sensor measurements. These features characterize the transportation modes over a much long period of time (minutes or hours). By combining the CNN-extracted features and handcrafted features, our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm can accurately differentiate eight transportation modes, i.e., walking, running, bicycling, driving a car, riding a bus, taking a metro, taking a train, or being stationary. Extensive experiments on both the SHL and HTC datasets demonstrate that use our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative algorithms. On the SHL dataset, which contain barometric data, the accuracy using the CL-TRANSMODE algorithm can reaches 98.1%. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mode

This enables us to maximize the insight gained from this type of studies by fusing both objective (sensor information) and subjective data (direct input from the users). The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas.

Since studying aridity and its trend of changes has a significant role in water resources management and urban planning, this research has investigated spatial and temporal changes and trend of aridity changes in Iran as an arid country. To study the issue, 51 weather stations of Iran which covered a 30-year statistical period (1981\u20132010) were selected. Climatic variables, namely precipitation, vapor pressure, local pressure, temperature, maximum temperature, and relative humidity and required data to calculate the potential evapotranspiration were extracted from Iran meteorology organization data. In next step by applying Ai, Im, and Iq aridity indices, zoning of the aridity was done after studying the aridity traits and its change. Then the most compatible aridity index was introduced according to the values of correlation between climatic factors of aridity indices and the magnitude of each main climatic area of Iran. Furthermore, in order to recognize aridity changes in Iran during the selected 30-year period, Mann-Kendal nonparametric test was used. Correlation analysis results showed that 35.4 and 64.6\u00a0% of Iran arid areas show more compatibility with Im and Ai, respectively, which means that these indices are more appropriate to study aridity in arid regions of Iran. Also, it was revealed that 5.6 and 94.3\u00a0% of Caspian south plain region has more compatibility with Ai and Iq indices, respectively. As a matter of fact, 77.8, 0.75, and 21.4\u00a0% of the country area can be studied better by Ai, Iq, and Im, respectively. Also, the results of Mann-Kendal nonparametric test confirmed that aridity is developing in Iran. In other words, 80.4\u00a0% of Iran area had increasing trend of aridity during the selected period and in just 19.6\u00a0% of the area, aridity trend was not significant or decreasing. \u00a9 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["aridity changes","aridity indices","nonparametric test","selected period","temporal changes","agriculture drinking","ai im","ai iq","ai respectively","applying ai","area aridity","areas show","arid areas","arid country","arid regions","aridity index","aridity traits","aridity trend","caspian south","climatic area","climatic factors","climatic variables","compatible aridity","country area","covered statistical","face serious","im respectively","increasing trend","indices respectively","indices zoning","introduced according","investigated spatial","iq aridity","iq indices","iran area","iran arid","iran meteorology","iran optimum","issue weather","local pressure","main climatic","maximum temperature","meteorology organization","optimum use","organization data","period nonparametric","plain region","potential evapotranspiration","precipitation vapor","pressure local","pressure temperature","recognize aridity","regions like","relative humidity","required data","resources management","selected climatic","serious water","significant role","south plain","statistical period","studied better","study aridity","studying aridity","studying spatial","temperature maximum","test confirmed","vapor pressure","water resources","water tensions","weather stations","analysis results","correlation analysis","like iran","results showed","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["aridity changes","aridity indices","nonparametric test","selected period","temporal changes","agriculture drinking","ai im","ai iq","ai respectively","analysis results","applying ai","area aridity","areas show","arid areas","arid country","arid regions","aridity index","aridity traits","aridity trend","caspian south","climatic area","climatic factors","climatic variables","compatible aridity","correlation analysis","country area","covered statistical","face serious","im respectively","increasing trend","indices respectively","indices zoning","introduced according","investigated spatial","iq aridity","iq indices","iran area","iran arid","iran meteorology","iran optimum","issue weather","like iran","local pressure","main climatic","maximum temperature","meteorology organization","optimum use","organization data","period nonparametric","plain region","potential evapotranspiration","precipitation vapor","pressure local","pressure temperature","recognize aridity","regions like","relative humidity","required data","resources management","selected climatic","serious water","significant role","south plain","statistical period","studied better","study aridity","studying aridity","studying spatial","temperature maximum","test confirmed","vapor pressure","water resources","water tensions","weather stations","results showed","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["aridity changes","aridity indices","nonparametric test","selected period","temporal changes","agriculture drinking","ai im","ai iq","ai respectively","analysis results","applying ai","area aridity","areas show","arid areas","arid country","arid regions","aridity index","aridity traits","aridity trend","caspian south","climatic area","climatic factors","climatic variables","compatible aridity","correlation analysis","country area","covered statistical","face serious","im respectively","increasing trend","indices respectively","indices zoning","introduced according","investigated spatial","iq aridity","iq indices","iran area","iran arid","iran meteorology","iran optimum","issue weather","like iran","local pressure","main climatic","maximum temperature","meteorology organization","optimum use","organization data","period nonparametric","plain region","potential evapotranspiration","precipitation vapor","pressure local","pressure temperature","recognize aridity","regions like","relative humidity","required data","resources management","results showed","selected climatic","serious water","significant role","south plain","statistical period","studied better","study aridity","studying aridity","studying spatial","temperature maximum","test confirmed","vapor pressure","water resources","water tensions","weather stations","urban planning"]},{"DocId":166,"Year":2014,"Title":"Analysis of land use and land cover change in a coastal area of Rio de Janeiro using high-resolution remotely sensed data","Abstract":"Coastal areas offer great recreational and economic opportunities, but require intensive resource management and environmental protection.

The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the \u201creach angle\u201d method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

occupant behaviour, mobility, and energy in buildings: A survey","Abstract":"The proliferation of urban sensing, IoT, and big data in cities provides unprecedented opportunities for a deeper understanding of occupant behaviour and energy usage patterns at the urban scale. This enables data-driven building and energy models to capture the urban dynamics, specifically the intrinsic occupant and energy use behavioural profiles that are not usually considered in traditional models. Although there are related reviews, none investigated urban data for use in modelling occupant behaviour and energy use at multiple scales, from buildings to neighbourhood to city. This survey paper aims to fill this gap by providing a critical summary and analysis of the works reported in the literature. We present the different sources of occupant-centric urban data that are useful for data-driven modelling and categorise the range of applications and recent data-driven modelling techniques for urban behaviour and energy modelling, along with the traditional stochastic and simulation-based approaches. Finally, we present a set of recommendations for future directions in data-driven modelling of occupant behaviour and energy in buildings at the urban scale. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["occupant behaviour","modelling occupant","urban data","energy use","urban scale","approaches finally","behaviour mobility","behavioural profiles","buildings survey","cities provides","critical summary","different sources","dynamics specifically","enables building","energy modelling","energy usage","future directions","intrinsic occupant","investigated urban","modelling techniques","present set","provides unprecedented","providing critical","recent modelling","related reviews","sensing iot","survey paper","traditional models","traditional stochastic","unprecedented opportunities","urban behaviour","urban dynamics","urban sensing","usage patterns","use behavioural","usually considered","works reported","deeper understanding","energy models","multiple scales","paper aims","big data"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["occupant behaviour","modelling occupant","urban data","urban scale","energy use","approaches finally","behaviour mobility","behavioural profiles","buildings survey","cities provides","critical summary","deeper understanding","different sources","dynamics specifically","enables building","energy modelling","energy usage","future directions","intrinsic occupant","investigated urban","modelling techniques","present set","provides unprecedented","providing critical","recent modelling","related reviews","sensing iot","survey paper","traditional models","traditional stochastic","unprecedented opportunities","urban behaviour","urban dynamics","urban sensing","usage patterns","use behavioural","usually considered","works reported","big data","energy models","multiple scales","paper aims"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["occupant behaviour","modelling occupant","urban data","energy use","urban scale","approaches finally","behaviour mobility","behavioural profiles","buildings survey","cities provides","critical summary","deeper understanding","different sources","dynamics specifically","enables building","energy modelling","energy usage","future directions","intrinsic occupant","investigated urban","modelling techniques","present set","provides unprecedented","providing critical","recent modelling","related reviews","sensing iot","survey paper","traditional models","traditional stochastic","unprecedented opportunities","urban behaviour","urban dynamics","urban sensing","usage patterns","use behavioural","usually considered","works reported","big data","energy models","multiple scales","paper aims"]},{"DocId":170,"Year":2020,"Title":"Automated classification of social network messages into Smart Cities dimensions","Abstract":"A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities\u2019 evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation's companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers\u2019 companies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier

buildings from airborne LiDAR point clouds","Abstract":"Urban villages (UVs) are commonly found in many Asian cities. These villages contain many closely packed buildings constructed decades ago without proper urban planning. There is a need for those buildings to be identified and put into statistics. In this paper, we present a segmentation framework that invokes multiple machine learning techniques and point cloud\/image processing algorithms to segment individual closely packed buildings from large urban scenes. The presented framework consists of two major segmentation processes. The framework first filters out the non-ground objects from the point cloud, then it classified them by using the Random Forest classifier to isolate buildings from the entire scene. After that, the building point clouds will be segmented based on several building attribute analysis methods. This is followed by using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) plane filtering method to expand the space between two closely packed buildings, so that the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering technique can be used to more accurately segment each individual building from the closely packed building areas. Two airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets collected in two different cities with some typical closely packed buildings were used to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can effectively identify the closely packed buildings with unified structures from large airborne LiDAR datasets. The overall segmentation accuracy reaches 84% for the two datasets. The proposed framework can serve as a basis for analysis and segmentation of closely packed buildings with a more complicated structure. \u00a9 2020, \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["closely packed","packed buildings","lidar datasets","segmentation framework","point clouds","proposed framework","airborne lidar","accuracy reaches","accurately segment","analysis methods","areas two","asian cities","attribute analysis","building attribute","building point","buildings constructed","clouds urban","clustering technique","commonly found","complicated structure","consensus ransac","constructed decades","datasets collected","dbscan clustering","decades ago","different cities","effectively identify","entire scene","filtering method","individual building","individual closely","invokes multiple","isolate buildings","large airborne","large urban","major segmentation","multiple machine","noise dbscan","overall segmentation","packed building","plane filtering","point processing","present segmentation","presented framework","processing algorithms","proper urban","random sample","ransac plane","robust segmentation","sample consensus","segment individual","segmentation accuracy","segmentation processes","segmented based","spatial clustering","two airborne","two closely","typical closely","unified structures","urban villages","villages contain","villages uvs","airborne light","building areas","forest classifier","framework consists","two datasets","two different","two major","urban scenes","lidar point","point cloud","ranging lidar","learning techniques","light detection","random forest","results show","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["closely packed","packed buildings","lidar datasets","segmentation framework","point clouds","proposed framework","airborne lidar","accuracy reaches","accurately segment","analysis methods","areas two","asian cities","attribute analysis","building attribute","building point","buildings constructed","clouds urban","clustering technique","commonly found","complicated structure","consensus ransac","constructed decades","datasets collected","dbscan clustering","decades ago","different cities","effectively identify","entire scene","filtering method","individual building","individual closely","invokes multiple","isolate buildings","large airborne","large urban","major segmentation","multiple machine","noise dbscan","overall segmentation","packed building","plane filtering","point processing","present segmentation","presented framework","processing algorithms","proper urban","random sample","ransac plane","robust segmentation","sample consensus","segment individual","segmentation accuracy","segmentation processes","segmented based","spatial clustering","two airborne","two closely","typical closely","unified structures","urban villages","villages contain","villages uvs","airborne light","building areas","forest classifier","framework consists","two datasets","two different","two major","urban scenes","lidar point","point cloud","ranging lidar","random forest","learning techniques","light detection","results show","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["closely packed","packed buildings","lidar datasets","proposed framework","segmentation framework","airborne lidar","point clouds","accuracy reaches","accurately segment","airborne light","analysis methods","areas two","asian cities","attribute analysis","building areas","building attribute","building point","buildings constructed","clouds urban","clustering technique","commonly found","complicated structure","consensus ransac","constructed decades","datasets collected","dbscan clustering","decades ago","different cities","effectively identify","entire scene","filtering method","forest classifier","framework consists","individual building","individual closely","invokes multiple","isolate buildings","large airborne","large urban","major segmentation","multiple machine","noise dbscan","overall segmentation","packed building","plane filtering","point processing","present segmentation","presented framework","processing algorithms","proper urban","random forest","random sample","ransac plane","robust segmentation","sample consensus","segment individual","segmentation accuracy","segmentation processes","segmented based","spatial clustering","two airborne","two closely","two datasets","two different","typical closely","unified structures","urban scenes","urban villages","villages contain","villages uvs","ranging lidar","two major","lidar point","results show","light detection","point cloud","learning techniques","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":172,"Year":2020,"Title":"Analyzing the spatial factors related to the distributions of building heights in urban areas: A comparative case study in Guangzhou and Shenzhen","Abstract":"Rapid urbanization has become an increasingly serious issue worldwide. While most previous studies focused on two-dimensional urban development, the spatial characteristics of building heights are rarely explored. Such information could provide valuable implications for smart urban planning and management. However, previous attempts did not systematically investigate the spatial factors that influence building heights and their associations with urban development. Therefore, this study developed a machine learning-based method to compare the distributions of building heights in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two cities with different development patterns. First, we collected detailed information on the buildings, such as the location and land values. Second, the height of each building was simulated based on the above information using the well-known random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and artificial neural network. The random forests algorithm outperformed the other two in both cities. We also found that the commercial land value is the most important factor associated with building heights. Moreover, the building heights in Guangzhou are more sensitive to the distances to administrative centers, while the distances to transportation networks exert stronger influences on the building heights in Shenzhen. Overall, these findings could support urban planning and management. More importantly, the proposed method can be used to predict the heights of new buildings and investigate the distributions of building heights in other regions. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building heights","random forests","spatial factors","urban development","administrative centers","algorithm outperformed","areas comparative","collected detailed","comparative case","detailed information","different development","exert stronger","factor associated","forests algorithm","forests neighbor","important factor","increasingly serious","influence building","information using","issue worldwide","land value","land values","neighbor algorithm","networks exert","new buildings","previous attempts","provide valuable","rarely explored","serious issue","shenzhen overall","shenzhen rapid","shenzhen two","simulated based","smart urban","spatial characteristics","stronger influences","studies focused","study developed","support urban","systematically investigate","transportation networks","two cities","valuable implications","commercial land","developed machine","development patterns","factors related","previous studies","machine method","rapid urbanization","proposed method","case study","urban planning","urban areas","artificial neural","neural network"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building heights","random forests","spatial factors","urban development","administrative centers","algorithm outperformed","areas comparative","collected detailed","comparative case","detailed information","development patterns","different development","exert stronger","factor associated","factors related","forests algorithm","forests neighbor","important factor","increasingly serious","influence building","information using","issue worldwide","land value","land values","neighbor algorithm","networks exert","new buildings","previous attempts","provide valuable","rarely explored","serious issue","shenzhen overall","shenzhen rapid","shenzhen two","simulated based","smart urban","spatial characteristics","stronger influences","studies focused","study developed","support urban","systematically investigate","transportation networks","two cities","valuable implications","developed machine","previous studies","commercial land","machine method","rapid urbanization","proposed method","urban areas","case study","urban planning","artificial neural","neural network"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building heights","random forests","spatial factors","urban development","administrative centers","algorithm outperformed","areas comparative","artificial neural","collected detailed","comparative case","detailed information","development patterns","different development","exert stronger","factor associated","factors related","forests algorithm","forests neighbor","important factor","increasingly serious","influence building","information using","issue worldwide","land value","land values","neighbor algorithm","networks exert","neural network","new buildings","previous attempts","previous studies","proposed method","provide valuable","rapid urbanization","rarely explored","serious issue","shenzhen overall","shenzhen rapid","shenzhen two","simulated based","smart urban","spatial characteristics","stronger influences","studies focused","study developed","support urban","systematically investigate","transportation networks","two cities","valuable implications","urban planning","case study","commercial land","developed machine","machine method","urban areas"]},{"DocId":173,"Year":2019,"Title":"Investigation of the likelihood of green infrastructure (GI)enhancement along linear waterways or on derelict sites (DS)using machine learning","Abstract":"Studies evaluating the potential for green infrastructure (GI)development using traditional Boolean logic-based multi-criteria analysis methods are not capable of predicting future GI development in dynamic urbanscapes.

The aim of this paper is to examine the extent to which urban expansion is driving changes in landscape structure of the peri-urban fringes of Accra.We submit that rapid peri-urbanisation will fragment the existing agricultural and forested landscape with consequent ecological, socio-economic and urban governance implications. Using Landsat satellite images for the years 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 the study area was classified into four land cover classes. The study adopted the use of Urban Intensity Index (UII) and the Annual Rate of Urbanization (R) as measures of urbanization. Edge density (ED), largest patch index (LPI) and Aggregation index (AI) were used as proxies to measure landscape structural transformations. The study reveals substantial reductions and fragmentation in agricultural lands, riverine and open forests, while there has been over 200 percent increase in built-up areas. Beyond these revelations in spatiotemporal changes in landscape structure, the paper points to the ecological implications of the changes, and three key socio-economic and urban governance implications. \u00a9 2019 G.

However, as various different of approaches to estimate the current distribution of population and dwellings exists, further evidence on past dynamics is needed for a better understanding of urban processes. This article therefore addresses the question of whether and how accurately historical distributions of dwellings and inhabitants can be reconstructed with commonly available geodata from national mapping and cadastral agencies. For this purpose, an approach for the automatic derivation of such information is presented. The data basis is constituted by a current digital landscape model and a 3D building model combined with historical land use information automatically extracted from historical topographic maps. For this purpose, methods of image processing, machine learning, change detection and dasymetric mapping are applied. The results for a study area in Germany show that it is possible to automatically derive decadal historical patterns of population and dwellings from 1950 to 2011 at the level of a 100 m grid with slight underestimations and acceptable standard deviations. By a differentiated analysis we were able to quantify the errors for different urban structure types. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","acceptable standard","accurately historical","automatic derivation","automatically derive","automatically extracted","available geodata","building model","cadastral agencies","change detection","commonly available","current digital","current distribution","dasymetric mapping","data basis","decadal historical","derive decadal","differentiated analysis","digital landscape","disaster management","dwellings based","dwellings exists","energy provision","germany show","historical distributions","historical patterns","historical topographic","image processing","information automatically","landscape model","learning change","mapping dynamics","model combined","morphologies information","national mapping","past dynamics","planning risk","processing machine","provision land","purpose methods","risk assessment","slight underestimations","standard deviations","structure types","topographic maps","urban morphologies","urban processes","urban structure","use information","various different","various fields","different urban","historical land","better understanding","study area","use planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","acceptable standard","accurately historical","automatic derivation","automatically derive","automatically extracted","available geodata","better understanding","building model","cadastral agencies","change detection","commonly available","current digital","current distribution","dasymetric mapping","data basis","decadal historical","derive decadal","differentiated analysis","digital landscape","disaster management","dwellings based","dwellings exists","energy provision","germany show","historical distributions","historical land","historical patterns","historical topographic","image processing","information automatically","landscape model","learning change","mapping dynamics","model combined","morphologies information","national mapping","past dynamics","planning risk","processing machine","provision land","purpose methods","risk assessment","slight underestimations","standard deviations","structure types","topographic maps","urban morphologies","urban processes","use information","various different","various fields","urban structure","use planning","different urban","study area","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","acceptable standard","accurately historical","automatic derivation","automatically derive","automatically extracted","available geodata","building model","cadastral agencies","change detection","commonly available","current digital","current distribution","dasymetric mapping","data basis","decadal historical","derive decadal","different urban","differentiated analysis","digital landscape","disaster management","dwellings based","dwellings exists","energy provision","germany show","historical distributions","historical land","historical patterns","historical topographic","image processing","information automatically","landscape model","learning change","mapping dynamics","model combined","morphologies information","national mapping","past dynamics","planning risk","processing machine","provision land","purpose methods","risk assessment","slight underestimations","standard deviations","structure types","study area","topographic maps","urban morphologies","urban processes","urban structure","use information","use planning","various different","various fields","better understanding","machine learning"]},{"DocId":178,"Year":2017,"Title":"Deep highway unit network for land cover type classification with GF-3 SAR imagery","Abstract":"The fully polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an advanced earth observation system with day and night imaging capability, which can obtain rich information of terrain and has a wide range of applications in environmental protection, urban planning and resource investigation. As the first selfdeveloped C-band multi-polarized SAR image, the acquisition of massive data and operational operation of Chinese SAR remote sensing has entered the era of big data. Under the era of remote sensing large data, however, SAR image interpretation is a great challenge for scientific applications. At present, big data-based intelligent methods such as computer vision technology have achieved great success. Deep learning such as deep highway unit networks has revolutionized the computer vision area. However, due to the characteristics of SAR microwave band imaging and phase coherence processing, SAR images are very different from ordinary optical images in terms of band, projection direction, data composition and so on. Therefore, deep learning can not be directly used for quad-pol SAR image classification. In this paper, deep learning is applied to land cover type classification with GF-3 quad-pol SAR imagery. A deep highway unit network is employed to automatically extract a hierarchic feature representation from the data, based on which the land cover type classification can be conducted. Our classification model is trained on limited training data from forest resource inventory and planning data, and tested on a Radarsat-2 quad-pol images, which is the image of the same area acquired at different times. We also employ the machine learning such as SVM, Random Forest on the same samples for comparison. The deep highway unit network trained by the GF-3 images, which can reduce speckle, fully excavate the regularity of SAR images in time and space. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deep highway","highway unit","cover type","sar image","unit network","type classification","sar imagery","land cover","sar images","deep learning","computer vision","achieved great","advanced earth","area acquired","automatically extract","band imaging","band projection","big intelligent","chinese sar","coherence processing","data composition","different times","direction data","environmental protection","extract hierarchic","forest resource","fully excavate","fully polarized","great challenge","great success","hierarchic feature","imagery deep","imaging capability","intelligent methods","large data","microwave band","network trained","night imaging","observation system","obtain rich","operational operation","ordinary optical","paper deep","phase coherence","planning data","polarized synthetic","present big","processing sar","projection direction","protection urban","reduce speckle","resource inventory","resource investigation","rich information","sar microwave","sar remote","scientific applications","selfdeveloped sar","sensing large","speckle fully","success deep","unit networks","vision area","classification model","feature representation","image interpretation","limited training","massive data","optical images","svm random","vision technology","big data","data based","training data","earth observation","wide range","remote sensing","radar sar","aperture radar","synthetic aperture","random forest","image classification","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deep highway","highway unit","cover type","sar image","unit network","type classification","sar imagery","land cover","sar images","computer vision","deep learning","achieved great","advanced earth","area acquired","automatically extract","band imaging","band projection","big intelligent","chinese sar","coherence processing","data composition","different times","direction data","environmental protection","extract hierarchic","forest resource","fully excavate","fully polarized","great challenge","great success","hierarchic feature","imagery deep","imaging capability","intelligent methods","large data","microwave band","network trained","night imaging","observation system","obtain rich","operational operation","optical images","ordinary optical","paper deep","phase coherence","planning data","polarized synthetic","present big","processing sar","projection direction","protection urban","reduce speckle","resource inventory","resource investigation","rich information","sar microwave","sar remote","scientific applications","selfdeveloped sar","sensing large","speckle fully","success deep","unit networks","vision area","classification model","feature representation","image interpretation","limited training","massive data","svm random","vision technology","big data","data based","radar sar","training data","aperture radar","earth observation","synthetic aperture","wide range","remote sensing","random forest","image classification","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deep highway","highway unit","cover type","sar image","type classification","unit network","land cover","sar imagery","sar images","computer vision","deep learning","achieved great","advanced earth","area acquired","automatically extract","band imaging","band projection","big intelligent","chinese sar","classification model","coherence processing","data based","data composition","different times","direction data","environmental protection","extract hierarchic","forest resource","fully excavate","fully polarized","great challenge","great success","hierarchic feature","image interpretation","imagery deep","imaging capability","intelligent methods","large data","limited training","massive data","microwave band","network trained","night imaging","observation system","obtain rich","operational operation","optical images","ordinary optical","paper deep","phase coherence","planning data","polarized synthetic","present big","processing sar","projection direction","protection urban","reduce speckle","resource inventory","resource investigation","rich information","sar microwave","sar remote","scientific applications","selfdeveloped sar","sensing large","speckle fully","success deep","svm random","unit networks","vision area","vision technology","feature representation","big data","radar sar","random forest","training data","aperture radar","earth observation","synthetic aperture","wide range","remote sensing","image classification","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":179,"Year":2016,"Title":"Thermal sensation prediction by soft computing methodology","Abstract":"Thermal comfort in open urban areas is very factor based on environmental point of view.

Although the urban growth in Athens can be mostly attributed to the expansion of the residential areas, the total coverage by impervious surfaces in the city has been significantly increased during the last decade due to construction and new development projects that took place during the preparation period of the 2004 Olympic Games. In this study, a 20-year Landsat imagery archive (1988-2007) was used to map the dynamics of urban growth in greater Athens area, based on the urbanization rates. The characterization and quantification of urban land-cover changes was performed by applying urban feature extraction techniques based on machine learning classifiers. Such classifiers use inductive learning algorithms to generate production rules from training data. For results validation, remote sensing data of higher spatial resolution than Landsat were used, i.e. Ikonosand ASTER (Advanced Specaborn Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images of the greater Athens agglomeration acquired between 2001 and 2007. The validation procedure involved a set of randomly selected points and overall accuracy of 94.8, 93.3 and 95.9 % for the years 2007, 2004 and 2001, respectively, was observed. Analysis of the results revealed continuing growth of urban features in the study area, particularly in the Messogia plain, where the new international airport of El. Venizelos is located, as well as in the western parts of greater Athens, across the Thriassion industrial area.

We also point out certain key features of the papers which comprise this special issue. In particular, we examine the way in which some of the authors use expert systems to interface existing computer models, thus developing Decision Support Systems (DSS). And we also note the concern in these applications for developing appropriate characterisations of the \"knowledge base\" and the \"inference engine\" through the generation of appropriate rule-based logics which suitably define the problems in question.

However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification (BAIC) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the BAIC were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the BAIC to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest (POI), Road Network (RN), nighttime light (NTL), a combination of POI and RN data (POI_RN), a combination of POI and NTL data (POI_NTL), a combination of RN and NTL data (RN_NTL), and a combination of POI, RN, and NTL data (POI_RN_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and AdaBoost. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 76 to 89%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. The largest F1 value and OA were obtained using the POI_RN_NTL data and AdaBoost, while the largest AUC was obtained using POI_RN_NTL and POI_NTL data against AdaBoost, LR, and RF; and (2) the advantages of the BAIC include its support for multi-source input data, its objective accuracy assessment, and its robust classifiers. The BAIC can quickly and efficiently realize the automatic classification of urban built-up areas at a reasonably low cost and can be readily applied to other urban areas in the world where any kind of POI, RN, or NTL data coverage is available. The results of this study are expected to provide timely and effective reference information for urban planning and urban management departments, and could also potentially be used to develop large-scale maps of urban built-up areas in the future. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ntl data","urban areas","input data","five classifiers","obtained

Remote-sensing based technologies can effectively detect, monitor and quantify urban tree coverage as an alternative to field-based measurements. Automatic extraction of urban land cover features with high accuracy is a challenging task and it demands artificial intelligence workflows for efficiency and thematic quality. In this context, the objective of this research is to map urban tree coverage per cadastral parcel of Sandy Bay, Hobart from very high-resolution aerial orthophoto and LiDAR data using an Object Based Convolution Neural Network (CNN) approach. Instead of manual preparation of a large number of required training samples, automatically classified Object based image analysis (OBIA) output is used as an input samples to train CNN method. Also, CNN output is further refined and segmented using OBIA to assess the accuracy. The result shows 93.2% overall accuracy for refined CNN classification. Similarly, the overlay of improved CNN output with cadastral parcel layer shows that 21.5% of the study area is covered by trees. This research demonstrates that the accuracy of image classification can be improved by using a combination of OBIA and CNN methods. Such a combined method can be used where manual preparation of training samples for CNN is not preferred. Also, our results indicate that the technique can be implemented to calculate parcel level statistics for urban tree coverage that provides meaningful metrics to guide urban planning and land management practices. \u00a9 2019 Authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["tree coverage","urban tree","cadastral parcel","cnn output","manual preparation","urban trees","object

publishing public (open) data has resulted in an ever-growing number of data silos. Hundreds of thousands of datasets have been catalogued and can be accessed at data portals at different administrative levels. However, usually, users do not think in terms of datasets when they search for information. Instead, they are interested in information that is most likely scattered across several datasets. In the world of proprietary incompany data, organizations invest heavily in connecting data in knowledge graphs and\/or store data in data lakes with the intention of having an integrated view of the data for analysis. With the rise of machine learning, it is a common belief that governments can improve their services, for example, by allowing citizens to get answers related to government information from virtual assistants like Alexa or Siri. To provide high-quality answers, these systems need to be fed with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we share our experience of constructing and using the first open government knowledge graph in the Netherlands. Based on the developed demonstrators, we elaborate on the value of having such a graph and demonstrate its use in the context of improved data browsing, multicriteria analysis for urban planning, and the development of location-aware chat bots. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["knowledge graph","knowledge graphs","open data","administrative levels","allowing citizens","answers related","assistants like","browsing multicriteria","chat bots","common belief","connecting data","data browsing","data lakes","data organizations","data portals","data silos","developed demonstrators","different administrative","fifth star","get answers","government information","government knowledge","graphs store","improved data","incompany data","integrated view","invest heavily","kadaster knowledge","like alexa","likely scattered","multicriteria analysis","netherlands based","open government","organizations invest","proprietary incompany","provide answers","public open","publishing public","silos hundreds","store data","usually users","virtual assistants","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["knowledge graph","knowledge graphs","open data","administrative levels","allowing citizens","answers related","assistants like","browsing multicriteria","chat bots","common belief","connecting data","data browsing","data lakes","data organizations","data portals","data silos","developed demonstrators","different administrative","fifth star","get answers","government information","government knowledge","graphs store","improved data","incompany data","integrated view","invest heavily","kadaster knowledge","like alexa","likely scattered","multicriteria analysis","netherlands based","open government","organizations invest","proprietary incompany","provide answers","public open","publishing public","silos hundreds","store data","usually users","virtual assistants","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["knowledge graph","knowledge graphs","open data","administrative levels","allowing citizens","answers related","assistants like","browsing multicriteria","chat bots","common belief","connecting data","data browsing","data lakes","data organizations","data portals","data silos","developed demonstrators","different administrative","fifth star","get answers","government information","government knowledge","graphs store","improved data","incompany data","integrated view","invest heavily","kadaster knowledge","like alexa","likely scattered","multicriteria analysis","netherlands based","open government","organizations invest","proprietary incompany","provide answers","public open","publishing public","silos hundreds","store data","usually users","virtual assistants","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":188,"Year":2019,"Title":"Positive deviance, big data, and development: A systematic literature review","Abstract":"Positive deviance is a growing approach in international development that identifies those within a population who are outperforming their peers in some way, eg, children in low-income families who are well nourished when those around them are not. Analysing and then disseminating the behaviours and other factors underpinning positive deviance are demonstrably effective in delivering development results. However, positive deviance faces a number of challenges that are restricting its diffusion. In this paper, using a systematic literature review, we analyse the current state of positive deviance and the potential for big data to address the challenges facing positive deviance.

While big data cannot solve all the challenges facing positive deviance as a development tool, they could reduce time, cost, and effort; identify positive deviants in new or better ways; and enable positive deviance to break out of its current preoccupation with public health into domains such as agriculture, education, and urban planning.

In this article, we proposed transportation modes classification method based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to discover seven kinds of transportation modes from GPS trajectory data, including walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a taxi, driving a car, taking the subway and taking a train. First, the original trajectories must be divided into some sub trajectories. There is only one transportation mode label in each sub trajectory. Second, the feature vector of sub trajectory is computed including eight basic and three advanced features. These basic features are distance feature, five velocity-related features and two acceleration-related features. Three advanced features are heading change rate (hcr), stop rate (sr) and velocity change rate (vcr), Final, the LightGBM classifier is used to detect the transportation modes automatically. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and decision tree are also used to verify the efficiency of our method. The experiment data are Geolife provided by Microsoft Research Asia. The results show that the LightGBM and XGBoost methods are more accurate than decision tree method and the LightGBM is better than XGBoost at the classification of car, subway and train. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["transportation modes","trajectory data","advanced features","change rate","lightgbm classifier","sub trajectory","three advanced","gps trajectory","gradient boosting","decision tree","basic features","boosting xgboost","car subway","car taking","computed including","cycling taking","data generated","data human","data including","detecting transportation","different transportation","discover seven","distance feature","eight basic","experiment data","extreme gradient","feature five","feature vector","features three","five features","geolife provided","gps devices","hcr stop","heading change","human travel","including eight","including walking","light gradient","machine lightgbm","microsoft research","mode label","modes automatically","modes based","modes classification","original trajectories","prediction urban","provide useful","rate hcr","rate sr","rate vcr","research asia","seven kinds","stop rate","sub trajectories","taking bus","taking taxi","taxi driving","traffic monitoring","trajectory prediction","tree method","two features","useful information","vcr final","velocity change","walking cycling","xgboost methods","boosting machine","bus taking","classification method","driving car","method based","proposed transportation","taking train","transportation mode","travel behavior","results show","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["transportation modes","trajectory data","advanced features","change rate","gps trajectory","gradient boosting","lightgbm classifier","sub trajectory","three advanced","decision tree","basic features","boosting machine","boosting xgboost","car subway","car taking","computed including","cycling taking","data generated","data human","detecting transportation","different transportation","discover seven","distance feature","eight basic","experiment data","extreme gradient","feature five","feature vector","features three","five features","geolife provided","gps devices","hcr stop","heading change","human travel","including eight","including walking","light gradient","machine lightgbm","microsoft research","mode label","modes automatically","modes based","modes classification","original trajectories","prediction urban","provide useful","rate hcr","rate sr","rate vcr","research asia","seven kinds","stop rate","sub trajectories","taking bus","taking taxi","taxi driving","traffic monitoring","trajectory prediction","tree method","two features","useful information","vcr final","velocity change","walking cycling","xgboost methods","bus taking","classification method","data including","driving car","proposed transportation","taking train","transportation mode","travel behavior","method based","results show","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["transportation modes","trajectory data","advanced features","change rate","gradient boosting","lightgbm classifier","sub trajectory","three advanced","decision tree","gps trajectory","basic features","boosting machine","boosting xgboost","car subway","car taking","classification method","computed including","cycling taking","data generated","data human","data including","detecting transportation","different transportation","discover seven","distance feature","eight basic","experiment data","extreme gradient","feature five","feature vector","features three","five features","geolife provided","gps devices","hcr stop","heading change","human travel","including eight","including walking","light gradient","machine lightgbm","method based","microsoft research","mode label","modes automatically","modes based","modes classification","original trajectories","prediction urban","provide useful","rate hcr","rate sr","rate vcr","research asia","seven kinds","stop rate","sub trajectories","taking bus","taking taxi","taxi driving","trajectory prediction","tree method","two features","useful information","vcr final","velocity change","walking cycling","xgboost methods","bus taking","driving car","proposed transportation","taking train","transportation mode","travel behavior","traffic monitoring","results show","urban planning"]},{"DocId":190,"Year":2018,"Title":"Generative growth with \u2018thin\u2019 globalization: Cambridge\u2019s crossover model of innovation","Abstract":"Changes in leading-edge urban and regional development processes and policies signify the rise of the \u2018Quaternary\u2019 or 4.0 Era of economic growth.

Enhancing human mobility prediction using local functions based on public records and SNS data","Abstract":"The quality of life for people in urban regions can be improved by predicting urban human mobility and adjusting urban planning accordingly. In this study, we compared several possible variables to verify whether a gravity model (a human mobility prediction model borrowed from Newtonian mechanics) worked as well in inner-city regions as it did in intra-city regions. We reviewed the resident population, the number of employees, and the number of SNS posts as variables for generating mass values for an urban traffic gravity model. We also compared the straight-line distance, travel distance, and the impact of time as possible distance values. We defined the functions of urban regions on the basis of public records and SNS data to reflect the diverse social factors in urban regions. In this process, we conducted a dimension reduction method for the public record data and used a machine learning-based clustering algorithm for the SNS data. In doing so, we found that functional distance could be defined as the Euclidean distance between social function vectors in urban regions. Finally, we examined whether the functional distance was a variable that had a significant impact on urban human mobility. \u00a9 2018 Kim et al.

Early recognition and prediction of behavioral patterns are of great importance in many societal applications like urban planning, transportation optimization, and health-care. Understanding the relationships between human behaviors and location\u2019s context is an emerging interest for understanding human-environmental dynamics. Growing availability of Web 2.0, i.e. the increasing amount of websites with mainly user created content and social platforms opens up an opportunity to study such location\u2019s contexts. This paper investigates relationships existing between human behavior and location context, by analyzing log mobile phone data records. First an advanced approach to categorize areas in a city based on the presence and distribution of categories of human activity (e.g., eating, working, and shopping) found across the areas, is proposed. The proposed classification is then evaluated through its comparison with the patterns of temporal variation of mobile phone activity and applying machine learning techniques to predict a timeline type of communication activity in a given location based on the knowledge of the obtained category vs. land-use type of the locations areas.

To demonstrate the impact that information technology could have in this area, we leverage techniques from machine learning and computer vision to gather information about the presence and quality of sidewalks in map images. In particular, we identify sidewalk segments in street view images using a random forest classifier, utilizing a set of local and global features that include geometric context, presence of lanes, pixel color, and location. Our results illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segments in a large set of street view images.

The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences.

This study provides new evidence for the links between body mass index (BMI) and the BE at different geographic scales in a unified framework. Based on a sample of 10,962 individuals across 95 cities in China, this study explores the collective effects of the BE attributes at neighborhood and city levels on BMI using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach. Moreover, whether the relationships between the city-level BE attributes and BMI vary across social groups is revealed. The results indicate that the city-level BE attributes have larger collective effects on BMI than the neighborhood-level BE attributes. Specifically, population size is the greatest contributor to predicting BMI, with a relative importance of 13.92% among all influential factors. Moreover, it is found that the effects of city-level BE attributes vary across different social groups. These findings suggest it is of vital importance for urban planners to coordinate both neighborhood- and city-level BE planning to deter the risks of obesity, and urban planning can be more effective if it is implemented considering local socio-demographic characteristics. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["body mass","built environment","collective effects","mass index","social groups","attributes specifically","attributes vary","bmi using","bmi vary","boosting decision","city levels","common goal","comparative roles","considering local","different geographic","different social","essential role","findings suggest","framework based","gbdt approach","geographic scales","gradient boosting","greatest contributor","implemented considering","index bmi","index evidence","influential factors","larger collective","local characteristics","multilevel built","new evidence","population size","predicting bmi","promote health","specifically population","study explores","tree gbdt","unified framework","using gradient","vital importance","provides new","relative importance","results indicate","study provides","decision tree","urban planning","urban planners"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["body mass","built environment","collective effects","mass index","social groups","attributes specifically","attributes vary","bmi using","bmi vary","boosting decision","city levels","common goal","comparative roles","considering local","different geographic","different social","essential role","findings suggest","framework based","gbdt approach","geographic scales","gradient boosting","greatest contributor","implemented considering","index bmi","index evidence","influential factors","larger collective","local characteristics","multilevel built","new evidence","population size","predicting bmi","promote health","specifically population","study explores","tree gbdt","unified framework","using gradient","vital importance","provides new","relative importance","results indicate","study provides","decision tree","urban planners","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["body mass","built environment","collective effects","mass index","social groups","attributes specifically","attributes vary","bmi using","bmi vary","boosting decision","city levels","common goal","comparative roles","considering local","different geographic","different social","essential role","findings suggest","framework based","gbdt approach","geographic scales","gradient boosting","greatest contributor","implemented considering","index bmi","index evidence","influential factors","larger collective","local characteristics","multilevel built","new evidence","population size","predicting bmi","promote health","results indicate","specifically population","study explores","study provides","tree gbdt","unified framework","urban planners","using gradient","vital importance","urban planning","decision tree","provides new","relative importance"]},{"DocId":199,"Year":2020,"Title":"Urban ambient air temperature estimation using hyperlocal data from smart vehicle-borne sensors","Abstract":"High-quality temperature data at a finer spatio-temporal scale is critical for analyzing the risk of heat exposure and hazards in urban environments. The variability of urban landscapes makes cities a challenging environment for quantifying heat exposure. Most of the existing heat hazard studies have inherent limitations on two fronts; first, the spatio-temporal granularities are too coarse, and second, the inability to track the ambient air temperature (AAT) instead of land surface temperature (LST). Overcoming these limitations requires developing models for mapping the variability in heat exposure in urban environments. We investigated an integrated approach for mapping urban heat hazards by harnessing a diverse set of high-resolution measurements, including both ground-based and satellite-based temperature data. We mounted vehicle-borne mobile sensors on city buses to collect high-frequency temperature data throughout 2018 and 2019. Our research also incorporated key biophysical parameters and Landsat 8 LST data into Random Forest regression modeling to map the hyperlocal variability of heat hazard over areas not covered by the buses. The vehicle-borne temperature sensor data showed large temperature differences within the city, with the largest variations of up to 10 \u00b0C and morning-afternoon diurnal changes at a magnitude around 20 \u00b0C. Random Forest modeling on noontime (11:30 am \u2013 12:30 pm) data to predict AAT produced accurate results with a mean absolute error of 0.29 \u00b0C and successfully showcased the enhanced granularity in urban heat hazard mapping. These maps revealed well-defined hyperlocal variabilities in AAT, which were not evident with other research approaches. Urban core and dense residential areas revealed larger than 5 \u00b0C AAT differences from their nearby green spaces. The sensing framework developed in this study can be easily implemented in other urban areas, and findings from this study will be beneficial in understanding the heat vulnerabilities of individual communities. It can be used by the local government to devise targeted hazard mitigation efforts such as increasing green space, developing better heat-safety policies, and exposure warning for workers. \u00a9

urban planning. This paper proposes the geographic information system (GIS)-based emotional computing concept, which is a novel framework for applying GIS methods to collective human emotion. The methodology presented in this paper consists of three key steps: (1) collecting georeferenced data containing emotion and environment information such as social media and official sites, (2) detecting emotions using AI-based emotional computing technics such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), and (3) visualizing and analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns with GIS tools. This methodology is a great synergy of multidisciplinary cutting-edge techniques, such as GIScience, sociology, and computer science. Moreover, it can effectively and deeply explore the connection between people and their surroundings with the help of GIS methods.

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =\u223c130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep\/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities. Ethics and dissemination This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149\/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations.

learning","Abstract":"This paper presents a general framework for modeling the growth of three important variables for cities: population distribution, binary urban footprint, and urban footprint in color. The framework models the population distribution as a spatiotemporal regression problem using machine learning, and it obtains the binary urban footprint from the population distribution through a binary classifier plus a temporal correction for existing urban regions. The framework estimates the urban footprint in color from its previous value, as well as from past and current values of the binary urban footprint using a semantic inpainting algorithm. By combining this framework with free data from the Landsat archive and the Global Human Settlement Layer framework, interested users can get approximate growth predictions of any city in the world. These predictions can be improved with the inclusion in the framework of additional spatially distributed input variables over time subject to availability. Unlike widely used growth models based on cellular automata, there are two main advantages of using the proposed machine learning-based framework. Firstly, it does not require to define rules a priori because the model learns the dynamics of growth directly from the historical data. Secondly, it is very easy to train new machine learning models using different explanatory input variables to assess their impact. As a proof of concept, we tested the framework in Valledupar and Rionegro, two Latin American cities located in Colombia with different geomorphological characteristics, and found that the model predictions were in close agreement with the ground-truth based on performance metrics, such as the root-mean-square error, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient for continuous variables, and a few others for discrete variables such as the intersection over union, accuracy, and the f1 metric. In summary, our framework for modeling urban growth is flexible, allows sensitivity analyses, and can help policymakers worldwide to assess different what-if scenarios during the planning cycle of sustainable and resilient cities. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban footprint","binary urban","population distribution","input variables","using

function of areas of interest (AOIs) is crucial to the identification of urban functional zoning and land use classification, which has been a hot topic in various fields such as urban planning and smart city fields. Most existing studies on urban functional zoning and land use classification either largely rely on low-frequency remote sensing images, which are constrained to the block level due to their spatial scale limitation, or suffer from low accuracy and high uncertainty when using dynamic data, such as social media and traffic data. This paper proposes an hour-day-spectrum (HDS) approach for generating six types of distribution waveforms of taxi pick-up and drop-off points which serve as interpretation indicators of the social functions of AOIs. To achieve this goal, we first performed fine-grained cleaning of the drop-off points to eliminate the spatial errors caused by taxi drivers. Next, buffer and spatial clustering were integrated to explore the associations between travel behavior and AOIs. Third, the identification of AOI types was made by using the standard HDS method combined with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Finally, some matching tests were carried out by similarity indexes of a standard HDS and sample HDS, i.e., the Gaussian kernel function and Pearson coefficient, to ensure matching accuracy. The experiment was conducted in the Chongchuan and Gangzha Districts, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. By training 50 AOI samples, six types of standard HDS of residential districts, schools, hospitals, and shopping malls were obtained. Then, 108 AOI samples were tested, and the overall accuracy was found to be 90.74%. This approach generates value-added services of the taxi trajectory and provides a continuous update and fine-grained supplementary method for the identification of land use types. In addition, the approach is object-oriented and based on AOIs, and can be combined with image interpretation and other methods to improve the identification effect. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["standard hds","land use","aoi samples","functional zoning","interest aois","six types","social functions","urban functional","use classification","algorithm finally","aoi types","aois using","approach generates","automatic identification","block level","city fields","continuous update","distribution waveforms","districts nantong","districts schools","dynamic data","ensure matching","errors caused","gangzha districts","gaussian kernel","generates services","generating six","hds approach","hds method","high uncertainty","hot topic","identification effect","image interpretation","interpretation indicators","jiangsu province","kernel function","knn algorithm","largely rely","level due","low accuracy","matching accuracy","matching tests","method combined","nantong jiangsu","neighbor knn","overall accuracy","pearson coefficient","performed cleaning","provides continuous","province china","residential districts","sample hds","samples six","scale limitation","schools hospitals","sensing images","similarity indexes","spatial errors","standard approach","supplementary method","taxi drivers","taxi trajectory","traffic data","training aoi","travel behavior","using dynamic","various fields","shopping malls","social function","spatial scale","use types","existing studies","paper proposes","remote sensing","smart city","spatial clustering","social media","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["standard hds","land use","aoi samples","functional zoning","interest aois","six types","social functions","urban functional","use classification","algorithm finally","aoi types","aois using","approach generates","automatic identification","block level","city fields","continuous update","distribution waveforms","districts nantong","districts schools","dynamic data","ensure matching","errors caused","existing studies","gangzha districts","gaussian kernel","generates services","generating six","hds approach","hds method","high uncertainty","hot topic","identification effect","image interpretation","interpretation indicators","jiangsu province","kernel function","knn algorithm","largely rely","level due","low accuracy","matching accuracy","matching tests","method combined","nantong jiangsu","neighbor knn","overall accuracy","paper proposes","pearson coefficient","performed cleaning","provides continuous","province china","remote sensing","residential districts","sample hds","samples six","scale limitation","schools hospitals","sensing images","shopping malls","similarity indexes","smart city","spatial clustering","spatial errors","spatial scale","standard approach","supplementary method","taxi drivers","taxi trajectory","traffic data","training aoi","travel behavior","use types","using dynamic","various fields","social function","social media","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["standard hds","land use","aoi samples","functional zoning","interest aois","six types","social functions","use classification","urban functional","algorithm finally","aoi types","aois using","approach generates","automatic identification","block level","city fields","continuous update","distribution waveforms","districts nantong","districts schools","dynamic data","ensure matching","errors caused","gangzha districts","gaussian kernel","generates services","generating six","hds approach","hds method","high uncertainty","hot topic","identification effect","image interpretation","interpretation indicators","jiangsu province","kernel function","knn algorithm","largely rely","level due","low accuracy","matching accuracy","matching tests","method combined","nantong jiangsu","neighbor knn","overall accuracy","paper proposes","pearson coefficient","performed cleaning","provides continuous","province china","residential districts","sample hds","samples six","scale limitation","schools hospitals","sensing images","similarity indexes","smart city","social media","spatial clustering","spatial errors","spatial scale","standard approach","supplementary method","taxi drivers","taxi trajectory","traffic data","training aoi","travel behavior","using dynamic","various fields","existing studies","remote sensing","shopping malls","social function","use types","urban planning"]},{"DocId":204,"Year":2019,"Title":"Understanding the spatial distribution of urban forests in China using Sentinel-2 images with Google Earth Engine","Abstract":"Urban forests are vitally important for sustainable urban development and the well-being of urban residents. However, there is, as yet, no country-level urban forest spatial dataset of sufficient quality for the scientific management of, and correlative studies on, urban forests in China. At present, China attaches great importance to the construction of urban forests, and it is necessary to map a high-resolution and high-accuracy dataset of urban forests in China. The open-access Sentinel images and the Google Earth Engine platform provide a significant opportunity for the realization of this work. This study used eight bands (B2-B8, B11) and three indices of Sentinel-2 in 2016 to map the urban forests of China using the Random Forest machine learning algorithms at the pixel scale with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The 7317 sample points for training and testing were collected from field visits and very high resolution images from Google Earth. The overall accuracy, producer's accuracy of urban forest, and user's accuracy of urban forest assessed by independent validation samples in this study were 92.30%, 92.27%, and 92.18%, respectively. In 2016, the percentage of urban forest cover was 19.2%. Nearly half of the cities had an urban forest cover between 10% and 20%, and the average percentage of large cities whose urban populations were over 5 million was 24.8%. Cities with less than half of the average were mainly distributed in northern and western parts of China, which should be focused on in urban greening planning. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban forests","urban forest","google earth","earth engine","china using","forest cover","accuracy producer","attaches great","average percentage","china attaches","correlative studies","eight bands","engine platform","engine urban","field visits","forest assessed","forest machine","forest spatial","greening planning","independent validation","large cities","nearly half","pixel scale","platform provide","present china","provide significant","resolution images","sample points","scientific management","sentinel images","significant opportunity","spatial dataset","sufficient quality","three indices","urban greening","urban populations","urban residents","user accuracy","validation samples","vitally important","great importance","mainly distributed","producer accuracy","sustainable urban","using images","western parts","engine gee","high resolution","spatial distribution","learning algorithms","urban development","overall accuracy","random forest","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban forests","urban forest","google earth","earth engine","china using","forest cover","accuracy producer","attaches great","average percentage","china attaches","correlative studies","eight bands","engine platform","engine urban","field visits","forest assessed","forest machine","forest spatial","great importance","greening planning","independent validation","large cities","mainly distributed","nearly half","pixel scale","platform provide","present china","provide significant","resolution images","sample points","scientific management","significant opportunity","spatial dataset","spatial distribution","sufficient quality","sustainable urban","three indices","urban development","urban greening","urban populations","urban residents","user accuracy","validation samples","vitally important","western parts","producer accuracy","sentinel images","using images","engine gee","high resolution","learning algorithms","overall accuracy","random forest","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban forests","urban forest","google earth","earth engine","china using","forest cover","accuracy producer","attaches great","average percentage","china attaches","correlative studies","eight bands","engine gee","engine platform","engine urban","field visits","forest assessed","forest machine","forest spatial","great importance","greening planning","independent validation","large cities","mainly distributed","nearly half","pixel scale","platform provide","present china","provide significant","resolution images","sample points","scientific management","sentinel images","significant opportunity","spatial dataset","spatial distribution","sufficient quality","sustainable urban","three indices","urban greening","urban populations","urban residents","user accuracy","using images","validation samples","vitally important","western parts","producer accuracy","urban development","high resolution","learning algorithms","overall accuracy","random forest","machine learning"]},{"DocId":205,"Year":2019,"Title":"Attention based stack resnet for citywide traffic accident prediction","Abstract":"The fine-grained citywide traffic accident prediction is of great significance for urban traffic management.

Data-driven approaches also fall short while interpreting trajectories where ground truth information is limited. Therefore, this paper develops a novel knowledge-based approach for interpreting smartphone global positioning system trajectories by detecting various transport modes used during travel. The proposed model is based on an expert system that can work without any training, based solely on expert knowledge. Core is a fuzzy multiple-input multiple-output expert system using kinematic and spatial information with a well explained fuzzy reasoning scheme through a fuzzy rule base. The model can provide alternate predictions with varied certainty factors.

Capturing citizens\u2019 ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics\/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens\u2019 inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs\/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered\/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth\/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["sentiment

generation capacity planning and also to integrate environment friendly energy sources at district level. Load predictions will help in developing demand side management in coordination with renewable power generation. Urban area load is influenced by meteorological conditions therefore it is important to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting. This paper explores the use of regression tool for regional electric load forecasting by correlating lower distinctive categorical level (season and day of the week) and weather parameters. The historical electrical load datasets with meteorological parameters are available for the Sydney region and they have been used to test the regression tools. Data correlation over seasonal changes have been argued by means of improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE). By examining the structure of various regressors they are compared for the lowest MAPE. The regressors show good MAPE for short term (30 min) prediction and Random Forest Regressor scores best in the range of 1-2 % MAPE. \u00a9 2018 University of Split, FESB.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["load forecasting","electrical load","load predictions","electric load","power generation","regional electric","regression tools","short term","term min","weather parameters","urban area","area electrical","area load","big amount","binary dummy","capacity planning","categorical level","complex predictor","correlating lower","data correlation","data neighbour","demand side","developing demand","distinctive categorical","district level","dummy variables","effectively contribute","energy sources","environment friendly","forecasting urban","forest regressor","friendly energy","generation capacity","generation urban","good mape","historical electrical","hours load","improving mean","include weather","integrate environment","level load","level season","load datasets","load prediction","lower distinctive","meteorological conditions","meteorological parameters","min prediction","neighbour knn","paper explores","predictions machine","regression tool","regressor scores","regressors show","renewable power","scores best","seasonal changes","show good","side management","sydney region","term hours","tools data","utilizes big","various regressors","long term","lowest mape","network ann","training data","error mape","absolute percentage","percentage error","artificial neural","learning algorithms","mean absolute","neural network","random forest","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["load forecasting","electrical load","load predictions","electric load","power generation","regional electric","regression tools","short term","term min","weather parameters","urban area","absolute percentage","area electrical","area load","big amount","binary dummy","capacity planning","categorical level","complex predictor","correlating lower","data correlation","data neighbour","demand side","developing demand","distinctive categorical","district level","dummy variables","effectively contribute","energy sources","environment friendly","error mape","forecasting urban","forest regressor","friendly energy","generation capacity","generation urban","good mape","historical electrical","hours load","improving mean","include weather","integrate environment","level load","level season","load datasets","load prediction","long term","lower distinctive","meteorological conditions","meteorological parameters","min prediction","neighbour knn","network ann","neural network","paper explores","percentage error","predictions machine","regression tool","regressor scores","regressors show","renewable power","scores best","seasonal changes","show good","side management","sydney region","term hours","tools data","utilizes big","various regressors","artificial neural","learning algorithms","lowest mape","mean absolute","training data","random forest","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["load forecasting","electrical load","load predictions","electric load","power generation","regional electric","regression tools","short term","term min","weather parameters","urban area","area electrical","area load","big amount","binary dummy","capacity planning","categorical level","complex predictor","correlating lower","data correlation","data neighbour","demand side","developing demand","distinctive categorical","district level","dummy variables","effectively contribute","energy sources","environment friendly","forecasting urban","forest regressor","friendly energy","generation capacity","generation urban","good mape","historical electrical","hours load","improving mean","include weather","integrate environment","level load","level season","load datasets","load prediction","long term","lower distinctive","meteorological conditions","meteorological parameters","min prediction","neighbour knn","network ann","paper explores","predictions machine","regression tool","regressor scores","regressors show","renewable power","scores best","seasonal changes","show good","side management","sydney region","term hours","tools data","utilizes big","various regressors","absolute percentage","artificial neural","error mape","lowest mape","neural network","training data","learning algorithms","mean absolute","percentage error","random forest","machine learning"]},{"DocId":210,"Year":2018,"Title":"Deep neural network dynamic traffic routing system for vehicles","Abstract":"Traffic grids have always suffered from a lack of dynamic routing and path planning algorithms and relied only on static characteristics of the roads like the number of lanes, distance and speed limits to avoid and resolve traffic congestion, by routing traffic to a lighter traffic path.

To understand cities at scale, crowdsourcing games have been employed successfully to evaluate citizens' opinions about cities and urban scenes. By analyzing human perceptions from residents of a mid-sized Brazilian city, this work brings three novel contributions. First, we consider theories from urban design to explore through crowdsourcing which high and low level features in an urban space are linked to perceptions of safety and pleasantness. Secondly, this paper leverages theory from urban sociology and anthropology to show how the sociodemographic pro.le of the citizens signi.cantly mediate their perception of safeness and pleasantness of places. Finally, we show that features of the urban form proposed by urbanists can be combined with sociodemographics to improve the accuracy of machine learning models that predict which scene a person will .nd more safe or pleasant. .is last result paves the road for more personalized recommendations in cold-start scenarios. \u00a9 2017 ACM.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["analyzing human","brazilian city","brings three","citizens mediate","citizens opinions","city life","city understanding","city unveiling","computational models","consider theories","crowdsourcing game","crowdsourcing games","employed successfully","evaluate citizens","factors shape","form proposed","improving city","level features","leverages theory","low level","multiple images","novel contributions","paper leverages","perception informs","personalized recommendations","places finally","pleasantness secondly","result paves","scale crowdsourcing","scene person","three novel","understand cities","unveiling urban","urban sociology","work brings","urban perceptions","urban scenes","human perceptions","urban spaces","urban form","urban space","learning models","public spaces","urban planners","urban design","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["analyzing human","brazilian city","brings three","citizens mediate","citizens opinions","city life","city understanding","city unveiling","computational models","consider theories","crowdsourcing game","crowdsourcing games","employed successfully","evaluate citizens","factors shape","form proposed","human perceptions","improving city","learning models","level features","leverages theory","low level","multiple images","novel contributions","paper leverages","perception informs","personalized recommendations","places finally","pleasantness secondly","result paves","scale crowdsourcing","scene person","three novel","understand cities","unveiling urban","urban perceptions","urban scenes","urban sociology","work brings","urban form","urban planners","urban spaces","urban design","urban space","public spaces","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["analyzing human","brazilian city","brings three","citizens mediate","citizens opinions","city life","city understanding","city unveiling","computational models","consider theories","crowdsourcing game","crowdsourcing games","employed successfully","evaluate citizens","factors shape","form proposed","human perceptions","improving city","learning models","level features","leverages theory","low level","multiple images","novel contributions","paper leverages","perception informs","personalized recommendations","places finally","pleasantness secondly","result paves","scale crowdsourcing","scene person","three novel","understand cities","unveiling urban","urban perceptions","urban planners","urban scenes","urban sociology","work brings","urban design","urban form","urban space","urban spaces","public spaces","machine learning"]},{"DocId":213,"Year":2017,"Title":"An Evaluation Index for Cross Ventilation Based on CFD Simulations and Ventilation Prediction Model Using Machine Learning algorithms","Abstract":"High-density cities usually surfer deterioration of the urban built environment due to slow or stagnant air movement. This deterioration could be mitigated by improved urban natural ventilation through good urban planning and building design. However, indoor natural ventilation requirements in current building standards only define absolute indoor air speed without considering outdoor conditions. To fill this gap, this paper developed generic urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor CFD models and proposes a new integrated index (CIOI index) to evaluate indoor natural ventilation potential, which couples both indoor and outdoor wind environments. CIOIv regression models are developed by applying machine learning algorithms based on 3,840 CFD simulation results. The Gradient Boosting (GB) model shows an improved performance in terms of higher correlation (R2=0.8) and lower errors (MAPE=16%) compared with the multivariate linear regression model. Building designers and urban planners can use this CIOI prediction model to quickly check, in the early design stage, the influence of their design variations on indoor ventilation potential. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Both classification and regression schemes are examined using the random forest algorithm. In both approaches, the localization performance depends mostly on arrival time information of received signals. It is shown that the use of a relative arrival time difference rather than the direct time of arrival (TOA) also provide good performance, which is beneficial for practical application. It is found that with enough number of receivers, the signal power parameter can be omitted, which eliminates frequency dependency of developed models. It is also found that at least three receivers should be used to achieve acceptable prediction performance. Additionally, the number of training examples needed depends on the approach used as well as the desired level of accuracy. This factor is more important in the classification approach, as the amount of training data required closely relates to the number of sectors created by the localization problem. A regression scheme is more natural for predicting spatial coordinate values, and achieved higher localization accuracy with fewer training examples as compared to classification. Ultimately, the regression based localization scheme using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) parameter at three receiver locations achieved an average localization accuracy of 2.8m. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["arrival time","localization accuracy","source localization","time difference","training examples","urban environments","acceptable prediction","achieve acceptable","achieved higher","arrival tdoa","arrival toa","average localization","based localization","classification approach","classification ultimately","closely relates","coordinate values","data required","desired level","developed models","direct time","eliminates frequency","examined using","examples needed","fewer training","forest algorithm","frequency dependency","higher localization","investigates source","localization performance","localization problem","locations achieved","needed depends","paper investigates","performance additionally","performance depends","power parameter","practical application","predicting spatial","problem regression","provide good","receiver locations","regression based","regression scheme","regression schemes","relative arrival","required closely","scheme using","sectors created","signal power","spatial coordinate","tdoa parameter","three receiver","three receivers","environments using","good performance","localization scheme","prediction performance","received signals","time information","using machine","training data","learning methods","random forest","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["arrival time","localization accuracy","source localization","time difference","training examples","acceptable prediction","achieve acceptable","achieved higher","arrival tdoa","arrival toa","average localization","based localization","classification approach","classification ultimately","closely relates","coordinate values","data required","desired level","developed models","direct time","eliminates frequency","examined using","examples needed","fewer training","forest algorithm","frequency dependency","good performance","higher localization","investigates source","localization performance","localization problem","locations achieved","needed depends","paper investigates","performance additionally","performance depends","power parameter","practical application","predicting spatial","problem regression","provide good","receiver locations","regression based","regression scheme","regression schemes","relative arrival","required closely","scheme using","sectors created","signal power","spatial coordinate","tdoa parameter","three receiver","three receivers","time information","urban environments","machine learning","environments using","localization scheme","prediction performance","received signals","random forest","training data","using machine","learning methods"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["arrival time","localization accuracy","source localization","time difference","training examples","acceptable prediction","achieve acceptable","achieved higher","arrival tdoa","arrival toa","average localization","based localization","classification approach","classification ultimately","closely relates","coordinate values","data required","desired level","developed models","direct time","eliminates frequency","examined using","examples needed","fewer training","forest algorithm","frequency dependency","good performance","higher localization","investigates source","localization performance","localization problem","locations achieved","needed depends","paper investigates","performance additionally","performance depends","power parameter","practical application","predicting spatial","problem regression","provide good","receiver locations","regression based","regression scheme","regression schemes","relative arrival","required closely","scheme using","sectors created","signal power","spatial coordinate","tdoa parameter","three receiver","three receivers","time information","urban environments","machine learning","environments using","localization scheme","prediction performance","received signals","random forest","training data","using machine","learning methods"]},{"DocId":215,"Year":2016,"Title":"Intelligent driver assist system for urban driving","Abstract":"Driving in an urban environment is hectic and often adventurous.

The smart navigation employs an on line traffic simulator which provides traffic predictions and improves the accuracy of existing navigation systems which rely on limited traffic data. The intelligent parking assist system predicts the availability of parking at the start of the journey and these predictions get updated as the destination is approached. The system uses machine learning to understand the habits and preferences of the individual driver so that the preferred parking availability information is presented to the driver. The driver diagnostics part learns the driving characteristics of the driver i.e. whether aggressive, semi aggressive or passive, reaction times, following distances etc. and provides this information to the smart navigation and parking assist system for better estimation of travel times.

The proposed method handles problems that arise in large scale urban environments due to acquisition conditions (static and dynamic objects\/pedestrians) combined with the continuous acquisition of data along the vehicles direction, the varying light conditions and strong occlusions (due to the presence of trees, traffic signs, cars, etc.) giving rise to high intra-class variability. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset of high resolution images collected from two main avenues from the 12th district in Paris and the approach shows promising results. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["georeferenced images","urban environments","acquisition conditions","approach shows","bossa representation","bow model","class shops","classification consisting","conditions static","continuous acquisition","dynamic combined","environments due","given image","giving rise","handles problems","high variability","images collected","large dataset","light conditions","main avenues","matching scheme","method handles","occlusions due","paper addresses","semantic image","shops vegetation","shows promising","signs cars","strong occlusions","traffic signs","trees traffic","two main","variability experiments","varying light","vehicles direction","words bow","challenging problem","pyramid matching","resolution images","scale urban","urban context","urban scenes","large scale","promising results","spatial pyramid","scene classification","learning techniques","high resolution","image classification","proposed method","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["georeferenced images","urban environments","acquisition conditions","approach shows","bossa representation","bow model","class shops","classification consisting","conditions static","continuous acquisition","dynamic combined","environments due","given image","giving rise","handles problems","high variability","images collected","large dataset","light conditions","main avenues","matching scheme","method handles","occlusions due","paper addresses","semantic image","shops vegetation","shows promising","signs cars","strong occlusions","traffic signs","trees traffic","two main","variability experiments","varying light","vehicles direction","words bow","challenging problem","pyramid matching","resolution images","scale urban","urban context","urban scenes","large scale","promising results","spatial pyramid","scene classification","high resolution","image classification","learning techniques","proposed method","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["georeferenced images","urban environments","acquisition conditions","approach shows","bossa representation","bow model","challenging problem","class shops","classification consisting","conditions static","continuous acquisition","dynamic combined","environments due","given image","giving rise","handles problems","high resolution","high variability","image classification","images collected","large dataset","large scale","learning techniques","light conditions","main avenues","matching scheme","method handles","occlusions due","paper addresses","promising results","pyramid matching","resolution images","scale urban","semantic image","shops vegetation","shows promising","signs cars","spatial pyramid","strong occlusions","traffic signs","trees traffic","two main","urban context","urban scenes","variability experiments","varying light","vehicles direction","words bow","machine learning","proposed method","scene classification"]},{"DocId":218,"Year":2011,"Title":"Procedural lot generation for evolutionary urban layout optimization in urban regeneration decision support","Abstract":"Decision support in urban regeneration planning involves fulfilment of complex design objectives that require a close collaboration between stakeholders, designers and planners. The objectives are to achieve computationally optimized design plans that are environmentally robust and sustainable. For the purpose of pre-planning analysis and optimization of such design models, the construction framework of the whole system development life cycle is simulated using specialist analysis tools. In the analysis and design phase of such a construction process, location allocation of built environment structures integrated with AI based urban assessment models remain a cumbersome task. With the advent of sophisticated computing hardware and 3D modelling techniques, it has become viable to visualize and develop simulation outcomes with ease over standard computers. However, creation of simulated outcomes with huge urban details still remains a daunting task. With the advent of knowledge-based data standards and mining techniques, possibilities have arisen to integrate procedural urban modelling frameworks with socio-economic deprivation assessment systems to create massive city models in order to improve sustainability and smart growth. The implementation of a procedural modelling framework offers a promising area of research in location allocation optimization of residential and public service structures for urban regeneration planning and collaboration purposes but is still largely stochastic in nature until now. The work presented in this article proposes an L-system-based automated urban layout generation module in addition to an evolutionary building placement optimization system for the purpose of urban regeneration decision support. The location allocation optimization of a highly accessible pedestrian and street network grid still remains a complex process especially with neighbourhoods suffering from severe socio-economic deprivation. Using an extension to 'L-systems', the module utilizes an 'mBPMOL' system to recursively subdivide an urban regeneration layout and later encode the layout to a genetic chromosome to iteratively place a range of urban structures to the lots. Moving further, the system implements a distance-based socio-economic deprivation minimization fitness function and assesses subsequent individual genetic solutions to search for an optimized layout. The development of such an online procedural framework is a very first attempt to employ the capabilities of procedural automation with evolutionary computation to automatically generate and optimize the placement of a large number of building models. The outcome achieved a set of relatively optimal solutions with evaluation based upon a distance-based fitness objective function of various public service structures. The solutions (layout plans) thus obtained offered a number of moderate to highly accessible alternatives. Development of such a system is meant to facilitate decision support and improve time efficiency among urban designers and planners. \u00a9 2011 The

Fully-convolutional-network-based methods have provided a paradigm for automatically extracting buildings from high-resolution imagery. However, high intraclass variance and complexity are two problems in building extraction. It is hard to identify different scales of buildings by using a single receptive field. For this purpose, in this article, we use the stable encoder- decoder architecture, combined with a grid-based attention gate and atrous spatial pyramid pooling module, to capture and restore features progressively and effectively. A modified ResNet50 encoder is also applied to extract features. The proposed method could learn gated features and distinguish buildings from complex surroundings such as trees. We evaluate our model on two building datasets, WHU aerial building dataset and our DB UAV rural building dataset. Experiments show that our model outperforms other five most recent models.

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale.

The current policy framework to ensure the quality of life of inhabitants leaving no one behind, leads decision-makers to seek better-informed choices for the sustainable planning of urban areas. Thus, a better understanding between the spatial structure of cities and their socio-economic level is of crucial relevance. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to quantify this two-way relationship. Therefore, we measured spatial patterns of 31 cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We rely on spatial pattern metrics derived from a Local Climate Zone classification obtained by fusing remote sensing and open GIS data with a machine learning approach. Based upon the data, we quantified the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and socio-economic variables related to \u2018education\u2019, \u2018health\u2019, \u2018living conditions\u2019, \u2018labor\u2019, and \u2018transport\u2019 by means of multiple linear regression models, explaining the variability of the socio-economic variables from 43% up to 82%.

A recently developed ensemble machine learning building classification model is applied for the first time to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to Nigeria. The model is informed by building footprint and label data of greater completeness and attribute consistency than have previously been available for these countries. A GIS workflow is described that semiautomates the preparation of data for input to the model. The workflow is designed to be particularly useful to those who apply the model to additional countries and use input data from diverse sources. Results show that the ensemble model correctly classifies between 85% and 93% of structures as residential and nonresidential across both countries.

These factors have caused destruction of natural habitat and increased natural hazards such as flooding in the Municipality. Monitoring land use\/land cover change is essential in respect to the dynamics of both human and natural factors that affect the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land surface. This research investigates the transitions among the major land use\/land cover categories in the Municipality as a highly populated urban region that is facing some environmental challenges such as deforestation and degradation of the environment. Random Forest was adopted for the classification of 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 land cover maps while the analysis of the dynamics was conducted using intensity analysis. The unique contribution of this article is the combine usage of machine learning algorithm and intensity analysis to assess the changes in land use\/land cover.

However, due to the lack of complete directly measured data on urban traffic flow, existing studies cannot adequately mine the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations characterizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Electronic registration identification (ERI), which is an emerging technology for uniquely identifying a vehicle, can help collect the travel records of all vehicles. This inspires us to employ ERI big data for traffic flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spatial-temporal feature optimization method with ERI big data for short-term traffic flow prediction based on a gradient\u2013boosted regression tree, called DSTO-GBRT. Firstly, the framework of DSTO-GBRT is built. Secondly, we analyze the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations among the current prediction point and upstream correlative points using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Thirdly, to eliminate the linear correlations among features, we exploit principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the original training data and obtain optimized training data. In the experiment, real-world ERI big data from Chongqing are employed for the proposed DSTO-GBRT method. Compared with ST-GBRT, ARIMA, DSTO-BPNN and DSTO-SVM, the results demonstrate that DSTO-GBRT can provide timely and adaptive prediction even in rush hour, when traffic conditions change rapidly. Furthermore, compared with DSO-GBRT and DTO-GBRT, the results show that the proposed DSTO-GBRT method is more accurate. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["eri big","flow prediction","traffic flow","big data","dynamic correlations","dynamic feature","feature optimization","training data","proposed method","accurate traffic","adaptive prediction","analysis pca","built secondly","called firstly","change rapidly","characterizing traffic","coefficient pcc","complete directly","component analysis","conditions change","correlation coefficient","correlations characterizing","correlative points","current prediction","directly measured","electronic registration","emerging technology","employ eri","existing studies","experiment eri","exploit principal","flow existing","help collect","identification eri","identifying vehicle","important basis","linear correlations","measured data","method compared","networks electronic","obtain optimized","optimization method","optimized training","original training","pcc thirdly","pearson correlation","planning applications","points using","prediction accurate","prediction based","prediction point","principal component","propose dynamic","provide timely","registration identification","regression tree","results demonstrate","rush hour","traffic flows","transportation operations","travel records","tree called","uniquely identifying","upstream correlative","road networks","urban road","traffic conditions","transportation systems","intelligent transportation","results show","urban traffic","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["eri big","traffic flow","flow prediction","big data","dynamic correlations","dynamic feature","feature optimization","training data","proposed method","accurate traffic","adaptive prediction","built secondly","called firstly","change rapidly","characterizing traffic","coefficient pcc","complete directly","component analysis","conditions change","correlation coefficient","correlations characterizing","correlative points","current prediction","directly measured","electronic registration","emerging technology","employ eri","existing studies","experiment eri","exploit principal","flow existing","help collect","identification eri","identifying vehicle","important basis","linear correlations","measured data","method compared","networks electronic","obtain optimized","optimization method","optimized training","original training","pcc thirdly","pearson correlation","planning applications","points using","prediction accurate","prediction based","prediction point","principal component","propose dynamic","provide timely","registration identification","regression tree","road networks","rush hour","traffic flows","travel records","tree called","uniquely identifying","upstream correlative","analysis pca","traffic conditions","transportation operations","transportation systems","urban road","intelligent transportation","results demonstrate","results show","urban traffic","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["eri big","traffic flow","flow prediction","big data","dynamic correlations","dynamic feature","feature optimization","proposed method","training data","accurate traffic","adaptive prediction","analysis pca","built secondly","called firstly","change rapidly","characterizing traffic","coefficient pcc","complete directly","component analysis","conditions change","correlation coefficient","correlations characterizing","correlative points","current prediction","directly measured","electronic registration","emerging technology","employ eri","existing studies","experiment eri","exploit principal","flow existing","help collect","identification eri","identifying vehicle","important basis","linear correlations","measured data","method compared","networks electronic","obtain optimized","optimization method","optimized training","original training","pcc thirdly","pearson correlation","planning applications","points using","prediction accurate","prediction based","prediction point","principal component","propose dynamic","provide timely","registration identification","regression tree","road networks","rush hour","traffic flows","travel records","tree called","uniquely identifying","upstream correlative","results demonstrate","traffic conditions","transportation operations","urban road","transportation systems","intelligent transportation","urban traffic","results show","urban planning"]},{"DocId":226,"Year":2020,"Title":"Deep neural network analyses of water quality time series associated with water sensitive urban design (WSUD) features","Abstract":"The abilities of Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated recurrent units (GRU), Adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Artificial neural networks (ANN), and Group method of data handling (GMDH) in predicting water quality time series associated with a cleansing biotope were evaluated.

Previous studies have generally divided study areas into several sub-areas with similar features by artificial or clustering algorithms and then developed models for these sub-areas separately using statistical methods. These approaches have drawbacks due to their subjectivity and uncertainty. In this paper, we present a study of population spatialization in Beijing City, China based on multisource remote sensing data and town-level population census data. Six predictive algorithms were compared for estimating population using the spatial variables derived from The National Polar-Orbiting Partnership\/ Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP\/VIIRS) night-time light and other remote sensing data. Random forest achieved the highest accuracy and therefore was employed for population spatialization. Feature selection was performed to determine the optimal variable combinations for population modeling by random forest. Cross-validation results indicated that the developed model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2129.52 people\/km2 and a R2 of 0.63. The gridded population density in Beijing at a spatial resolution of 500 m produced by the random forest model was also adjusted to be consistent with the census population at the town scale. By comparison with Google Earth high-resolution images, the remotely-sensed population was qualitatively validated at the intra-town scale. Validation results indicated that remotely sensed results can effectively depict the spatial distribution of population within town-level districts. This study provides a valuable reference for urban planning, public health and disaster prevention in Beijing, and a reference for population mapping in other cities. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["population spatialization","sensing data","multisource remote","beijing city","remote sensing","results indicated","random forest","achieved mean","census population","china based","city based","clustering algorithms","data random","data six","developed model","developed models","divided study","drawbacks due","effectively depict","estimating population","feature selection","forest achieved","forest results","generally divided","highest accuracy","model achieved","national visible","optimal variable","planning public","population census","population modeling","population using","predictive algorithms","provides valuable","public health","qualitatively validated","scale validation","sensed results","separately using","similar features","six predictive","spatial variables","spatialization feature","spatialization previous","statistical methods","suite light","town scale","valuable reference","variable combinations","variables derived","visible infrared","census data","data remote","disaster prevention","earth images","gridded population","imaging radiometer","infrared imaging","population mapping","radiometer suite","study provides","using statistical","validation results","absolute error","error mae","forest model","mean absolute","present study","city china","previous studies","spatial distribution","spatial resolution","study areas","google earth","population density","remotely sensed","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["population spatialization","sensing data","remote sensing","beijing city","multisource remote","random forest","results indicated","absolute error","achieved mean","census population","china based","city based","city china","clustering algorithms","data random","data six","developed model","developed models","disaster prevention","divided study","drawbacks due","earth images","effectively depict","error mae","estimating population","feature selection","forest achieved","forest results","generally divided","google earth","highest accuracy","imaging radiometer","infrared imaging","mean absolute","model achieved","national visible","optimal variable","planning public","population census","population density","population modeling","population using","predictive algorithms","present study","previous studies","provides valuable","public health","qualitatively validated","radiometer suite","scale validation","sensed results","separately using","similar features","six predictive","spatial distribution","spatial variables","spatialization feature","spatialization previous","statistical methods","study provides","suite light","town scale","using statistical","validation results","valuable reference","variable combinations","variables derived","visible infrared","census data","data remote","forest model","gridded population","population mapping","spatial resolution","study areas","remotely sensed","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["population spatialization","sensing data","remote sensing","beijing city","multisource remote","random forest","results indicated","absolute error","achieved mean","census population","china based","city based","city china","clustering algorithms","data random","data six","developed model","developed models","disaster prevention","divided study","drawbacks due","earth images","effectively depict","error mae","estimating population","feature selection","forest achieved","forest results","generally divided","google earth","highest accuracy","imaging radiometer","infrared imaging","mean absolute","model achieved","national visible","optimal variable","planning public","population census","population density","population modeling","population using","predictive algorithms","present study","previous studies","provides valuable","public health","qualitatively validated","radiometer suite","scale validation","sensed results","separately using","similar features","six predictive","spatial distribution","spatial variables","spatialization feature","spatialization previous","statistical methods","study provides","suite light","town scale","using statistical","validation results","valuable reference","variable combinations","variables derived","visible infrared","census data","data remote","forest model","gridded population","population mapping","spatial resolution","study areas","remotely sensed","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":229,"Year":2020,"Title":"Machine learning-based and 3d kinematic models for rockfall hazard assessment using LiDAR Data and GIS","Abstract":"Rockfall is one of the most hazardous phenomena in mountainous and hilly regions with high and steep terrain. Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment. \u00a9 2020 by the

This article argues that these regulation efforts, contrary to conventional top-down steering approaches, rely on central-local collaboration and network coordination that involves a number of multiple actors operating under the \u2018shadow of hierarchy\u2019 of the central party-state. \u00a9 2020 Zhejiang University.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["article argues","platform economy","sharing economy","actors operating","ai economy","ai landscape","ai strategy","approaches rely","argues facilitated","article engages","cement central","central authority","china national","china starting","chinese ai","chinese government","city brains","conventional steering","country artificial","country sharing","development road","economy innovation","economy offering","economy platform","efforts contrary","emerging private","governance dilemmas","government official","innovation drive","involves number","multiple actors","national development","network coordination","new mode","offering smart","official quest","officially proclaimed","people republic","private ai","private platform","proclaimed readjustment","regulating sharing","regulation efforts","road map","smart solutions","smart urbanization","steer china","steering approaches","strengthen control","urbanization regulating","city initiatives","complex urban","urban governance","intelligence ai","smart city","artificial intelligence"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["article argues","platform economy","sharing economy","actors operating","ai economy","ai landscape","ai strategy","approaches rely","argues facilitated","article engages","cement central","central authority","china national","china starting","chinese ai","chinese government","city brains","city initiatives","complex urban","conventional steering","country artificial","country sharing","development road","economy innovation","economy offering","economy platform","efforts contrary","emerging private","governance dilemmas","government official","innovation drive","involves number","multiple actors","national development","network coordination","new mode","offering smart","official quest","officially proclaimed","people republic","private ai","private platform","proclaimed readjustment","regulating sharing","regulation efforts","road map","smart solutions","smart urbanization","steer china","steering approaches","strengthen control","urban governance","urbanization regulating","intelligence ai","smart city","artificial intelligence"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["article argues","platform economy","sharing economy","actors operating","ai economy","ai landscape","ai strategy","approaches rely","argues facilitated","article engages","cement central","central authority","china national","china starting","chinese ai","chinese government","city brains","city initiatives","conventional steering","country artificial","country sharing","development road","economy innovation","economy offering","economy platform","efforts contrary","emerging private","governance dilemmas","government official","innovation drive","involves number","multiple actors","national development","network coordination","new mode","offering smart","official quest","officially proclaimed","people republic","private ai","private platform","proclaimed readjustment","regulating sharing","regulation efforts","road map","smart solutions","smart urbanization","steer china","steering approaches","strengthen control","urbanization regulating","complex urban","urban governance","smart city","intelligence ai","artificial intelligence"]},{"DocId":232,"Year":2019,"Title":"An urban data framework for assessing equity in cities: Comparing accessibility to healthcare facilities in Cascadia","Abstract":"As cities continue to grow worldwide, policymakers and urban planners face the dual task of meeting rising demand for essential services while ensuring that benefits accrue to their citizens equitably. We propose a framework for assessing inclusivity and equity in cities, which leverages open data and machine learning techniques to inform urban infrastructure investment strategies. The framework is applied at a regional scale to compare differential access to healthcare facilities (public hospitals and clinics) via public transit in Vancouver, Seattle and Portland. We find important distributional impacts on vulnerable populations across the three cities. Portland displays the highest inequity in hospital and clinic access, and Vancouver the least, owing to Vancouver's relatively compact geographic area and high population density. For seniors, over 75% are socially excluded from hospitals and over 50% from clinics in Portland, compared to 30% and 3% respectively in Vancouver. In all three cities, significantly more residents of low-income neighborhoods are excluded from healthcare compared to their counterparts in high-income neighborhoods. This translates into proportionally higher transportation costs for low-income area residents compared with high-income area residents, regardless of whether they are socially excluded or not. Transportation costs are notably high for low-income seniors in Seattle and Vancouver. These findings pose a challenge for inclusive planning, since low-income and senior populations may require specialized services and are more reliant on public transportation than the average population. Our evaluation framework provides a systematic approach for municipalities to account for the distributional effects of transportation and service infrastructure planning, to integrate equity into their decision-making, and to learn from the successes and pitfalls of each other's urban policies. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["area

modeling to discover the thematic structure and spatial-temporal patterns of building renovation and adaptive reuse in cities","Abstract":"Building alteration and redevelopment play a central role in the revitalization of developed cities, where the scarcity of available land limits the construction of new buildings. The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["topic modeling","building alteration","adaptive

on South Korea: Unraveling the relationship between urban development patterns and DMSP-OLS night-time lights","Abstract":"Using artificial light data measured from satellites has the potential to change research methods in geography and urban planning. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Optical Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) night-time light datasets provided consistent and valuable data sources for investigating urbanization processes. This study intends to empirically investigate the relationship between night-time lights, population, and urban development patterns. A novel protocol was developed to integrate heterogeneous datasets into a standardized unit of analysis. Multivariate mixed-effects models were applied to detect correlations within and between provinces in South Korea. To capture physical variations of urban development, four landscape metrics were used and tested in the analyses. Diminishing returns of night-time lights to population were found in all models. In single landscape metric models, all coefficients of landscape metrics were positively related to night-time lights. In combination models, the aggregation index (AI) was no longer statistically significant. The protocol developed in this study provides an effective way to create analytical units for integrating heterogeneous forms of data. Creating standardized units of analyses will make it possible for researchers to compare their results with other studies. Landscape metrics used in this study for capturing the composition and configuration of urban development patterns will enrich the discussion in the future. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["development patterns","urban development","landscape metrics","south korea","analyses diminishing","analysis multivariate","analytical units","artificial light","capture physical","change research","combination models","create analytical","creating standardized","data creating","data measured","datasets provided","defense meteorological","detect correlations","development four","diminishing returns","effective way","empirically investigate","heterogeneous datasets","heterogeneous forms","integrate heterogeneous","integrating heterogeneous","investigating urbanization","korea unraveling","landscape metric","light data","light datasets","lights population","lights using","linescan system","longer statistically","meteorological satellite","metric models","multivariate models","novel protocol","optical linescan","patterns novel","physical variations","positively related","program optical","protocol developed","provided consistent","research methods","satellite program","single landscape","standardized unit","standardized units","statistically significant","studies landscape","study intends","system light","urbanization processes","valuable data","study provides","using artificial","data sources","four landscape","aggregation index","index ai","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban development","development patterns","landscape metrics","south korea","analyses diminishing","analysis multivariate","analytical units","artificial light","capture physical","change research","combination models","create analytical","creating standardized","data creating","data measured","datasets provided","defense meteorological","detect correlations","development four","diminishing returns","effective way","empirically investigate","heterogeneous forms","integrate heterogeneous","integrating heterogeneous","investigating urbanization","korea unraveling","landscape metric","light data","light datasets","lights population","lights using","linescan system","longer statistically","meteorological satellite","metric models","multivariate models","novel protocol","optical linescan","patterns novel","physical variations","positively related","program optical","protocol developed","provided consistent","research methods","satellite program","single landscape","standardized unit","standardized units","studies landscape","study intends","system light","urbanization processes","using artificial","valuable data","heterogeneous datasets","statistically significant","study provides","data sources","four landscape","aggregation index","index ai","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban development","development patterns","landscape metrics","south korea","analyses diminishing","analysis multivariate","analytical units","artificial light","capture physical","change research","combination models","create analytical","creating standardized","data creating","data measured","data sources","datasets provided","defense meteorological","detect correlations","development four","diminishing returns","effective way","empirically investigate","heterogeneous datasets","heterogeneous forms","integrate heterogeneous","integrating heterogeneous","investigating urbanization","korea unraveling","landscape metric","light data","light datasets","lights population","lights using","linescan system","longer statistically","meteorological satellite","metric models","multivariate models","novel protocol","optical linescan","patterns novel","physical variations","positively related","program optical","protocol developed","provided consistent","research methods","satellite program","single landscape","standardized unit","standardized units","statistically significant","studies landscape","study intends","study provides","system light","urbanization processes","using artificial","valuable data","four landscape","aggregation index","index ai","urban planning"]},{"DocId":235,"Year":2019,"Title":"Comparison of ANN Classifier to the Neuro-Fuzzy System for Collusion Detection in the Tender Procedures of Road Construction Sector","Abstract":"As the contracts in the road construction sector in Poland are usually of extremely high value and financed from the state budget, the tender procedures should not allow for the non-concurrent behaviours of tender participants. Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed. The created tool can be applied for the future tender procedures as a pre-test of a collusion appearance. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["tender procedures","road construction","collusion appearance","construction sector","fuzzy sets","high value","tender participants","artificial neural","aforementioned sets","ann classifier","bidding procedures","bids values","capabilities enriched","clients losses","collusion detection","collusion occurrence","collusion threatened","comprising hundreds","construction industry","created tool","database comprising","different level","four criteria","function values","future tender","given level","membership function","multiple output","networks predictive","occurrence probability","predictive capabilities","ranks four","results achieved","roads sections","sections bids","separate processes","sets process","sets theory","state budget","threatened contracts","two methods","two separate","utilize artificial","extremely high","network ann","neural networks","neural network","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["tender procedures","road construction","collusion appearance","construction sector","fuzzy sets","high value","tender participants","artificial neural","aforementioned sets","ann classifier","bidding procedures","bids values","capabilities enriched","clients losses","collusion detection","collusion occurrence","collusion threatened","comprising hundreds","construction industry","created tool","database comprising","different level","extremely high","four criteria","function values","future tender","given level","membership function","multiple output","network ann","networks predictive","occurrence probability","predictive capabilities","ranks four","results achieved","roads sections","sections bids","separate processes","sets process","sets theory","state budget","threatened contracts","two methods","two separate","utilize artificial","neural networks","neural network","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["tender procedures","road construction","artificial neural","collusion appearance","construction sector","fuzzy sets","high value","tender participants","aforementioned sets","ann classifier","bidding procedures","bids values","capabilities enriched","clients losses","collusion detection","collusion occurrence","collusion threatened","comprising hundreds","construction industry","created tool","database comprising","different level","extremely high","four criteria","function values","future tender","given level","membership function","multiple output","network ann","networks predictive","neural networks","occurrence probability","predictive capabilities","ranks four","results achieved","roads sections","sections bids","separate processes","sets process","sets theory","state budget","threatened contracts","two methods","two separate","utilize artificial","neural network","machine learning"]},{"DocId":236,"Year":2018,"Title":"Knowledge-based learning for solving vehicle routing problem","Abstract":"In this study, we have developed a method that applies machine learning in combination with an optimization heuristic algorithm such as a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP).

Supervised classification methods can be exploited to translate the UAV data into such basemaps. However, these methods require labeled training samples, the collection of which may be complex and time consuming. Existing spatial datasets can be exploited to provide the training labels, but these often contain errors due to differences in the date or resolution of the dataset from which these outdated labels were obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for updating basemaps using global and local contextual cues to automatically remove unreliable samples from the training set, and thereby, improve the classification accuracy. Using UAV datasets over Kigali, Rwanda, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we demonstrate how the amount of mislabeled training samples can be reduced by 44.1% and 35.5%, respectively, leading to a classification accuracy of 92.1% in Kigali and 91.3% in Dar es Salaam. To achieve the same accuracy in Dar es Salaam, between 50000 and 60000 manually labeled image segments would be needed. This demonstrates that the proposed approach of using outdated spatial data to provide labels and iteratively removing unreliable samples is a viable method for obtaining high classification accuracies while reducing the costly step of acquiring labeled training samples. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dar es","es salaam","training samples","labeled training","uav data","unreliable samples","classification accuracy","accuracy using","acquiring labeled","automatic basemap","automatically remove","basemap updating","basemaps supervised","basemaps using","consuming existing","contain errors","contextual cues","costly step","data unmanned","errors due","existing spatial","frequent intervals","image segments","intervals making","iteratively removing","kigali rwanda","labeled image","local contextual","manually labeled","methods require","mislabeled training","noisy labels","obtain aerial","obtaining high","outdated labels","outdated spatial","provide labels","remove unreliable","removing unreliable","require basemaps","require labeled","respectively leading","salaam tanzania","spatial data","spatial datasets","training labels","training set","uav datasets","updating basemaps","using global","using outdated","valuable tool","vehicles uavs","viable method","aerial vehicles","classification accuracies","high classification","using uav","aerial imagery","supervised classification","urban planners","time consuming","classification methods","unmanned aerial","proposed approach"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dar es","es salaam","training samples","labeled training","uav data","unreliable samples","classification accuracy","accuracy using","acquiring labeled","automatic basemap","automatically remove","basemap updating","basemaps supervised","basemaps using","classification accuracies","consuming existing","contain errors","contextual cues","costly step","data unmanned","errors due","existing spatial","frequent intervals","image segments","intervals making","iteratively removing","kigali rwanda","labeled image","local contextual","manually labeled","methods require","mislabeled training","noisy labels","obtain aerial","obtaining high","outdated labels","outdated spatial","provide labels","remove unreliable","removing unreliable","require basemaps","require labeled","respectively leading","salaam tanzania","spatial data","spatial datasets","training labels","training set","uav datasets","updating basemaps","using global","using outdated","using uav","valuable tool","vehicles uavs","viable method","aerial vehicles","classification methods","high classification","aerial imagery","supervised classification","time consuming","urban planners","unmanned aerial","proposed approach"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["dar es","es salaam","training samples","labeled training","uav data","unreliable samples","classification accuracy","accuracy using","acquiring labeled","aerial vehicles","automatic basemap","automatically remove","basemap updating","basemaps supervised","basemaps using","classification accuracies","classification methods","consuming existing","contain errors","contextual cues","costly step","data unmanned","errors due","existing spatial","frequent intervals","high classification","image segments","intervals making","iteratively removing","kigali rwanda","labeled image","local contextual","manually labeled","methods require","mislabeled training","noisy labels","obtain aerial","obtaining high","outdated labels","outdated spatial","proposed approach","provide labels","remove unreliable","removing unreliable","require basemaps","require labeled","respectively leading","salaam tanzania","spatial data","spatial datasets","training labels","training set","uav datasets","updating basemaps","urban planners","using global","using outdated","using uav","valuable tool","vehicles uavs","viable method","aerial imagery","supervised classification","time consuming","unmanned aerial"]},{"DocId":239,"Year":2018,"Title":"Deep CNN-based methods to evaluate neighborhood-scale urban valuation through street scenes perception","Abstract":"Social data from city level provides unprecedented opportunities to identify urban attributes from various angles.

Traffic control has been shown to be a means of maintaining road serviceability with a key input being traffic inference. The harvesting of sufficiently large data sets for traffic inference has thus far been a challenge examined by the scientific community. A modelling, interactive design approach to the harvesting and preprocessing of vehicular data can be used to bridge the gap for traffic control to be autonomously implementable in an urban context. With this consideration, this paper explores the implementation of an internet of things multiagent system, in a network and equipped with sensors, distributed along the roadway to collect and share this vehicular data among its nodes and then process the data using a machine learning algorithm for learning and subsequent inference of vehicular types. An interactive design approach is used in the creation of a reduced model of knowledge from each node\u2019s bulk harvested data, which is then easily stored or deployed and which also facilitates post-processing of data. Considering the smart city as a product, the interactive approach to product engineering permits the implementation of these mathematical models as part of an interactive traffic control system, to ensure the city\u2019s adaptability to the ever-changing needs of its inhabitants. In this paper, we present the analysis of the trivial case of the detection of presence and absence of a class A type vehicle. In the introductory section, we examine the problem of transportation in urban expansion. In section two, we examine the solution provided by the Smart Cities with respect to transport services. Further problems which appear within these transport services and their respective solutions in machine learning and the internet of things are discussed in this section on these disruptive technologies. Section three examines the bibliography for successes achieved with similar research and also demonstrates the basis for classification by support vector machines. Sections four to six explain how the experiment is set up to test the hypothesis that over 99% accuracy in vehicular detection can be achieved with the proposed system when cross-referenced with the actual acoustic, magnetic and video presence and absence of a test vehicle. \u00a9 2017, Springer-Verlag France.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["traffic control","design

In recent years, extraction of urban structures from remotely sensed images has been extensively explored. The key advantages of this imaging modality are reduction of surveying expense and time. It also elevates restrictions on ground surveys. Thus far, much research typically extracts these structures from very high resolution satellite imagery, which are unfortunately of relatively poor spectral resolution, resulting in good precision yet moderate accuracy. Therefore, this paper investigates extraction of buildings from middle and high resolution satellite images by using spectral indices (Normalized Difference Building Index: NDBI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: NDVI, Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index: SAVI, Modified Normalized Difference Index: MNDWI, and Global Environment Monitoring Index: GEMI) by means of various Machine Learning methods (Artificial Neural Network: ANN, K-Nearest Neighbor: KNN, and Support Vector Machine: SVM) and Data Fusion (i.e., Majority Voting).

In remote sensing research, the process of creating an accurate land cover map is an important subject. Recently, there has been growing research interest in the object-oriented image classification techniques. The object-oriented image classification consists of multidimensional features including object features and thus requires multi-dimensional image classification approaches. For example, a linear model such as the maximum likelihood method of pixel-based classification cannot characterize the patterns or relations of multi-dimensional data. In multi-dimensional image classification, data mining and ensemble learning have been shown to increase accuracy and flexibility. This study examined the use of the object-oriented image classification by the multiple machine learning algorithms for land cover mapping. We applied four classifiers: Classification and regression tree (CART), Decision tree with Boosting, Decision tree with Bagging, and Random Forest. The study area was Sado Island in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Pan-sharpened SPOT\/HRG imagery (June 2007) was used and classified into the following eight classes: broad-leaved deciduous forest, Japanese cedar, Japanese red pine, bamboo forest, paddy field, urban area, road, and bare land. We prepared four data sets with the object based features including textural information. The number of features is increased from data set I through IV. As the result, CART was unsuitable for multi-dimensional classification. Random Forest and Decision tree with Boosting showed high classification accuracies. Furthermore, in the data set with the limited features, Decision tree with Boosting was the accurate classifier. Finally, we propose two machine learning algorithms to every datasets. Random Forest is effective in the case of the multi-dimensional image classification such as data set II, III, and IV. Decision tree with Boosting is effective in the case of the image classification with the limited features such as data set I.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["image

development pattern significantly impacts stream water quality by influencing pollutant generation, build-up, and wash-off processes. It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3\u2212-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3\u2212-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season.

However, it changes rapidly with economic growth. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based photogrammetry works well in this situation with its advantages of quick and high-resolution data updating. In this paper, in order to improve building extraction accuracy in complex areas where buildings are characterized by various patterns, complex structures, and unique styles, we present a framework which applies deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation to UAV images with digital surface model (DSM) and visible-band difference vegetation index (VDVI). The results show that extraction accuracy improves. The combination of red, green, blue (RGB) and VDVI bands (RGBVI) can effectively distinguish the building area and vegetation. The application of RGB with DSM bands (RGBD) helps separate buildings from ground objects. The combination of RGB, DSM, and VDVI bands (RGBDVI) can identify small buildings which are usually not high and covered partly by tree branches. The proposed method is further applied to an open standard dataset to evaluate its robustness and results indicate an increased overall accuracy from RGB only (93%) to RGBD (97%). \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["extraction accuracy","uav photogrammetry","vdvi bands","semantic segmentation","building extraction","accuracy improves","applies deep","bands rgbd","bands rgbdvi","bands rgbvi","blue rgb","changes rapidly","complex areas","complex structures","covered partly","data updating","deep semantic","dl semantic","dsm bands","economic growth","effectively distinguish","essential part","gis applications","green blue","ground objects","growth unmanned","helps separate","improve building","increased overall","index vdvi","learning dl","open standard","patterns complex","photogrammetry building","photogrammetry works","present framework","red green","rgb dsm","rgbd helps","separate buildings","small buildings","standard dataset","system gis","tree branches","unique styles","various patterns","vehicles uav","aerial vehicles","building information","difference vegetation","identify small","information system","model dsm","surface model","uav images","vegetation index","building area","digital surface","geographic information","unmanned aerial","results indicate","overall accuracy","results show","proposed method","deep learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["extraction accuracy","uav photogrammetry","vdvi bands","semantic segmentation","building extraction","accuracy improves","applies deep","bands rgbd","bands rgbdvi","bands rgbvi","blue rgb","changes rapidly","complex areas","complex structures","covered partly","data updating","deep semantic","dl semantic","dsm bands","economic growth","effectively distinguish","essential part","gis applications","green blue","ground objects","growth unmanned","helps separate","improve building","increased overall","index vdvi","information system","learning dl","open standard","patterns complex","photogrammetry building","photogrammetry works","present framework","red green","rgb dsm","rgbd helps","separate buildings","small buildings","standard dataset","system gis","tree branches","uav images","unique styles","various patterns","vehicles uav","aerial vehicles","building information","difference vegetation","geographic information","identify small","model dsm","surface model","vegetation index","building area","digital surface","unmanned aerial","results indicate","overall accuracy","results show","proposed method","deep learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["extraction accuracy","uav photogrammetry","vdvi bands","semantic segmentation","building extraction","accuracy improves","aerial vehicles","applies deep","bands rgbd","bands rgbdvi","bands rgbvi","blue rgb","building information","changes rapidly","complex areas","complex structures","covered partly","data updating","deep semantic","difference vegetation","dl semantic","dsm bands","economic growth","effectively distinguish","essential part","gis applications","green blue","ground objects","growth unmanned","helps separate","improve building","increased overall","index vdvi","information system","learning dl","open standard","patterns complex","photogrammetry building","photogrammetry works","present framework","red green","rgb dsm","rgbd helps","separate buildings","small buildings","standard dataset","system gis","tree branches","uav images","unique styles","various patterns","vegetation index","vehicles uav","geographic information","identify small","model dsm","overall accuracy","surface model","unmanned aerial","building area","digital surface","results show","results indicate","proposed method","deep learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":250,"Year":2021,"Title":"A value of civic voices for smart city: A big data analysis of civic queries posed by Seoul citizens","Abstract":"Since urban problems are increasingly becoming complex and multifaceted due to the rapid urbanization, interest in the development of smart cities as an efficient solution to such problems is growing.

greenway planning: Integrating multi-sourced urban data with machine learning algorithms","Abstract":"Urban greenways have been recognized as an important strategy to improve human-scale quality in high-density built environments. Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban design","urban data","classical urban","learning algorithms","analytical approach","design theories","greenway planning","greenway suitability","key factors","suitability analysis","new urban","algorithms maoming","algorithms urban","analysis mainly","built environments","combining classical","current greenway","data including","density diversity","design dimensions","design factors","design thinking","destination accessibility","diversity design","ewing variables","factors accordingly","factors series","gis tools","greenway network","greenway networks","important strategy","improve quality","including points","information system","integrating urban","interest pois","issues failing","lbs positioning","mainly focuses","maoming city","methodological boundaries","natural issues","network generation","networks using","optimized greenway","planning integrating","planning urban","pois service","positioning data","proposes approach","regarding greenway","scale regarding","service lbs","specifically cervero","street view","system gis","take concerns","theories specifically","theories urban","urban greenway","urban greenways","using combination","variables density","view images","machine learning","geographical information","new techniques","study proposes","case study"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban design","urban data","classical urban","learning algorithms","analytical approach","design theories","greenway planning","greenway suitability","key factors","suitability analysis","new urban","machine learning","algorithms maoming","algorithms urban","analysis mainly","built environments","combining classical","current greenway","data including","density diversity","design dimensions","design factors","design thinking","destination accessibility","diversity design","ewing variables","factors accordingly","factors series","gis tools","greenway network","greenway networks","important strategy","improve quality","including points","information system","integrating urban","interest pois","issues failing","lbs positioning","mainly focuses","maoming city","methodological boundaries","natural issues","network generation","networks using","new techniques","optimized greenway","planning integrating","planning urban","pois service","positioning data","proposes approach","regarding greenway","scale regarding","service lbs","specifically cervero","street view","system gis","take concerns","theories specifically","theories urban","urban greenway","urban greenways","using combination","variables density","view images","geographical information","study proposes","case study"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban design","urban data","classical urban","learning algorithms","analytical approach","design theories","greenway planning","greenway suitability","key factors","suitability analysis","new urban","machine learning","algorithms maoming","algorithms urban","analysis mainly","built environments","case study","combining classical","current greenway","data including","density diversity","design dimensions","design factors","design thinking","destination accessibility","diversity design","ewing variables","factors accordingly","factors series","geographical information","gis tools","greenway network","greenway networks","important strategy","improve quality","including points","information system","integrating urban","interest pois","issues failing","lbs positioning","mainly focuses","maoming city","methodological boundaries","natural issues","network generation","networks using","new techniques","optimized greenway","planning integrating","planning urban","pois service","positioning data","proposes approach","regarding greenway","scale regarding","service lbs","specifically cervero","street view","study proposes","system gis","take concerns","theories specifically","theories urban","urban greenway","urban greenways","using combination","variables density","view images"]},{"DocId":253,"Year":2020,"Title":"GIS-enabled digital twin system for sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions: A case study of Jeonju city, south Korea","Abstract":"Despite the growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project\u2014in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

question of what cities can contribute to mitigation and adapting to climate change is gaining traction among researchers and policy makers alike. However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

Hence, cold-air paths are an important mitigation aspect in urban planning. The identification of cold-air paths by field measurements, however, is time-consuming and it is difficult to cover larger spatial domains (e.g. entire cities). Therefore, we used a machine learning technique, boosted regression trees (BRT), for estimating the spatial distribution of cold-air paths in three German cities (Braunschweig, Freiburg, Stuttgart). We identified the most important predictor variables for cold-air path occurrence and tested the spatial transferability of BRT models from one training city to the other study cities. Three variables explaining differences in surface elevation indicated strongest influence on spatial distribution of cold-air paths: relative surface elevation, topographic position index, and topographic wind index. We achieved predictions for the spatial distribution of cold-air paths for cities the model was trained on, resulting in model performances of 0.85 < AUC < 0.96 (AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Model transfers to other cities, however, achieved only poor to moderate results (0.5 < AUC < 0.8). The city of Freiburg tended to be the most suitable basis for a general model, since it covers the largest range of conditions. Transfer works best for \u2018similar\u2019 cities, i.e. cities with a comparable range of predictor variables and morphological structure. Cold-air path identification via BRT modelling appeared to be a promising method delivering helpful information for urban planning. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier

and height maps of urban areas serve as a valuable data source for numerous applications, such as disaster management or city planning. While this information is not globally available, it can be substituted by digital surface models (DSMs), automatically produced from inexpensive satellite imagery. However, stereo DSMs often suffer from noise and blur. Furthermore, they are heavily distorted by vegetation, which is of lesser relevance for most applications. Such basic models can be filtered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on labels derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and 3D city models, in order to obtain a refined DSM. We propose a modular multi-task learning concept that consolidates existing approaches into a generalized framework. Our encoder-decoder models with shared encoders and multiple task-specific decoders leverage roof type classification as a secondary task and multiple objectives including a conditional adversarial term. The contributing single-objective losses are automatically weighted in the final multi-task loss function based on learned uncertainty estimates. We evaluated the performance of specific instances of this family of network architectures. Our method consistently outperforms the state of the art on common data, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and generalizes well to a new dataset of an independent study area. \u00a9 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Land-use distribution is one of the key factors affecting air quality, and research on the impact of land-use distribution on air pollution has drawn wide attention. However, considerable studies have mostly used linear regression models, which fail to capture the nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns) and to show how impacts on PM2.5 vary with land-use magnitudes. In addition, related studies have generally focused on annual analyses, ignoring the seasonal variability of the impact of land-use distribution on PM2.5, thus leading to possible estimation biases for PM2.5 . This study was designed to address these issues and assess the impacts of land-use distribution on PM2.5 in Weifang, China. A machine learning statistical model, the boosted regression tree (BRT), was applied to measure nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5, capture how land-use magnitude impacts PM2.5 across different seasons, and explore the policy implications for urban planning. The main conclusions are that the air quality will significantly improve with an increase in grassland and forest area, especially below 8% and 20%, respectively. When the distribution of construction land is greater than around 10%, the PM2.5 pollution can be seriously substantially increased with the increment of their areas. The impact of gardens and farmland presents seasonal characteristics. It is noted that as the weather becomes colder, the inhibitory effect of vegetation distribution on the PM2.5 concentration gradually decreases, while the positive impacts of artificial surface distributions, such as construction land and roads, are aggravated because leaves drop off in autumn (September\u2013November) and winter (December\u2013February). According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that Weifang should strengthen pollution control in winter, for instance, expand the coverage areas of evergreen vegetation like Pinus bungeana Zucc. and Euonymus japonicus Thunb, and increase the width and numbers of branches connecting different main roads. The findings also provide quantitative and optimal land-use planning and strategies to minimize PM2.5 pollution, referring to the status of regional urbanization and greening construction. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Using a New Similarity Measure Based on Smart Card Data","Abstract":"Identifying the structure of cities has long been studied in urban planning and traffic modeling. This study presents a reliable method that reveals the structure of cities mainly based on clustering analysis using a new similarity measure. Several previous studies have used well-known clustering algorithms in machine learning fields, such as k-means clustering based on temporal mobility patterns of regions, whereas other studies have applied community detection algorithms on networks that depict traffic flows. However, the former does not reflect spatial interactions among places or areas, and the latter groups' places or areas with different land uses into the same cluster. To address these issues in existing approaches, this study proposes a new similarity method that considers not only temporal mobility patterns of areas but also spatial interactions with other areas. Moreover, the study combines spectral clustering repeated several times with hierarchical clustering to obtain a reliable structure that keeps the contiguity of clusters and determine the hierarchy of different areal units. The application of the proposed method to the data for Seoul, South Korea, reveals that the proposed clustering process divides a city into relatively homogeneous areas in terms of land uses. The flow maps based on the clustering results also revealed the spatial interactions between different areas and identify the polycentric structure of Seoul. \u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["new similarity","spatial interactions","mobility patterns","similarity measure","temporal mobility","using new","land uses","applied community","card data","cities mainly","clustering algorithms","clustering analysis","clustering repeated","clustering using","combines spectral","community detection","data identifying","depict traffic","detection algorithms","different areal","different areas","different land","divides city","existing approaches","flow maps","groups places","homogeneous areas","korea reveals","learning fields","mainly based","maps based","measure based","obtain reliable","polycentric structure","presents reliable","process divides","proposed clustering","proposes new","reflect spatial","relatively homogeneous","reliable method","reliable structure","seoul south","similarity method","smart card","south korea","spectral clustering","study combines","study presents","traffic flows","traffic modeling","analysis using","areal units","clustering based","clustering process","clustering results","previous studies","study proposes","hierarchical clustering","proposed method","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["new similarity","spatial interactions","land uses","mobility patterns","similarity measure","temporal mobility","using new","analysis using","applied community","areal units","card data","cities mainly","clustering algorithms","clustering analysis","clustering based","clustering repeated","clustering using","combines spectral","community detection","data identifying","depict traffic","detection algorithms","different areal","different areas","different land","divides city","existing approaches","flow maps","groups places","homogeneous areas","korea reveals","learning fields","mainly based","maps based","measure based","obtain reliable","polycentric structure","presents reliable","process divides","proposed clustering","proposed method","proposes new","reflect spatial","relatively homogeneous","reliable method","reliable structure","seoul south","similarity method","smart card","south korea","spectral clustering","study combines","study presents","study proposes","traffic flows","traffic modeling","clustering process","clustering results","hierarchical clustering","previous studies","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["new similarity","spatial interactions","land uses","mobility patterns","similarity measure","temporal mobility","using new","analysis using","applied community","areal units","card data","cities mainly","clustering algorithms","clustering analysis","clustering based","clustering repeated","clustering using","combines spectral","community detection","data identifying","depict traffic","detection algorithms","different areal","different areas","different land","divides city","existing approaches","flow maps","groups places","homogeneous areas","korea reveals","learning fields","mainly based","maps based","measure based","obtain reliable","polycentric structure","presents reliable","previous studies","process divides","proposed clustering","proposed method","proposes new","reflect spatial","relatively homogeneous","reliable method","reliable structure","seoul south","similarity method","smart card","south korea","spectral clustering","study combines","study presents","study proposes","traffic flows","traffic modeling","clustering process","clustering results","hierarchical clustering","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":259,"Year":2020,"Title":"Machine Learning Assisted Urban Filling","Abstract":"When drawing urban scale plans, designers should always define the position and the shape of each building. This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks.

We propose to examine complex public transit travel patterns over a large-scale transit network, which is challenging since it involves thousands of transit passengers and massive data from heterogeneous sources. Additionally, efficient representation and visualization of discovered travel patterns is difficult given a large number of transit trips. To address these challenges, this study leverages advanced machine learning methods to identify time-varying mobility patterns based on smart card data and other urban data. The proposed approach delivers a comprehensive solution to pre-process, analyze, and visualize complex public transit travel patterns. This approach first fuses smart card data with other urban data to reconstruct original transit trips.We use two machine learning methods, including a clustering algorithm to extract transit corridors to represent primarymobility connections between different regions and a graph-embedding algorithmto discover hierarchical mobility community structures.We also devise compact and effective multi-scale visualization forms to represent the discovered travel behavior dynamics. An interactive web-based mapping prototype is developed to integrate advanced machine learning methods with specific visualizations to characterize transit travel behavior patterns and to enable visual exploration of transit mobility patterns at different scales and resolutions over space and time. The proposed approach is evaluated using multi-source big transit data (e.g., smart card data, transit network data, and bus trajectory data) collected in Shenzhen City, China.

industry, it is imperative to maintain safety in relation to the complexities of the substantial railway stations. Thus, it is important to take note of the time where investments in new technologies directed at the safety of the railway enable safety and protection in this area. Novel technological techniques such as big data analysis (BDA), data mining or machine learning (ML) have been developed and applied in many areas such as sales, banking and healthcare. The development of such methods has important benefits within the context of railway safety, however, these new methods need to be implemented and developed with consideration of whether these operational models can help to solve the various difficulties that currently exist in the risk analysis of railway stations. Moreover, as the adoption of the Internet of thing (IoT) grows, it is expected that analytical needs for handling data will also increase. It has been shown that the progression towards automation and applying such innovative new technologies such as BDA may be a powerful tool for integration in the future of transportation in general and the railway industry in particular, whereby analytical predictions can aid in the development of safer railway stations which have greater potential for ensuring the safety of passengers. In this paper a Bow Tie (BT) framework model has been created to combine BDA into the risk assessment process. The BDA can be beneficial to the risk assessment, support the decision makers in real time, and reduce human errors. This method can be fully integrated into passenger data and the business model for the railway station. Employing the existing safety records utilizing BDA is expected to mitigate risks, predict hazards, raise safety and security efficiency and reduce the cost. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["railway stations","railway industry","risk assessment","new technologies","big data","analysis bda","analytical needs","analytical predictions","area novel","assessment process","assessment support","bda data","bow tie","bt framework","business model","combine bda","currently exist","decision makers","enable safety","enhancing passenger","existing safety","framework model","fully integrated","greater potential","handling data","hazards raise","human errors","important benefits","increasing demand","innovative new","iot grows","learning ml","maintain safety","mitigate risks","new methods","novel technological","operational models","paper bow","passenger data","passenger safety","powerful tool","predict hazards","railway enable","railway safety","railway station","raise safety","records utilizing","reduce human","risk analysis","risks predict","safer railway","safety records","sales banking","security efficiency","station employing","substantial railway","take note","technological techniques","technologies directed","thing iot","tie bt","utilizing bda","utilizing big","various difficulties","data analysis","data mining","real time","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["railway stations","railway industry","risk assessment","big data","new technologies","analysis bda","analytical needs","analytical predictions","area novel","assessment process","assessment support","bda data","bow tie","bt framework","business model","combine bda","currently exist","data analysis","data mining","decision makers","enable safety","enhancing passenger","existing safety","framework model","fully integrated","greater potential","handling data","hazards raise","human errors","important benefits","increasing demand","innovative new","iot grows","learning ml","maintain safety","mitigate risks","new methods","novel technological","operational models","paper bow","passenger data","passenger safety","powerful tool","predict hazards","railway enable","railway safety","railway station","raise safety","real time","records utilizing","reduce human","risk analysis","risks predict","safer railway","safety records","sales banking","security efficiency","station employing","substantial railway","take note","technological techniques","technologies directed","thing iot","tie bt","utilizing bda","utilizing big","various difficulties","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["railway stations","railway industry","risk assessment","big data","new technologies","analysis bda","analytical needs","analytical predictions","area novel","assessment process","assessment support","bda data","bow tie","bt framework","business model","combine bda","currently exist","data analysis","data mining","decision makers","enable safety","enhancing passenger","existing safety","framework model","fully integrated","greater potential","handling data","hazards raise","human errors","important benefits","increasing demand","innovative new","iot grows","learning ml","maintain safety","mitigate risks","new methods","novel technological","operational models","paper bow","passenger data","passenger safety","powerful tool","predict hazards","railway enable","railway safety","railway station","raise safety","real time","records utilizing","reduce human","risk analysis","risks predict","safer railway","safety records","sales banking","security efficiency","station employing","substantial railway","take note","technological techniques","technologies directed","thing iot","tie bt","utilizing bda","utilizing big","various difficulties","machine learning"]},{"DocId":262,"Year":2019,"Title":"Enhanced urban clustering in VANETs using online machine learning","Abstract":"Clustering in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) is essential to mitigate different challenges and meet the required quality of communications.

This approach exploits Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) to predict the behavior of the vehicles near an intersection and adapt the clusters accordingly. The main advantage of the developed OS-ELM prediction model is its ability to continuously learn and update in real time.

Identifying the location and living conditions of slums is a critical step toward designing effective urban policies. By combining household survey data and census data with high spatial resolution satellite imagery and other geospatial data using multiple methodologies, including machine learning, we attempt to define slums quantitatively within the city of Accra. Within these defined slum areas, the patterns of monetary poverty are assessed. Poverty rates are estimated at the neighborhood level and indicate that living in slums is strongly correlated with higher monetary poverty. Poverty is more prevalent in communities in areas of lower elevation, which in Accra are generally flood-prone areas. However, the results also suggest that not all people living in slums are living in monetary poverty.

Consumers of self-driving cars and vehicles have different concerns, for example, safety and security, to name a few. Also, the public sector has interests in self-driving cars such as amending policies to enable the management of self-driving vehicles in cities, urban planning, traffic management and, etc. In this paper, more than 2700 corpus are extracted from literature from several subject areas to identify latent (hidden) topics of self-driving cars. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used for topic identification. The result of this study shows that topics identified are valid research areas such as urban planning, driver car (computer) interaction, self-driving control and system design, ethics in self-driving cars, safety and risk assessment, training dataset quality and machine learning in self-driving cars are among the topics identified. Furthermore, the network visualization of association graph of terms shows that the most frequently discussed concepts reveal that control of self-driving cars is based on algorithms, data, design, method, and model. The methods used in this study and the results can be used as decision tools, if carefully applied, in diverse disciplines that are disrupted by the introduction of self-driving cars.

This paper proposes a novel utility model for structural health monitoring that would enable early detection of risk factors and mitigation of loss. The proposed utility computing model takes the input data in terms of 'number of occupants' in a building (i.e. MAC, International Mobile Equipment Identifier addresses and biometric attendance system installed) and SHM system data (i.e. sensors readings). It give visual representation of all the data for utility managers and experts to decide better location of SHM and number of SHM needed per zone depending on high disturbances created due to higher occupancy and number of structures per zone. Denser area with higher structures and higher population will require more precise and accurate SHM systems compared to rural areas. It also analyzes the data from SHM system and using simple machine learning algorithm give experts' suggestions for type of SHM needed at an area. It make it possible for the data of each and every device of SHM systems over several zones to be accessible by specific authorities that can be used to predict as well as forecast any natural disaster. The Structural Health Monitoring utility model is unique in terms of its heterogeneity of resource management in realizing the utility processes. Finally, a case study of Qatar University is looked at where nodes are distributed in zones along with occupant measuring is used over each building. The data was taken over simulated occupation models and mathematical models from literature for occupation and zone calculation using ideal SHM system data. It can be inferred from the data that real-time analysis data will act similar to simulated and proposed Utility Computing System will give visual data and analyze the zones as can be seen in the results.

if we can estimate the location of each user equipment (UE) with high accuracy, efficient cell planning and network optimization become possible. However, it is difficult for operators to estimate the location of most commercial UEs because they cannot feedback their location information directly to their serving base stations with the exception of UEs with Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) functions specified in LTE Release 10. Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprint method is known as an effective localization method, with which we can estimate the location of UEs with only RF signature and location information beforehand. In LTE, RF fingerprint database can be collected by conducting drive tests or using measurement data from UEs compatible with MDT. Although the estimation accuracy can be better with more RF signatures, the increase in the amount of RF signatures causes the increase in the feedback, which consumes the uplink capacity and UE battery. Furthermore, keeping all RF signatures in database is inefficient because some RF signatures do not have effect on improving estimation accuracy. Hence, it is important to clarify the effect of each RF signature and use only effective ones in the localization. In this paper, we conducted a field experiment to create an RF fingerprint database in dense urban area, and evaluated the effectiveness of each RF signature by making several localization models based on machine learning. Eventually, we clarified minimum RF signatures required to operate RF fingerprint localization in LTE network. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["rf signatures","rf fingerprint","rf signature","estimation accuracy","field experiment","fingerprint database","lte network","location information","accuracy efficient","become possible","cell planning","clarified minimum","commercial ues","communications networks","conducted field","conducting drive","dense urban","drive test","drive tests","effective localization","effective ones","efficient cell","equipment ue","fingerprint localization","fingerprint method","frequency rf","functions specified","high accuracy","improving estimation","information directly","learning eventually","localization method","localization models","lte release","lte rf","mdt functions","minimum rf","mobile communications","models based","network optimization","operate rf","optimization become","radio frequency","release radio","serving base","signatures causes","signatures required","test mdt","ue battery","ues compatible","uplink capacity","user equipment","using measurement","base stations","localization based","measurement data","urban area","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["rf signatures","rf fingerprint","rf signature","estimation accuracy","field experiment","fingerprint database","location information","lte network","accuracy efficient","base stations","become possible","cell planning","clarified minimum","commercial ues","communications networks","conducted field","conducting drive","dense urban","drive test","drive tests","effective localization","effective ones","efficient cell","equipment ue","fingerprint localization","fingerprint method","frequency rf","functions specified","high accuracy","improving estimation","information directly","learning eventually","localization method","localization models","lte release","lte rf","mdt functions","minimum rf","mobile communications","models based","network optimization","operate rf","optimization become","radio frequency","release radio","serving base","signatures causes","signatures required","test mdt","ue battery","ues compatible","uplink capacity","urban area","user equipment","using measurement","machine learning","localization based","measurement data"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["rf signatures","rf fingerprint","rf signature","estimation accuracy","field experiment","fingerprint database","location information","lte network","accuracy efficient","base stations","become possible","cell planning","clarified minimum","commercial ues","communications networks","conducted field","conducting drive","dense urban","drive test","drive tests","effective localization","effective ones","efficient cell","equipment ue","fingerprint localization","fingerprint method","frequency rf","functions specified","high accuracy","improving estimation","information directly","learning eventually","localization method","localization models","lte release","lte rf","mdt functions","minimum rf","mobile communications","models based","network optimization","operate rf","optimization become","radio frequency","release radio","serving base","signatures causes","signatures required","test mdt","ue battery","ues compatible","uplink capacity","urban area","user equipment","using measurement","machine learning","localization based","measurement data"]},{"DocId":268,"Year":2017,"Title":"Humans as avatars in smart and playable cities","Abstract":"We compare the behavior of avatars in videogames with the expected behavior of humans in smart environments, particularly smart urban environments.

One out of several ways to help meet these challenges is in the intelligent routing of road traffic through congested urban areas. Our goal is to show the feasibility of using automated planning to perform this routing, taking into account a knowledge of vehicle types, vehicle emissions, route maps, air quality zones, etc. Specifically focusing on air quality concerns, in this paper we investigate the problem where the goals are to minimise overall vehicle delay while utilising network capacity fully, and respecting air quality limits. We introduce an automated planning approach for the routing of traffic to address these areas. The approach has been evaluated on micro-simulation models that use real-world data supplied by our industrial partner.

Given urban population growth, and that the amount of waste generated by each of us citizens is also growing, the total amount of waste to be collected and treated is growing dramatically (EPA 2011), becoming one sensitive issue for local governments. A modern technique for waste collection that is steadily being adopted is automated vacuum waste collection. This technology uses air suction on a closed network of underground pipes to move waste from the collection points to the processing station, reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as inconveniences to citizens (odors, noise,...) and allowing better waste reuse and recycling. This technique is open to optimize energy consumption because moving huge amounts of waste by air impulsion requires a lot of electric power. The described problem challenge here is, precisely, that of organizing and scheduling waste collection to minimize the amount of energy per ton of collected waste in such a system via the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques. This kind of problems are an inviting opportunity to showcase the possibilities that AI for Computational Sustainability offers.

This conventional approach has been recently challenged by the rapid ICT development which added a lively, virtual, non-spatial dimension of urban economy. The well-established foundations of urban planning started to shake, calling for a new paradigm.

However, built environments attenuate GPS signals by reflecting or blocking them resulting in some cases multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These effects cause range errors that degrade GPS positioning accuracy. Enhancements in the design of antennae and receivers deliver a level of reduction of multipath. However, NLOS signal reception and residual effects of multipath are still to be mitigated sufficiently for improvements in range errors and positioning accuracy. Recent machine learning-based methods have shown promise in improving pseudorange-based position solutions by considering multiple variables from raw GPS measurements. However, positioning accuracy is limited by low accuracy signal reception classification. Unlike the existing methods, which use machine learning to directly predict the signal reception classification, we use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based method to predict the pseudorange errors by considering the signal strength, satellite elevation angle and pseudorange residuals. With the predicted pseudorange errors, two variations of the algorithm are proposed to improve positioning accuracy. The first corrects pseudorange errors and the other either corrects or excludes the signals determined to contain the effects of multipath and NLOS signals. The results for a challenging urban environment characterized by high-rise buildings on one side, show that the 3-D positioning accuracy of the pseudorange error correction-based positioning measured in terms of the root mean square error is 23.3 m, an improvement of more than 70% over the conventional methods. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["positioning

In the field of urban planning, it is pertinent to understand both how such techniques can advance our understanding of cities, and how they can be embedded within transparent and effective digital planning tools, known as planning support systems. This research specifically focuses on two related contributions. First, it investigates the role of planning support systems in supporting a participatory data analytics approach through an iterative process of developing and evaluating a planning support system environment. Second, it investigates how specifically machine learning planning support systems can be co-designed by built environment practitioners and stakeholders in this environment to solve a real planning issue in Sydney, Australia. This paper presents the results of applied research undertaken through the design and implementation of four workshops, involving 57 participants who were involved in a co-design process. The research follows a mixed-methods approach, studying a wide array of measures related to participatory analytics, task load, perceived added value, recordings and observations. The results highlight recommendations regarding the design and evaluation of planning support system environments for co-design and their coupling with machine learning techniques. It was found that consistency and transparency are highly valued and central to the design of a planning support system in this context. General attitudes towards machine learning and artificial intelligence as techniques for planners and developers were positive, as they were seen as both potentially transformative but also as simply another technique to assist with workflows. Some conceptual challenges were encountered driven by practitioners' simultaneous need for concrete scenarios for accurate predictions, paired with a desire for predictions to drive the development of these scenarios. Insights from this work can inform future planning support system evaluation and co-design studies, in particular those aiming to support democracy enhancement, greater inclusion and more efficient resource allocation through a participatory analytics approach. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["planning support","support system","support

The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban areas","diverse range","aerial vehicles","unmanned aerial","accuracy based","advanced ai","advanced

of Tehran","Abstract":"Purpose: This research aims to introduce a new methodology for integration between urban design strategies and supervised machine learning (SML) method \u2013 by applying both energy engineering modeling (evaluating phase) for the existing green sidewalks and statistical energy modeling (predicting phase) for the new ones \u2013 to offer algorithms that help to catch the optimum morphology of green sidewalks, in case of high quality of the outdoor thermal comfort and less errors in results. Design\/methodology\/approach: The tools of the study are the way of processing by SML, predicting the future based on the past. Machine learning is benefited from Python advantages. The structure of the study consisted of two main parts, as the majority of the similar studies follow: engineering energy modeling and statistical energy modeling. According to the concept of the study, at first, from 2268 models, some are randomly selected, simulated and sensitively analyzed by ENVI-met. Furthermore, the Envi-met output as the quantity of thermal comfort \u2013 predicted mean vote (PMV) and weather items are inputs of Python. Then, the formed data set is processed by SML, to reach the final reliable predicted output. Findings: The process of SML leads the study to find thermal comfort of current models and other similar sidewalks. The results are evaluated by both PMV mathematical model and SML error evaluation functions. The results confirm that the average of the occurred error is about 1%. Then the method of study is reliable to apply in the variety of similar fields. Finding of this study can be helpful in perspective of the sustainable architecture strategies in the buildings and urban scales, to determine, monitor and control energy-based behaviors (thermal comfort, heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation) in operational phase of the systems (existed elements in buildings, and constructions) and the planning and designing phase of the future built cases \u2013 all over their life spans. Research limitations\/implications: Limitations of the study are related to the study variables and alternatives that are notable impact on the findings. Furthermore, the most trustable input data will result in the more accuracy in output. Then modeling and simulation processes are most significant part of the research to reach the exact results in the final step. Practical implications: Finding of the study can be helpful in urban design strategies. By finding outdoor thermal comfort that resulted from machine learning method, urban and landscape designers, policymakers and architects are able to estimate the features of their designs in air quality and urban health and can be sure in catching design goals in case of thermal comfort in urban atmosphere. Social implications: By 2030, cities are delved as living spaces for about three out of five people. As green infrastructures influence in moderating the cities\u2019 climate, the relationship between green spaces and habitants\u2019 thermal comfort is deduced. Although the strategies to outside thermal comfort improvement, by design methods and applicants, are not new subject to discuss, applying machines that may be common in predicting results can be called as a new insight in applying more effective design strategies and in urban environment\u2019s comfort preparation. Then study\u2019s footprint in social implications stems in learning from the previous projects and developing more efficient strategies to prepare cities as the more comfortable and healthy places to live, with the more efficient models and consuming money and time. Originality\/value: The study achievements are expected to be applied not only in Tehran but also in other climate zones as the pattern in more eco-city design strategies. Although some similar studies are done in different majors, the concept of study is new vision in urban studies. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing

reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. \u00a9 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

Brain-Inspired Cognitive Computing","Abstract":"In recent years, the urbanization process has brought modernity while also causing key issues, such as traffic congestion and parking conflicts. Therefore, cities need a more intelligent \"brain\" to form more intelligent and efficient transportation systems. At present, as a type of machine learning, the traditional clustering algorithm still has limitations. K-means algorithm is widely used to solve traffic clustering problems, but it has limitations, such as sensitivity to initial points and poor robustness. Therefore, based on the hybrid architecture of Quantum Annealing (QA) and brain-inspired cognitive computing, this study proposes QA and Brain-Inspired Clustering Algorithm (QABICA) to solve the problem of urban taxi-stand locations. Based on the traffic trajectory data of Xi'an and Chengdu provided by Didi Chuxing, the clustering results of our algorithm and K-means algorithm are compared. We find that the average taxi-stand location bias of the final result based on QABICA is smaller than that based on K-means, and the bias of our algorithm can effectively reduce the tradition K-means bias by approximately 42%, up to approximately 83%, with higher robustness. QA algorithm is able to jump out of the local suboptimal solutions and approach the global optimum, and brain-inspired cognitive computing provides search feedback and direction. Thus, we will further consider applying our algorithm to analyze urban traffic flow, and solve traffic congestion and other key problems in intelligent transportation. \u00a9 2020 Tsinghua University Press.

The simulation takes into account an urban environment for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) propagation condition.

Among the examined algorithms, KNN shows the best performance, thus being an appealing option to predict path loss in urban areas.

As a long-lasting challenging problem in both machine learning and geoinformatics communities, many approaches have been proposed to tackle it. However, previous methods always overlook the abundant information embedded in the HSR remote sensing images. The effectiveness of these methods, e.g., accuracy of detection, is therefore limited to some extent. To overcome the mentioned challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel two-phase deep framework, dubbed GLGOD-Net, to effectively detect meaningful objects in HSR images. GLGOD-Net firstly attempts to learn the enhanced deep representations from super-resolution image data. Fully utilizing the augmented image representations, GLGOD-Net then learns the fused representations into which both local and global latent features are implanted. Such fused representations learned by GLGOD-Net can be used to precisely detect different objects in remote sensing images. The proposed framework has been extensively tested on a real-world HSR image dataset for object detection and has been compared with several strong baselines. The remarkable experimental results validate the effectiveness of GLGOD-Net. The success of GLGOD-Net not only advances the cutting-edge of image data analytics, but also promotes the corresponding applicability of deep learning in remote sensing imagery. \u00a9 2020","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["object detection","fused representations","image data","sensing imagery","remote sensing","sensing images","abundant information","adversarially augmented","augmented feature","augmented image","civil infrastructure","construction disaster","corresponding applicability","data analytics","data fully","deep framework","detect different","detect meaningful","different objects","disaster rescuing","enhanced deep","extensively tested","feature fusion","firstly attempts","framework dubbed","fully utilizing","fusion object","geoinformatics communities","global latent","hsr image","hsr images","hsr plays","hsr remote","image representations","image retrieval","images firstly","information embedded","infrastructure construction","latent features","meaningful objects","mentioned challenge","methods accuracy","novel deep","planning civil","plays significant","precise object","precisely detect","previous methods","remarkable experimental","representations learned","resolutions hsr","results validate","scenarios environment","significant role","spatial resolutions","strong baselines","using adversarially","challenging problem","deep representations","effectively detect","geographic image","high spatial","image dataset","detection using","monitoring urban","environment monitoring","propose novel","proposed framework","experimental results","deep learning","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["object detection","fused representations","image data","sensing imagery","remote sensing","sensing images","abundant information","adversarially augmented","augmented feature","augmented image","civil infrastructure","construction disaster","corresponding applicability","data analytics","data fully","deep framework","detect different","detect meaningful","different objects","disaster rescuing","enhanced deep","extensively tested","feature fusion","firstly attempts","framework dubbed","fully utilizing","fusion object","geographic image","geoinformatics communities","global latent","hsr image","hsr images","hsr plays","hsr remote","image representations","image retrieval","images firstly","information embedded","infrastructure construction","latent features","meaningful objects","mentioned challenge","methods accuracy","novel deep","planning civil","plays significant","precise object","precisely detect","previous methods","remarkable experimental","representations learned","resolutions hsr","results validate","scenarios environment","significant role","spatial resolutions","strong baselines","using adversarially","challenging problem","deep representations","effectively detect","high spatial","image dataset","detection using","monitoring urban","environment monitoring","propose novel","proposed framework","experimental results","deep learning","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["object detection","fused representations","sensing imagery","image data","remote sensing","sensing images","abundant information","adversarially augmented","augmented feature","augmented image","challenging problem","civil infrastructure","construction disaster","corresponding applicability","data analytics","data fully","deep framework","deep representations","detect different","detect meaningful","different objects","disaster rescuing","effectively detect","enhanced deep","extensively tested","feature fusion","firstly attempts","framework dubbed","fully utilizing","fusion object","geographic image","geoinformatics communities","global latent","high spatial","hsr image","hsr images","hsr plays","hsr remote","image representations","image retrieval","images firstly","information embedded","infrastructure construction","latent features","meaningful objects","mentioned challenge","methods accuracy","novel deep","planning civil","plays significant","precise object","precisely detect","previous methods","remarkable experimental","representations learned","resolutions hsr","results validate","scenarios environment","significant role","spatial resolutions","strong baselines","using adversarially","detection using","image dataset","monitoring urban","proposed framework","environment monitoring","propose novel","experimental results","machine learning","deep learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":293,"Year":2020,"Title":"Design of machine learning model for Urban planning and management improvement","Abstract":"With the aid of artificial intelligence, this paper builds a machine learning model with the KNN algorithm to optimize the traditional method of urban planning and management (UPM). The optimization is realized through two steps. First, the relevant theories of the updated UPM of livelihood oriented UPM (LOUPM) are explored for the later machine learning architecture design. People's livelihood has a great influence on UPM. Livelihood orientation makes the complex UPM even more complicated due to diverse living needs of citizens. This paper analyzes the deeper relationship between the people's livelihood and UPM, systematically studies the function and connotation of the people's livelihood behavior, and profoundly discusses current contradictions and restraining factors. Second, based on a better understanding of LOUPM, this paper further proposes an artificial intelligence approach to select most related factors to optimize UPM from databases. In the first paper of this series, in the analysis of the relevant UPM theories, three scopes of LOUPM are concluded to be the evaluation of data sets: authority, time, and space. Then, this paper continues to design a software model with the KNN algorithm to evaluate the urban plans and generates optimization advice for the user.

In this paper, we introduce a goal-reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can assist with these tasks by combining traditional scenario planning, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) with a novel goal-oriented Monte Carlo tree search (G-MCTS) method. G-MCTS conducts goal-oriented searches to meet the needs of heterogeneous goals and provide the best land use solutions. We evaluated this method on a real-world planning case, and the results show that 1) the goal-reasoning AI agent is good at performing complex goal reasoning tasks with many heterogeneous expert knowledge; 2) different human planning manuscripts could be integrated into a better solution via a goal-reasoning AI agent; and 3) the goal-reasoning AI agent has the potential to make comprehensive decisions during a democratic political agenda. We conclude that the goal-reasoning AI agent, via an improved reinforcement learning (RL) method of G-MCTS, provides vast potential for assisting in subjective-objective combined urban land use planning and many other similar fields by weighing heterogeneous goals, reproducing human inspiration, and acting as a reflexive sociotechnical system. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ai agent","land use","use planning","urban land","democratic urban","expert knowledge","heterogeneous expert","heterogeneous goals","accomplished mainly","best land","better solution","carlo tree","combined efforts","combined urban","combining traditional","complex goal","comprehensive decisions","conducts searches","considerable time","deep human","democratic political","different human","goal reasoning","goals reproducing","human inspiration","human planning","human thought","improved reinforcement","intelligence agent","introduce artificial","knowledge different","knowledge scenarios","learning rl","make comprehensive","method conducts","monte carlo","multicriteria decision","novel monte","performing complex","planning case","planning manuscripts","planning multicriteria","political agenda","provides vast","reasoning tasks","reflexive sociotechnical","reproducing human","require considerable","results show","rl method","scenario planning","search method","similar fields","sociotechnical system","systematizing heterogeneous","traditional scenario","tree search","use solutions","vast potential","weighing heterogeneous","reinforcement learning","artificial intelligence","analysis mcda","decision analysis","intelligence ai"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ai agent","land use","use planning","urban land","democratic urban","expert knowledge","heterogeneous expert","heterogeneous goals","accomplished mainly","analysis mcda","best land","better solution","carlo tree","combined efforts","combined urban","combining traditional","complex goal","comprehensive decisions","conducts searches","considerable time","decision analysis","deep human","democratic political","different human","goal reasoning","goals reproducing","human inspiration","human planning","human thought","improved reinforcement","intelligence agent","introduce artificial","knowledge different","knowledge scenarios","learning rl","make comprehensive","method conducts","monte carlo","multicriteria decision","novel monte","planning case","planning manuscripts","planning multicriteria","political agenda","provides vast","reasoning tasks","reflexive sociotechnical","reproducing human","require considerable","results show","rl method","scenario planning","search method","similar fields","sociotechnical system","systematizing heterogeneous","traditional scenario","tree search","use solutions","vast potential","weighing heterogeneous","artificial intelligence","performing complex","reinforcement learning","intelligence ai"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ai agent","land use","use planning","urban land","democratic urban","expert knowledge","heterogeneous expert","heterogeneous goals","accomplished mainly","analysis mcda","best land","better solution","carlo tree","combined efforts","combined urban","combining traditional","complex goal","comprehensive decisions","conducts searches","considerable time","decision analysis","deep human","democratic political","different human","goal reasoning","goals reproducing","human inspiration","human planning","human thought","improved reinforcement","intelligence agent","introduce artificial","knowledge different","knowledge scenarios","learning rl","make comprehensive","method conducts","monte carlo","multicriteria decision","novel monte","planning case","planning manuscripts","planning multicriteria","political agenda","provides vast","reasoning tasks","reflexive sociotechnical","reinforcement learning","reproducing human","require considerable","results show","rl method","scenario planning","search method","similar fields","sociotechnical system","systematizing heterogeneous","traditional scenario","tree search","use solutions","vast potential","weighing heterogeneous","artificial intelligence","performing complex","intelligence ai"]},{"DocId":295,"Year":2020,"Title":"Crosstown traffic - supervised prediction of impact of planned special events on urban traffic","Abstract":"Large-scale planned special events in cities including concerts, football games and fairs can significantly impact urban mobility.

However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geocontextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. To enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation, a multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions, forcing the embeddings to encapsulate effective representation for flow prediction. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows.

This study proposed a framework to delineate and analyze mixed land-use patterns and their evolution using municipal water consumption data. A two-step classification strategy was designed based on the rotation forest scheme to differentiate the socioeconomic types of customers (e.g., residence, commerce, public facility, manufacturing, and recreation) using multiple features extracted from the various forms of water consumption time series. The spatial distributions of the socioeconomic functions were then derived, and the mixed land use was measured using a diversity index based on information entropy. Such an approach was applied to Changshu, a typical developing county-level city in China, for the period 2004 to 2013. The results showed that the urbanization of Changshu experienced both spatial expansion and intensification, with a slightly declining rate of growth in recent years. Apart from the city center, two subcenters have emerged for industrial development. The degree of land-use mixture has increased with urban growth, indicating a maturing of urbanization. This study explored the approach of identifying individual socioeconomic functions by the consumption patterns of municipal services and demonstrated that municipal service data sets can reveal land-use patterns and dynamics at a fine spatial resolution to evaluate urban planning and management, with the advantages of large population coverage and long-term temporal lengths. \u00a9 2020,

and flexibility when compared with, more rigid, public transportation modes. However, in big cities taxi service is still unbalanced, resulting in inefficiencies such as long waiting times and excessive vacant trips. This paper presents an exploratory taxi fleet service analysis and compares two forecast models aimed at predicting the spatiotemporal variation of short-term taxi demand. For this paper, we used a large sample with more than 1 million trips between 2014 and 2017, representing roughly 10% of Lisbon's fleet. We analysed the spatiotemporal variation between pick-up and drop-off locations and how they are affected by weather conditions and points of interest. More, based on historic data, we built two models to predict the demand, ARIMA and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and evaluated and compared the performance of both models. This study not only allows the direct comparison of a linear statistical model with a machine learning one, but also leads to a better comprehension of complex interactions surrounding different urban data sources using the taxi service as a probe to better understand urban mobility-on-demand and its needs. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

In effect, more efficient traffic represents a more efficient economy. Solving the issue of congestion by increasing the number of roads is not always the most cost-effective solution as it represents massive changes in city infrastructures that have been present for decades. Urban planning shapes the environment around us but fails to address specifically the future traffic clogging. Our research tackles the problem of traffic congestion by proposing a system for vehicle detection, identification, and count, allied with reinforcement learning for traffic congestion anticipation and prediction. The need for a real-time and efficient system led us to push the research and development onto an Edge Computing platform using IoT and secure transactions using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Blockchain intervenes as a security protocol in the proposed system. The native form of Internet of Things does not include security protocols which are important to a large scale implementation. Ensuring the security of transactions and permanent access control is the main reason why blockchain is rooted in our system architecture. Our project aims to reduce the traffic load on roads experiencing significant congestion, and improve overall city traffic system without costly investment into new communication infrastructures and city planning. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["edge computing","traffic load","traffic system","reinforcement learning","traffic congestion","access control","address specifically","balancing using","blockchain blockchain","blockchain intervenes","city infrastructures","city planning","city traffic","communication infrastructures","computing platform","congestion anticipation","congestion represents","constantly growing","costly investment","count allied","decades urban","detection identification","economy solving","efficient economy","efficient traffic","experiencing significant","fabric blockchain","future traffic","government infrastructures","growing cities","hyperledger fabric","implementation ensuring","improve overall","include security","large scale","learning congestion","load balancing","main reason","major priority","major problems","massive changes","native form","new communication","overall city","permanent access","planning shapes","platform using","project aims","proposing system","represents massive","research tackles","roads experiencing","scale implementation","secure traffic","secure transactions","security protocol","security protocols","significant congestion","system architecture","system led","traffic clogging","traffic represents","transactions using","using edge","using hyperledger","using iot","efficient system","vehicle detection","proposed system","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["edge computing","traffic load","traffic system","traffic congestion","reinforcement learning","access control","address specifically","balancing using","blockchain blockchain","blockchain intervenes","city infrastructures","city planning","city traffic","communication infrastructures","computing platform","congestion anticipation","congestion represents","constantly growing","costly investment","count allied","decades urban","detection identification","economy solving","efficient economy","efficient system","efficient traffic","experiencing significant","fabric blockchain","future traffic","government infrastructures","growing cities","hyperledger fabric","implementation ensuring","improve overall","include security","large scale","learning congestion","load balancing","main reason","major priority","major problems","massive changes","native form","new communication","overall city","permanent access","planning shapes","platform using","project aims","proposing system","represents massive","research tackles","roads experiencing","scale implementation","secure traffic","secure transactions","security protocol","security protocols","significant congestion","system architecture","system led","traffic clogging","traffic represents","transactions using","using edge","using hyperledger","using iot","vehicle detection","proposed system","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["edge computing","traffic load","traffic system","traffic congestion","reinforcement learning","access control","address specifically","balancing using","blockchain blockchain","blockchain intervenes","city infrastructures","city planning","city traffic","communication infrastructures","computing platform","congestion anticipation","congestion represents","constantly growing","costly investment","count allied","decades urban","detection identification","economy solving","efficient economy","efficient system","efficient traffic","experiencing significant","fabric blockchain","future traffic","government infrastructures","growing cities","hyperledger fabric","implementation ensuring","improve overall","include security","large scale","learning congestion","load balancing","main reason","major priority","major problems","massive changes","native form","new communication","overall city","permanent access","planning shapes","platform using","project aims","proposing system","represents massive","research tackles","roads experiencing","scale implementation","secure traffic","secure transactions","security protocol","security protocols","significant congestion","system architecture","system led","traffic clogging","traffic represents","transactions using","using edge","using hyperledger","using iot","vehicle detection","proposed system","urban planning"]},{"DocId":300,"Year":2019,"Title":"Spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and cropland in the Nile Delta of Egypt using machine learning and satellite big data: implications for sustainable development","Abstract":"The Nile Delta of Egypt is increasingly facing sustainability threats, due to a combination of nature- and human-induced changes in land cover and land use. In this paper, an analysis of big time series data from remotely sensed satellite images and the random forests classifier was undertaken to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of urbanization and cropland in the Nile Delta between 2007 and 2017. Out of thirteen variables, five spectral indices were chosen to build 500 decision trees, with a resulting overall accuracy average of 91.9 \u00b1 1.5%. The results revealed that the urban extent in the Nile Delta has increased, between 2007 and 2017, by 592.4 km2 (1.92%). Particularly, the results indicated that the years 2011 and 2012, which coincided the 2011 political uprising in Egypt, so-called the Arab Spring, were associated with significant land-use changes in the Nile Delta, both in rate and scale. As a result, the cropland area in the region decreased between 2010 and 2011 by 1.63% (502.21 km2). Moreover, the results showed that during the period 2012\u20132017, the mean annual urbanization rate in the region stood at 60 km2\/year. In contrast, croplands decreased during the same period at an average annual rate of 2 km2\/year. At the governorates\u2019 level, the results suggested that top agricultural producing governorates in the Nile Delta, such as Elmonoufia, Elkalubia, Elbouhyra, and Elghrbia, witnessed the highest rates of decrease in cropland areas during the period 2012\u20132017. Over the same period, urban areas increased the most in Elkalubia, Domiate, and Elmonoufia by 1.98%, 1.72%, and 1.34%, respectively. The f indings from this analysis are discussed along with their implications for sustainable land-use and urban planning policies. \u00a9 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["nile delta","accuracy average","agricultural producing","annual urbanization","arab spring","areas increased","big time","build decision","contrast croplands","cropland areas","croplands decreased","data implications","egypt using","elghrbia witnessed","elkalubia domiate","elkalubia elbouhyra","elmonoufia elkalubia","facing sustainability","five spectral","forests classifier","governorates level","highest rates","increasingly facing","mean annual","period urban","political uprising","producing governorates","region decreased","region stood","resulting overall","results suggested","satellite big","sensed satellite","spectral indices","sustainability threats","thirteen variables","threats due","urban extent","urbanization rate","variables five","annual rate","average annual","cropland area","planning policies","series data","spatiotemporal dynamics","temporal dynamics","time series","decision trees","significant changes","sustainable development","random forests","results revealed","big data","results indicated","using machine","remotely sensed","results showed","satellite images","urban areas","overall accuracy","land cover","land use","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["nile delta","accuracy average","agricultural producing","annual rate","annual urbanization","arab spring","areas increased","average annual","big data","big time","build decision","contrast croplands","cropland area","cropland areas","croplands decreased","data implications","decision trees","egypt using","elghrbia witnessed","elkalubia domiate","elkalubia elbouhyra","elmonoufia elkalubia","facing sustainability","five spectral","forests classifier","governorates level","highest rates","increasingly facing","mean annual","period urban","planning policies","political uprising","producing governorates","random forests","region decreased","region stood","remotely sensed","resulting overall","results suggested","satellite big","sensed satellite","series data","significant changes","spectral indices","sustainability threats","sustainable development","temporal dynamics","thirteen variables","threats due","time series","urban extent","urbanization rate","variables five","results indicated","results revealed","spatiotemporal dynamics","urban areas","land cover","overall accuracy","satellite images","using machine","land use","results showed","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["nile delta","accuracy average","agricultural producing","annual urbanization","arab spring","areas increased","average annual","big data","big time","build decision","contrast croplands","cropland areas","croplands decreased","data implications","decision trees","egypt using","elghrbia witnessed","elkalubia domiate","elkalubia elbouhyra","elmonoufia elkalubia","facing sustainability","five spectral","forests classifier","governorates level","highest rates","increasingly facing","mean annual","period urban","planning policies","political uprising","producing governorates","random forests","region decreased","region stood","remotely sensed","resulting overall","results suggested","satellite big","sensed satellite","series data","significant changes","spectral indices","sustainability threats","thirteen variables","threats due","time series","urban extent","urbanization rate","variables five","annual rate","cropland area","results indicated","results revealed","spatiotemporal dynamics","sustainable development","temporal dynamics","using machine","overall accuracy","satellite images","urban areas","results showed","land cover","land use","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":301,"Year":2019,"Title":"ADMSv2: A modern architecture for transportation data management and analysis","Abstract":"This paper presents ADMSv2, an end-to-end data-driven system that enables real-time and historical data analytics and machine learning tasks over big, streaming, spatiotemporal data.

We propose to examine complex public transit travel patterns over a large-scale transit network, which is challenging since it involves thousands of transit passengers and massive data from heterogeneous sources. Additionally, efficient representation and visualization of discovered travel patterns is difficult given a large number of transit trips. To address these challenges, this study leverages advanced machine learning methods to identify time-varying mobility patterns based on smart card data and other urban data. The proposed approach delivers a comprehensive solution to pre-process, analyze, and visualize complex public transit travel patterns. This approach first fuses smart card data with other urban data to reconstruct original transit trips.We use two machine learning methods, including a clustering algorithm to extract transit corridors to represent primarymobility connections between different regions and a graph-embedding algorithmto discover hierarchical mobility community structures.We also devise compact and effective multi-scale visualization forms to represent the discovered travel behavior dynamics. An interactive web-based mapping prototype is developed to integrate advanced machine learning methods with specific visualizations to characterize transit travel behavior patterns and to enable visual exploration of transit mobility patterns at different scales and resolutions over space and time. The proposed approach is evaluated using multi-source big transit data (e.g., smart card data, transit network data, and bus trajectory data) collected in Shenzhen City, China.

The second proposed urban modeling technique is an artificial urban modeling technique without any airborne LiDAR resources that applies an adaptive spacing method, an iterative algorithm to define an artificial urban environment.

This is a scientifically challenging proposition, as it requires new methods to fuse objective (heterogeneous) data (e.g. people location trails and sensors data) with subjective (perceptual) data (e.g. the citizens' quality of experience collected through feedback forms). When it comes to vast urban areas, collecting statistically significant data is a daunting task; thus new data-collection methods are required too. In this work, we turn to artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges, introducing a method whereby the objective, sensor data is analyzed in real-time to scope down the test matrix of the subjective questionnaires. In turn, subjective responses are parsed through AI models to extract further objective information. The outcome is an interactive data analysis framework for urban environments, which we put to test in the context of a citizens' well-being project. In our pilot study, each new entry (objective or subjective) is parsed through the AI engine to determine which action maximizes the information gain. This translates into a particular question being fired at a specific moment and place, to a specific person. With our AI data collection method, we can reach statistical significance much faster, achieving (in our city-wide pilot study) a 41% acceleration factor and a 75% reduction in intrusiveness. Our study opens new avenues in urban science, with potential applications in urban planning, citizen's well-being projects, and sociology, to mention but a few cases. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban environments","new methods","pilot study","acceleration factor","action maximizes","ai approach","ai data","ai engine","ai models","analysis framework","analyzing human","areas collecting","better understand","challenges introducing","challenging proposition","citizen projects","citizens interact","citizens project","citizens quality","collect vast","collecting statistically","collection method","data analysis","data people","entry objective","environments thanks","experience collected","faster achieving","feedback forms","fuse objective","heterogeneous data","human interactions","improve human","information gain","introducing method","location trails","new avenues","new entry","objective heterogeneous","objective information","objective sensor","opens new","particular question","people location","perceptual data","planning citizen","potential applications","reach statistical","requires new","scientifically challenging","sensor data","sensors data","significant data","specific moment","specific person","statistical significance","statistically significant","study acceleration","study opens","subjective perceptual","subjective questionnaires","subjective responses","test matrix","turn improve","turn subjective","urban science","vast amounts","vast urban","data collection","daunting task","interactive data","urban areas","urban data","intelligence ai","urban planning","artificial intelligence"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban environments","pilot study","new methods","acceleration factor","action maximizes","ai approach","ai data","ai engine","analysis framework","analyzing human","areas collecting","better understand","challenges introducing","challenging proposition","citizen projects","citizens interact","citizens project","citizens quality","collect vast","collecting statistically","collection method","data people","daunting task","entry objective","environments thanks","experience collected","faster achieving","feedback forms","fuse objective","heterogeneous data","human interactions","improve human","information gain","interactive data","introducing method","location trails","new avenues","new entry","objective heterogeneous","objective information","objective sensor","opens new","particular question","people location","perceptual data","planning citizen","potential applications","reach statistical","requires new","scientifically challenging","sensor data","significant data","specific moment","specific person","statistical significance","study acceleration","study opens","subjective perceptual","subjective questionnaires","subjective responses","test matrix","turn improve","turn subjective","urban science","vast amounts","vast urban","ai models","data collection","sensors data","statistically significant","data analysis","intelligence ai","artificial intelligence","urban data","urban areas","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban environments","new methods","pilot study","acceleration factor","action maximizes","ai approach","ai data","ai engine","ai models","analysis framework","analyzing human","areas collecting","artificial intelligence","challenges introducing","challenging proposition","citizen projects","citizens interact","citizens project","citizens quality","collect vast","collecting statistically","collection method","data collection","data people","daunting task","entry objective","environments thanks","experience collected","faster achieving","feedback forms","fuse objective","heterogeneous data","human interactions","improve human","information gain","intelligence ai","interactive data","introducing method","location trails","new avenues","new entry","objective heterogeneous","objective information","objective sensor","opens new","particular question","people location","perceptual data","planning citizen","potential applications","reach statistical","requires new","scientifically challenging","sensor data","sensors data","significant data","specific moment","specific person","statistical significance","statistically significant","study acceleration","study opens","subjective perceptual","subjective questionnaires","subjective responses","test matrix","turn improve","turn subjective","urban areas","urban science","vast amounts","vast urban","better understand","urban data","data analysis","urban planning"]},{"DocId":313,"Year":2019,"Title":"Multi-scale correlation-based feature selection and random forest classification for LULC mapping from the integration of SAR and optical Sentinel images","Abstract":"Reliable and accurate land use\/land cover (LULC) map is a crucial data source for the understanding of coupled human-environment systems, monitoring changes, timely low-cost planning, and management of natural resources. Improvements in sensor technologies and machine learning capabilities have shifted the attention of remote sensing community to data complementarity through fusion of multi-sensor data for accurate feature extraction and mapping. Amalgamation of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has shown promising advantages in enhancing the accuracy of extracting LULC as such method allows exploitation of information in sensors. This study investigated the potential of using freely available multisource Sentinel images to extract LULC maps in semi-arid environments through multi-scale geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). A multi-scale classification framework that integrates GEOBIA, correlation-based feature selection (CFS), and random forest (RF)-supervised classification was adopted to extract LULC from assimilation of Sentinel multi-sensor products. First, Sentinel-1 and-2 images were pre-processed. Second, optimum multi-scale segmentation levels were selected using F-score segmentation quality measures. Third, 70 features of various spectral indices and derivatives and geometrical features from optical data and multiple ratios and textural features from dual-polarization SAR images were computed, and a CFS based on wrapper approach was used to select the most significant features at multi-scale levels. Finally, a single and multi-scale RF classifier was used to extract LULC classes using the most relevant features extracted from Sentinel SAR and optical images. Results of multi-scale image segmentation optimization showed that scale parameter (SP) values of 40, 60, and 150 were optimal for extraction of LULC classes. Results of feature selection showed that 22, 24, and 27 features were selected at scale SP values of 40, 60, and 150, respectively. Half of the features were common among the three scales. Single RF classification yielded overall accuracy (OA) values of 92.10%, 93%, and 91% and kappa coefficients of 0.901, 0.912, and 0.89 at scale values of 150, 60, and 40, respectively. Multiscale RF classification from scale values of 150 and 60 produced better LULC classification with OA 96.06% and kappa coefficient of 0.95 compared with other scale SP values. The integrated approach demonstrated an effective and promising method for high-quality LULC extraction from coupling optical and SAR images. Overall, multi-sensor Sentinel images along with the adopted approach feature a remarkable potential for improving LULC extraction and can effectively be used to update geographic information system layers for various applications. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["extract lulc","feature selection","rf classification","sentinel images","sp values","sar

visual environment of any modern city. Advertising and information signs on building fa\u00e7ades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on fa\u00e7ades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of fa\u00e7ade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building fa\u00e7ades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality. The resulting approach can provide data for future research and help maintain coherent urban visual environment. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Various studies in the field of urban planning and design have given recommendations on \u201cgood urban form\u201d, suggesting that especially characteristics of the urban morphology inform the quality of locations and additionally influence spatial behavior. While we find a growing number of quantitative spatial models such as hedonic price models, location choice models, or applied machine learning algorithms, characteristics describing the urban morphology are still rarely reported in these. One reason can be found in the limited knowledge on how to characterize the urban morphology best. In this chapter, we address this deficit and define attributes that are suitable to characterize the urban morphology in quantitative means at different scales. We show how these can be processed from a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in most study areas and process them for the case study of Switzerland. Finally, we use the attributes to define urban typologies through clustering methods.

Applications include furniture arrangement, space partitioning (e.g. subdividing a house into rooms), urban planning, and other design tasks. Computer-aided support systems are essential tools for architects and designers to produce custom, functional layouts. Existing systems, however, do not learn the designer\u2019s preferences, and therefore fail to generalize across sessions or instances. We propose addressing layout synthesis by casting it as a constructive preference elicitation task. Our solution employs a coactive interaction protocol, whereby the system and the designer interact by mutually improving each other\u2019s proposals. The system iteratively recommends layouts to the user, and learns the user\u2019s preferences by observing her improvements to the recommendations. We apply our system to two design tasks, furniture arrangement and space partitioning, and report promising quantitative and qualitative results on both.

This framework allows designers to address performance measures, urban measures and aesthetic criteria in an adaptive, interactive generative design approach. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the structure and the nature of the framework and the application of human-in-the-loop design systems to urban design. Design\/methodology\/approach: Significant literature reviewed lead to the identification of an application potential in the decision-making process. This potential is situated around the use of AI for the evaluation of subjective performance criteria in a DSS. Recognising that the key decisions about urban aesthetics are based on the individual evaluation of the designer, an HITL approach for computational design software to support creative decisions is presented in this paper. Findings: Urban typogenetics for interactive generative urban design allows the exploration of complex design spaces by using a human-in-the-loop design system in the context of urban aesthetics. Hybrid aesthetic evaluation allows the designer to analyse morphological features and urban aesthetics during exploratory search and reveal hidden aspects of the urban context by visualisation of the results of the aesthetic evaluation. Integrating performance measures and urban aesthetics in urban typogenetics addresses major criteria of urban design at the beginning of the creative process. Originality\/value: The use of a broad interactive approach to typogenetic design in an application to urban scenarios is a novel conceptual approach to the design of urban configurations. The suggested adaptive mechanism would allow the user of a typogenetic tool to subjectively evaluate solutions by sight and reason about aesthetic, social and cultural implication of the reviewed design solutions. \u00a9 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban aesthetics","performance measures","urban typogenetics","aesthetic

In particular, the decision process is the main component of every military operation and is of high interest because of two main reasons : it is necessary designed to cope with conflict issues and it requires a very complex planning process to be successful. The difficulty to find a good plan is worse in urban areas because of the high uncertainty due to the topology of these areas, the presence of civilians, who can be hostile or friendly, and the unpredictable nature of enemies. The idea in that paper is to qualify what can be a valid computed plan in that context, i.e. well-designed for recovering of peace, rescue operations after a bombing event, hostage salvage, non-combatant evacuation operations, civil-military co-operation, ., in urban areas. This planning process leads to associate actually four components, the representation of the tactical scheme, the implementation of the tactical scheme as the behaviour of special forces, military units or emergency squads, the proof process or the explanation process, and finally the handling of external factors depending on the current environment or the current context in which the operation takes place. This paper uses a quaternary representation called the epistemological quadriptych, in order to highlight that the integration of UGVs or UAVs devices requires actually to understand the role of knowledge and behaviour and to provide secure and valid action plans, i.e. which can be explained and justified.

It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["sgcc dataset","classes normal","electricity

metropolitan areas in the United States of America","Abstract":"Urban land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of various land use types are critically important for urban planning, environmental management, disaster control, health protection, and biodiversity conservation. Recent advances in remote sensing and social sensing data and methods have shown great potentials in mapping urban land use categories, but they are still constrained by mixed land uses, limited predictors, non-localized models, and often relatively low accuracies. To inform these issues, we proposed a robust and cost-effective framework for mapping urban land use categories using openly available multi-source geospatial \u201cbig data\u201d. With street blocks generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the minimum classification unit, we integrated an expansive set of multi-scale spatially explicit information on land surface, vertical height, socio-economic attributes, social media, demography, and topography. We further proposed to apply the automatic ensemble learning that leverages a bunch of machine learning algorithms in deriving optimal urban land use classification maps. Results of block-level urban land use classification in five metropolitan areas of the United States found the overall accuracies of major-class (Level-I) and minor-class (Level-II) classification could be high as 91% and 86%, respectively. A multi-model comparison revealed that for urban land use classification with high-dimensional features, the multi-layer stacking ensemble models achieved better performance than base models such as random forest, extremely randomized trees, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks. We found without very-high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery, the classification results derived from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and other open big data based features could achieve plausible overall accuracies of Level-I and Level-II classification at 88% and 81%, respectively. We also found that model transferability depended highly on the heterogeneity in characteristics of different regions. The methods and findings in this study systematically elucidate the role of data sources, classification methods, and feature transferability in block-level land use classifications, which have important implications for mapping multi-scale essential urban land use categories. \u00a9 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

comparative study of Bayes network, Hoeffding tree and logistic model tree for landslide susceptibility modeling","Abstract":"Landslides, one of the most common hazards around the world, have brought about severe damage to life and property of human. To prevent and mitigate landslides, various models have been introduced to assess landslide susceptibility. In this paper, Hoeffding Tree (HT), a prevailing data stream mining algorithm, was employed to predict landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China for the first time. Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances. Concretely, for training dataset, LMT model showed the highest AUC (0.854), followed by HT (0.726) and BN (0.709). However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China. Additionally, this study proved that HT model is a promising classifier for landslide susceptibility modeling. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["landslide

the availability of smart metering infrastructure, high-resolution electric consumption data is readily available to study the dynamics of residential electric consumption at finely resolved spatial and temporal scales. Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer\u2019s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

many researchers to analyze a wide range of information from satellite imagery. Settlement information that includes building foot prints is a very essential parameter for different applications such as urban planning, environmental planning and disaster management. VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group) conventional neural network (CNN) model is a popular model used to detect and classify the input images. In this study, a new approach was proposed by integration of VGG-16-CNN model with spectral and textural information of satellite images for identification of building foot prints. The model was trained and implemented to identify the building footprints using Worldview-3 high-resolution satellite image over part of Mumbai city of Maharashtra state, India. Classification accuracy in the proposed approach is observed to be nearly 94% as compared to 82% in case of single-shot detector (SSD) algorithm alone. Metric parameters such as F1 score of 0.957, intersection over union (IoU) of 94.86% and total error rate of 8.133% also indicated better performance of the proposed approach.

The accurate mapping of the RLP dynamics require reliable land price prediction models and data with fine spatial and temporal resolution. With the aid of point of interest (POI) data and nighttime light (NTL) images, this paper attempts to explore the ability of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to model grid-level RLPs using the case of Wuhan in China. Several land price prediction models were built using five MLAs and various geographic variables. The experimental results show that the extra-trees regression algorithm and the radial basis function-based support vector regression algorithm perform best in Period \u2160 (2010\u20132014) and Period \u2161 (2015\u20132019), respectively; therefore, they were selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids without observations in the corresponding period. Based on the estimated results, we found that the spatial pattern of the RLP in Wuhan transitioned from monocentric to polycentric between the two periods, and RLPs grew rapidly near newly formed urban subcenters and waterscapes. The relative importance of the predictor variables shows that commercial and educational facilities are important determinants of the RLP distribution in Wuhan; moreover, the relative importance of natural amenities and education facilities increased over time, while that of commercial facilities and public transportation decreased slightly. The case of Wuhan confirms the feasibility of MLAs and openly accessible urban data in modeling fine-scale RLP distributions. Our proposed framework provides a new approach to monitor the urban land price dynamics accurately and closely, which is beneficial for improving the infrastructure layout and achieve smart city

inexpensive tool to detect urban surface temperature changes associated with urbanization processes in small cities","Abstract":"A consequence of urbanization is the loss of vegetation cover, replaced by urban areas. This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["built area","normalized difference","surface temperature","adaptation providing","analysis indicates","analysis indicating","area intensification","cdi values","change detection","changes associated","cities consequence","clustering tool","cover replaced","create groups","detect urban","detection index","difference index","evaluate urban","evident increase","facilitated dialogue","highlight areas","housing complex","implantation area","increase confirming","index cdi","index ndbi","indicates priority","indicating heat","inexpensive tool","island potential","learning clustering","lst changes","lst simple","methodology applicable","monitoring data","ndvi normalized","penedo located","potential formation","process monitoring","providing indicators","simple methodology","simple tool","small cities","spatial analysis","stakeholders associated","study investigates","summarizes ndbi","temperature changes","temperature increase","urban landscape","urbanization process","urbanization processes","vegetation cover","cluster analysis","difference vegetation","index ndvi","priority areas","urban surface","vegetation index","urban studies","temperature lst","case study","heat island","land surface","urban areas","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["built area","normalized difference","surface temperature","adaptation providing","analysis indicates","analysis indicating","area intensification","cdi values","change detection","changes associated","cities consequence","cluster analysis","clustering tool","cover replaced","create groups","detect urban","detection index","difference index","evaluate urban","evident increase","facilitated dialogue","highlight areas","housing complex","implantation area","increase confirming","index cdi","index ndbi","indicates priority","indicating heat","inexpensive tool","island potential","learning clustering","lst changes","lst simple","methodology applicable","monitoring data","ndvi normalized","penedo located","potential formation","priority areas","process monitoring","providing indicators","simple methodology","simple tool","small cities","spatial analysis","stakeholders associated","study investigates","summarizes ndbi","temperature changes","temperature increase","urban landscape","urbanization process","urbanization processes","vegetation cover","difference vegetation","index ndvi","urban studies","urban surface","case study","vegetation index","temperature lst","urban areas","heat island","land surface","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["built area","normalized difference","surface temperature","adaptation providing","analysis indicates","analysis indicating","area intensification","cdi values","change detection","changes associated","cities consequence","cluster analysis","clustering tool","cover replaced","create groups","detect urban","detection index","difference index","evaluate urban","evident increase","facilitated dialogue","highlight areas","housing complex","implantation area","increase confirming","index cdi","index ndbi","indicates priority","indicating heat","inexpensive tool","island potential","learning clustering","lst changes","lst simple","methodology applicable","monitoring data","ndvi normalized","penedo located","potential formation","priority areas","process monitoring","providing indicators","simple methodology","simple tool","small cities","spatial analysis","stakeholders associated","study investigates","summarizes ndbi","temperature changes","temperature increase","urban landscape","urbanization process","urbanization processes","vegetation cover","difference vegetation","index ndvi","urban studies","urban surface","case study","vegetation index","temperature lst","urban areas","heat island","land surface","machine learning"]},{"DocId":331,"Year":2021,"Title":"Measuring heterogeneous perception of urban space with massive data and machine learning: An application to safety","Abstract":"In the last decade, large street imagery data sets and machine learning developments have allowed increasing scalability of methodologies to understand the effects of landscape attributes on the way they are perceived. However, these new methodologies have not incorporated individual heterogeneity in their analysis, even though differences by gender and other sociodemographic characteristics in the perception of safety and other aspects of landscapes and public spaces have been widely studied in social sciences and urban planning in lower scale studies. In the present study, we combine computational and statistical tools to develop a methodological proposal with high scalability and low implementation cost, which helps to identify and measure heterogeneous perception and its correlation to the presence of elements in the landscape. To achieve this, we implement a survey of perception of public spaces, collecting sociodemographic information of respondents. Then, we fit a discrete choice model to quantify perceptions of these spaces using a parametrization of images that jointly considers semantic segmentation and object detection as input. Our results show heterogeneity in the perception of safety in public spaces according to gender and the observer's habitual mobility choices. The model is then applied to the city of Santiago, Chile. This produces a map of safety perception for different types of users. The proposed method and the obtained results can be a relevant input for the design of public spaces and decision making in the urban planning process. \u00a9 2020","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["public spaces","heterogeneous perception","allowed increasing","choice model","collecting sociodemographic","combine computational","considers semantic","decade large","develop methodological","fit discrete","habitual mobility","high scalability","imagery data","implement survey","implementation cost","incorporated individual","increasing scalability","individual heterogeneity","jointly considers","landscape attributes","large street","learning developments","low implementation","lower scale","measure heterogeneous","measuring heterogeneous","methodological proposal","mobility choices","object detection","observer habitual","obtained results","produces map","relevant input","scale studies","semantic segmentation","show heterogeneity","social sciences","sociodemographic characteristics","sociodemographic information","spaces according","spaces collecting","statistical tools","street imagery","using parametrization","widely studied","urban planning","data sets","discrete choice","massive data","new methodologies","present study","quantify perceptions","safety perception","santiago chile","spaces using","different types","decision making","planning process","proposed method","results show","urban space","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["public spaces","heterogeneous perception","urban planning","allowed increasing","choice model","collecting sociodemographic","combine computational","considers semantic","data sets","decade large","decision making","develop methodological","different types","fit discrete","habitual mobility","high scalability","imagery data","implement survey","implementation cost","incorporated individual","increasing scalability","individual heterogeneity","jointly considers","landscape attributes","large street","learning developments","low implementation","lower scale","measure heterogeneous","measuring heterogeneous","methodological proposal","mobility choices","object detection","observer habitual","obtained results","present study","produces map","relevant input","scale studies","semantic segmentation","show heterogeneity","social sciences","sociodemographic characteristics","sociodemographic information","spaces according","spaces collecting","spaces using","statistical tools","street imagery","using parametrization","widely studied","discrete choice","massive data","new methodologies","proposed method","quantify perceptions","results show","safety perception","santiago chile","planning process","urban space","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["public spaces","heterogeneous perception","urban planning","allowed increasing","choice model","collecting sociodemographic","combine computational","considers semantic","data sets","decade large","decision making","develop methodological","different types","fit discrete","habitual mobility","high scalability","imagery data","implement survey","implementation cost","incorporated individual","increasing scalability","individual heterogeneity","jointly considers","landscape attributes","large street","learning developments","low implementation","lower scale","measure heterogeneous","measuring heterogeneous","methodological proposal","mobility choices","new methodologies","object detection","observer habitual","obtained results","present study","produces map","relevant input","scale studies","semantic segmentation","show heterogeneity","social sciences","sociodemographic characteristics","sociodemographic information","spaces according","spaces collecting","spaces using","statistical tools","street imagery","urban space","using parametrization","widely studied","discrete choice","massive data","quantify perceptions","safety perception","santiago chile","machine learning","proposed method","results show","planning process"]},{"DocId":332,"Year":2021,"Title":"Using satellite image fusion to evaluate the impact of land use changes on ecosystem services and their economic values","Abstract":"Accelerated land use change is a current challenge for environmental management world-wide. Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004\u20132019) from fused image-ries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Im-ager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use\/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local au-thorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This paper develops a new analytical framework based on a wealth of empirical data on both safety\/security and socio-economic magnetism achievements of many world cities, by combining two comprehensive relevant global urban data bases. The aim of the study is to offer a comparative analysis of the combined safety\/security data and socio-economic performance data of 30 global cities, through the use of an advanced sequential cluster dynamics analysis that is (partly) inspired by a novel machine learning approach (using Python software). In this way, cities can be categorized according to their quantitative characteristic features represented by the relevant clusters. It appears that city safety\/security features are an important predictor of the variability in overall urban performance regarding magnetism.

Currently, various methods such as the machine learning algorithms, statistical methods, and semantic analysis are widely applied to identify and extract human mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a simple and generic paradigm for mining human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data using complex network analysis. The essential ideas behind the proposed paradigm mainly include (1) creating weighted complex networks of GPS trajectories and (2) extracting the human mobility patterns by analyzing the structures and metrics of the created complex networks of GPS trajectories. To evaluate the performance of the proposed paradigm, we design five groups of experiments and identify the mobility patterns of the selected five persons based on the selected five network analysis metrics. Experimental results indicate that (1) the proposed paradigm is effective and (2) the quite interesting potential information about the human mobility can be mined easily. The proposed paradigm is simple and generic, which can be employed to rapidly identify the human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data. \u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["human mobility","mobility patterns","proposed paradigm","network analysis","gps trajectory","patterns based","trajectory data","complex network","complex networks","generic paradigm","mining human","selected five","using complex","data using","gps trajectories","algorithms statistical","analysis metrics","created complex","creating weighted","currently various","design five","essential ideas","extract human","five groups","five network","five persons","include creating","interesting potential","mainly include","metrics experimental","mined easily","paradigm mainly","persons based","planning route","potential information","propose simple","quite interesting","rapidly identify","recommendations urban","route recommendations","semantic analysis","statistical methods","traffic planning","use currently","various methods","weighted complex","emergency management","planning emergency","results indicate","widely applied","experimental results","land use","learning algorithms","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["human mobility","mobility patterns","proposed paradigm","patterns based","gps trajectory","network analysis","trajectory data","complex network","complex networks","data using","generic paradigm","mining human","selected five","using complex","gps trajectories","algorithms statistical","analysis metrics","created complex","creating weighted","currently various","design five","essential ideas","extract human","five groups","five network","five persons","include creating","interesting potential","mainly include","metrics experimental","mined easily","paradigm mainly","persons based","planning route","potential information","propose simple","quite interesting","rapidly identify","recommendations urban","route recommendations","semantic analysis","statistical methods","traffic planning","use currently","various methods","weighted complex","planning emergency","results indicate","widely applied","emergency management","land use","learning algorithms","experimental results","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["human mobility","mobility patterns","proposed paradigm","gps trajectory","network analysis","patterns based","trajectory data","complex network","complex networks","data using","generic paradigm","selected five","using complex","gps trajectories","mining human","algorithms statistical","analysis metrics","created complex","creating weighted","currently various","design five","essential ideas","extract human","five groups","five network","five persons","include creating","interesting potential","mainly include","metrics experimental","mined easily","paradigm mainly","persons based","planning route","potential information","propose simple","quite interesting","rapidly identify","recommendations urban","results indicate","route recommendations","semantic analysis","statistical methods","traffic planning","use currently","various methods","weighted complex","widely applied","emergency management","experimental results","planning emergency","land use","learning algorithms","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":335,"Year":2021,"Title":"Research on the big data of traditional taxi and online car-hailing: A systematic review","Abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of a quick overview of the latest developments and unprecedented opportunities for scholars who want to set foot in the field of traditional taxi and online car-hailing (TTOC). From the perspectives of peoples (e.g., passenger, driver, and policymaker), vehicle, road, and environment, this paper describes the current research status of TTOC's big data in six hot topics, including the ridership factor, spatio-temporal distribution and travel behavior, cruising strategy and passenger service market partition, route planning, transportation emission and new-energy, and TTOC's data extensional application. These topics were included in five mainstreams as follows: (1) abundant studies often focus only on determinant analysis on given transportation (taxi, transit, online car-hailing); the exploration of ridership patterns for a multi-modal transportation mode is rare; furthermore, multiple aspects of factors were not considered synchronously in a wide time span; (2) travel behavior research mainly concentrates on the commuting trips and distribution patterns of various travel indices (e.g., distance, displacement, time); (3) the taxi driver-searching strategy can be divided into autopsychic cruising and system dispatching; (4) the spatio-temporal distribution character of TTOC's fuel consumption (FC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a hotspot recently, and there has been a recommendation for electric taxi (ET) in urban cities to decrease transportation congestion is proposed; and (5) based on TTOC and point of interest (POI) multi-source data, many machine learning algorithms were used to predict travel condition indices, land use, and travel behavior. Then, the main bottlenecks and research directions that can be explored in the future are discussed.

Spatiotemporal Behavioral Demand","Abstract":"Delineating life circles is an essential prerequisite for urban community life circle planning. Recent studies combined the environmental contexts with residents\u2019 global positioning system (GPS) data to delineate the life circles. This method, however, is constrained by GPS data, and it can only be applied in the GPS surveyed communities. To address this limitation, this study developed a generalizable delineation method without the constraint of behavioral data. According to previous research, the community life circle consists of the walking-accessible range and internal structure. The core task to develop the generalizable method was to estimate the spatiotemporal behavioral demand for each plot of land to acquire the internal structure of the life circle, as the range can be delineated primarily based on environmental data. Therefore, behavioral demand estimation models were established through logistic regression and machine learning techniques, including decision trees and ensemble learning. The model with the lowest error rate was chosen as the final estimation model for each type of land. Finally, we used a community without GPS data as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimation models and delineation method. This article extends the existing literature by introducing spatiotemporal behavioral demand estimation models, which learn the relationships between environmental contexts, population composition and the existing delineated results based on GPS data to delineate the internal structure of the community life circle without employing behavioral data. Furthermore, the proposed method and delineation results also contributes to facilities adjustments and location selections in life circle planning, people-oriented transformation in urban planning, and activity space estimation of the population in evaluating and improving the urban policies. \u00a9 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["life circle","behavioral demand","community life","gps data","estimation models","internal structure","spatiotemporal behavioral","behavioral data","circle planning","delineation method","demand estimation","environmental contexts","life circles","urban community","activity space","article extends","circle based","circle consists","contexts population","core task","data according","delineated primarily","delineated results","delineating life","delineation results","demand delineating","developed generalizable","employing behavioral","ensemble learning","environmental data","error rate","essential prerequisite","estimation model","existing delineated","facilities adjustments","final estimation","generalizable delineation","generalizable method","gps surveyed","including decision","introducing spatiotemporal","land finally","location selections","lowest error","planning recent","planning transformation","population composition","positioning system","previous research","primarily based","recent studies","residents global","results based","space estimation","studies combined","study developed","surveyed communities","system gps","techniques including","decision trees","existing literature","global positioning","logistic regression","urban policies","proposed method","learning techniques","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["life circle","behavioral demand","community life","gps data","estimation models","internal structure","spatiotemporal behavioral","behavioral data","circle planning","delineation method","demand estimation","life circles","urban community","environmental contexts","activity space","article extends","circle based","circle consists","contexts population","core task","data according","decision trees","delineated primarily","delineated results","delineating life","delineation results","demand delineating","developed generalizable","employing behavioral","ensemble learning","environmental data","error rate","essential prerequisite","estimation model","existing delineated","facilities adjustments","final estimation","generalizable delineation","generalizable method","gps surveyed","including decision","introducing spatiotemporal","land finally","location selections","lowest error","planning recent","planning transformation","population composition","primarily based","recent studies","residents global","space estimation","studies combined","study developed","surveyed communities","system gps","techniques including","existing literature","global positioning","logistic regression","positioning system","previous research","results based","urban policies","learning techniques","proposed method","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["life circle","behavioral demand","community life","gps data","estimation models","internal structure","spatiotemporal behavioral","behavioral data","circle planning","delineation method","demand estimation","environmental contexts","life circles","urban community","activity space","article extends","circle based","circle consists","contexts population","core task","data according","decision trees","delineated primarily","delineated results","delineating life","delineation results","demand delineating","developed generalizable","employing behavioral","ensemble learning","environmental data","error rate","essential prerequisite","estimation model","existing delineated","existing literature","facilities adjustments","final estimation","generalizable delineation","generalizable method","global positioning","gps surveyed","including decision","introducing spatiotemporal","land finally","location selections","logistic regression","lowest error","planning recent","planning transformation","population composition","positioning system","previous research","primarily based","proposed method","recent studies","residents global","results based","space estimation","studies combined","study developed","surveyed communities","system gps","techniques including","urban policies","learning techniques","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":337,"Year":2021,"Title":"A Review of AI for Urban Planning: Towards Building Sustainable Smart Cities","Abstract":"Urban planning, in short, deals with solving the problems of the modern society.

Model performance can be improved by integrating exogenous features from open data repositories (e.g., weather, housing prices, traffic, etc.), but these uncurated sources are often too noisy, incomplete, and biased to use directly. We propose to learn integrated representations, called EquiTensors, from heterogeneous datasets that can be reused across a variety of tasks. We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with \"oracle\"models that use hand-selected datasets. \u00a9 2021 ACM.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["exogenous features","accident risk","adaptive weighting","adversarial learning","align datasets","applications show","applications using","attribute race","biased data","called equitensors","certain datasets","combat discriminatory","consistent domain","convolutional denoising","core integrative","crowd mobility","data neural","data repositories","demand accident","denoising autoencoders","discriminatory bias","equitensors learning","equitensors outperform","fair integrations","help mitigate","heterogeneous datasets","heterogeneous urban","ignore exogenous","income experiments","information embodied","input datasets","integrated representations","integrating exogenous","integrative model","learn integrated","learn shared","learning fair","model performance","neural methods","noisy incomplete","open data","oracle models","outperform models","prediction problems","prevent certain","prices traffic","public safety","real applications","remove correlations","repositories weather","representations called","resource demand","risk crowd","safety model","sensitive attribute","sensitive information","shared representations","transportation resource","uncurated sources","unsupervised model","urban prediction","use adversarial","use datasets","use directly","using equitensors","weather housing","model based","housing prices","urban data"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["exogenous features","accident risk","adaptive weighting","adversarial learning","align datasets","applications show","applications using","attribute race","biased data","called equitensors","certain datasets","combat discriminatory","consistent domain","convolutional denoising","core integrative","crowd mobility","data neural","data repositories","demand accident","denoising autoencoders","discriminatory bias","equitensors learning","equitensors outperform","fair integrations","help mitigate","heterogeneous urban","housing prices","ignore exogenous","income experiments","information embodied","input datasets","integrated representations","integrating exogenous","integrative model","learn integrated","learn shared","learning fair","neural methods","noisy incomplete","open data","oracle models","outperform models","prediction problems","prevent certain","prices traffic","public safety","real applications","remove correlations","repositories weather","representations called","resource demand","risk crowd","safety model","sensitive attribute","sensitive information","shared representations","transportation resource","uncurated sources","unsupervised model","urban prediction","use adversarial","use directly","using equitensors","weather housing","heterogeneous datasets","model based","use datasets","model performance","urban data"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["exogenous features","accident risk","adaptive weighting","adversarial learning","align datasets","applications show","applications using","attribute race","biased data","called equitensors","certain datasets","combat discriminatory","consistent domain","convolutional denoising","core integrative","crowd mobility","data neural","data repositories","demand accident","denoising autoencoders","discriminatory bias","equitensors learning","equitensors outperform","fair integrations","help mitigate","heterogeneous datasets","heterogeneous urban","housing prices","ignore exogenous","income experiments","information embodied","input datasets","integrated representations","integrating exogenous","integrative model","learn integrated","learn shared","learning fair","model based","model performance","neural methods","noisy incomplete","open data","oracle models","outperform models","prediction problems","prevent certain","prices traffic","public safety","real applications","remove correlations","repositories weather","representations called","resource demand","risk crowd","safety model","sensitive attribute","sensitive information","shared representations","transportation resource","uncurated sources","unsupervised model","urban data","urban prediction","use adversarial","use datasets","use directly","using equitensors","weather housing"]},{"DocId":340,"Year":2021,"Title":"Do land policies make a difference? A data-driven approach to trace effects on urban form in France and Germany","Abstract":"Against the backdrop of rapidly expanding urban structures, land policies in many countries have been adapted to contain and redirect growth to existing urban structures. However, obstacles remain to measure the effects of policies. In the meantime, geoinformation technologies have given rise to a wide range of approaches to measure and describe urban form. Nevertheless, its application for the assessment of land policy has a high, but not yet fully exploited, potential. It is thus the aim of this research to address and investigate the options of spatial analysis and machine learning in particular to analyse urban form from a land policy perspective. To do so, we develop urban metrics informed by urban planning and land readjustment policies of two countries describing urban form on different spatial levels. We therefore formulate hypotheses on causal relations between policy and form. Based on the metrics, we apply the random forest algorithm to classify the building stock of the region. We then extract the residential areas, those with single-family houses, as this is where the effects of the policy are considered most visible. In a next step, we use random forest to predict the nationality of a building. Through variable importance measures, we identify and discuss urban morphological differences between the two countries and test the hypotheses on effects of land policies. We develop and test the approach for the French-German city-region of Strasbourg using OpenStreetMap data. We identify significant differences in the building coverage ratios, which tend to be higher in Germany. This can be linked to differences in planning regulations. Furthermore, German residential areas appear to be more diverse in urban form. Differences in land readjustment policies have proven to be plausible here, as French policies favour strong actors that develop residential areas more uniformly. In Germany, policies favour fragmented ownership-oriented development of residential areas. The metrics and the applied algorithm for building classification have proven to be robust in terms of data heterogeneity and have shown high levels of accuracy. They could also be successfully used for tracing causal relations. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban form","residential areas","land policies","causal relations","land policy","land readjustment","policies favour","readjustment policies","two countries","urban structures","random forest","analyse urban","applied algorithm","areas appear","building classification","building stock","countries describing","coverage ratios","data heterogeneity","describe urban","describing urban","develop residential","develop urban","difference approach","discuss urban","expanding urban","exploited potential","favour fragmented","favour strong","forest algorithm","form based","form differences","formulate hypotheses","fragmented development","french policies","fully exploited","geoinformation technologies","german residential","germany policies","given rise","identify significant","importance measures","make difference","meantime geoinformation","metrics informed","morphological differences","obstacles remain","openstreetmap data","planning regulations","policies make","policy perspective","rapidly expanding","redirect growth","shown high","significant differences","spatial levels","strasbourg using","strong actors","structures land","trace effects","tracing causal","urban morphological","using openstreetmap","variable importance","building coverage","different spatial","high levels","spatial analysis","urban metrics","use random","wide range","existing urban","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["residential areas","urban form","land policies","causal relations","land policy","land readjustment","policies favour","random forest","readjustment policies","two countries","urban structures","analyse urban","applied algorithm","areas appear","building classification","building coverage","building stock","countries describing","coverage ratios","data heterogeneity","describe urban","describing urban","develop residential","difference approach","different spatial","discuss urban","existing urban","expanding urban","exploited potential","favour fragmented","favour strong","forest algorithm","form based","form differences","formulate hypotheses","fragmented development","french policies","fully exploited","geoinformation technologies","german residential","germany policies","given rise","identify significant","importance measures","make difference","meantime geoinformation","metrics informed","morphological differences","obstacles remain","openstreetmap data","planning regulations","policies make","policy perspective","rapidly expanding","redirect growth","shown high","significant differences","spatial analysis","spatial levels","strasbourg using","strong actors","structures land","trace effects","tracing causal","urban morphological","use random","using openstreetmap","variable importance","wide range","develop urban","high levels","urban metrics","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban form","residential areas","land policies","causal relations","land policy","land readjustment","policies favour","random forest","readjustment policies","two countries","urban structures","analyse urban","applied algorithm","areas appear","building classification","building coverage","countries describing","coverage ratios","data heterogeneity","describe urban","describing urban","develop residential","develop urban","difference approach","different spatial","discuss urban","existing urban","expanding urban","exploited potential","favour fragmented","favour strong","forest algorithm","form based","form differences","formulate hypotheses","fragmented development","french policies","fully exploited","geoinformation technologies","german residential","germany policies","given rise","identify significant","importance measures","make difference","meantime geoinformation","metrics informed","morphological differences","obstacles remain","openstreetmap data","planning regulations","policies make","policy perspective","rapidly expanding","redirect growth","shown high","significant differences","spatial levels","strasbourg using","strong actors","structures land","trace effects","tracing causal","urban morphological","use random","using openstreetmap","variable importance","wide range","building stock","high levels","spatial analysis","urban metrics","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":341,"Year":2021,"Title":"Applying machine learning and geolocation techniques to social media data (Twitter) to develop a resource for urban planning","Abstract":"With all the recent attention focused on big data, it is easy to overlook that basic vital statistics remain difficult to obtain in most of the world. What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012-2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi.

Under the backdrop of global urbanization, some cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters that are influenced by unplanned urban expansion. Rational planning of urban functional areas needs to be strengthened to improve the scientific approach of urban planning and urbanization. In this study, the classification of urban functional areas based on dual-modal data (i.e., remote sensing image and user behavior data) was implemented using machine learning (ML) algorithms. After the set test, the classification accuracy of urban functional areas reached 82.45%. Through analysis, it could be concluded that the use of data of two modalities achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by using data of a single modality. The data of the two modalities complement each other, and the use of ML algorithms to train such data can yield good results. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["functional areas","urban functional","behavior data","ml algorithms","two modalities","user behavior","classification accuracy","achieved higher","areas based","areas needs","areas reached","challenges especially","data urbanization","expansion rational","global urbanization","good results","higher classification","modalities achieved","modalities complement","particularly vulnerable","rapid rate","rational planning","scientific approach","sensing image","set test","single modality","unplanned urban","using data","yield good","data remote","implemented using","remote sensing","natural disasters","climate change","learning ml","sensing images","using machine","urban planning","urban expansion","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["functional areas","urban functional","behavior data","ml algorithms","two modalities","user behavior","classification accuracy","remote sensing","achieved higher","areas based","areas needs","areas reached","challenges especially","climate change","data urbanization","expansion rational","global urbanization","good results","higher classification","modalities achieved","modalities complement","particularly vulnerable","rapid rate","rational planning","scientific approach","sensing image","sensing images","set test","single modality","unplanned urban","urban expansion","using data","yield good","urban planning","data remote","implemented using","learning ml","natural disasters","using machine","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["functional areas","urban functional","behavior data","ml algorithms","two modalities","user behavior","classification accuracy","remote sensing","achieved higher","areas based","areas needs","areas reached","challenges especially","climate change","data urbanization","expansion rational","global urbanization","good results","higher classification","modalities achieved","modalities complement","particularly vulnerable","rapid rate","rational planning","scientific approach","sensing image","sensing images","set test","single modality","unplanned urban","urban expansion","using data","yield good","urban planning","data remote","implemented using","learning ml","natural disasters","using machine","machine learning"]},{"DocId":343,"Year":2021,"Title":"Enabling digital co-creation in urban planning and development","Abstract":"Co-creation is essential for urban planning.

Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the \u2018forest\u2019 of data, and to miss the \u2018trees\u2019 of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole \u2018forest\u2019 of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Exploring the dynamics of urban greenness space and their driving forces can provide valuable information for making solid urban planning policies. This study aims to investigate the dynamics of urban greenness space patterns through landscape indices and to apply geographically weighted regression (GWR) to map the spatially varied impact on the indices from economic and environmental factors. Two typical landscape indices, i.e., percentage of landscape (PLAND) and aggregation index (AI), which measure the abundance and fragmentation of urban greenness coverage, respectively, were taken to map the changes in urban greenness. As a case study, the metropolis of Wuhan, China was selected, where time-series of urban greenness space were extracted at an annual step from the Landsat collections from Google Earth Engine during 2000\u20132018. The study shows that the urban greenness space not only decreased significantly, but also tended to be more fragmented over the years. Road network density, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), terrain elevation and slope, and precipitation were found to significantly correlate to the landscape indices. GWR modeling successfully captures the spatially varied impact from the considered factors and the results from GWR modeling provide a critical reference for making location-specific urban planning. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Finally, a street of 10 km length is chosen within the study area where a spatiotemporal street-level visual and auditory data is collected. Statistical analysis and Machine Learning modeling are performed in the surveyed dataset to predict the human perception of audio and visual scenes in the chosen street.

Many cities in these states show high growth dynamics, but little is known about the relation of conflicts and urban growth. In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime, which lasted from 1996 to 2001, caused large scale displacement of the population. People from Afghanistan migrated to neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan, and all developments came to a halt. After the US invasion in October 2001, all the major cities in Afghanistan experienced significant population growth, in particular, driven by the influx of internally displaced persons. Maximum pressure of this influx was felt by the capital city, Kabul. This rapid urbanization, combined with very limited capacity of local authorities to deal with this growth, led to unplanned urbanization and challenges for urban planning and management. This study analyses the patterns of growth between 2001 and 2017, and the factors influencing the growth in the city of Kabul with the help of high-resolution Earth Observation-based data (EO) and spatial logistic regression modelling. We analyze settlement patterns by extracting image features from high-resolution images (aerial photographs of 2017) and terrain features as input to a random forest classifier. The urban growth is analyzed using an available built-up map (extracted from IKONOS images for the year 2001). Results indicate that unplanned settlements have grown 4.5 times during this period, whereas planned settlements have grown only 1.25 times. The unplanned settlements expanded mostly towards the west and north west parts of the city, and the growth of planned settlements happened mainly in the central and eastern parts of the city. Population density and the locations of military bases are the most important factors that influence the growth, of both planned and unplanned settlements. The growth of unplanned settlement occurs predominantly in areas of steeper slopes on the hillside, while planned settlements are on gentle slopes and closer to the institutional areas (central and eastern parts of the city). We conclude that security and availability of infrastructure were the main drivers of growth for planned settlements, whereas unplanned growth, mainly on hillsides, was driven by the availability of land with poor infrastructure. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

secondary decomposition and sequence reconstruction","Abstract":"Acid rain is a serious threat to terrestrial ecosystems. To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction. In future work, the application of the proposed model in other air pollutants or other regions can be explored. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air pollutant","proposed model","acid rain","mode decomposition","pollutant prediction","prediction model","accurate early","adaptive noise","air pollutants","average improvement","combining secondary","comparison experiments","complete ensemble","concentration prediction","data preprocessing","data sets","decomposition algorithm","early warning","empirical mode","ensemble empirical","excellent prediction","experimental results","extreme learning","hybrid air","improve prediction","improvement levels","machine combined","model combining","new subsequences","novel air","optimization algorithm","original basis","planning novel","prevention urban","rain prevention","reconstruction acid","results three","sample entropy","secondary decomposition","sequence reconstruction","serious threat","sets according","terrestrial ecosystems","three main","travel planning","valuable reference","variational mode","warning information","whale optimization","effective method","empirical analysis","future work","learning machine","main conclusions","pollutant concentration","prediction performance","provide valuable","prediction accuracy","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air pollutant","proposed model","acid rain","mode decomposition","pollutant prediction","prediction model","accurate early","adaptive noise","air pollutants","average improvement","combining secondary","comparison experiments","complete ensemble","concentration prediction","data preprocessing","data sets","decomposition algorithm","early warning","empirical analysis","empirical mode","ensemble empirical","excellent prediction","experimental results","extreme learning","future work","hybrid air","improve prediction","improvement levels","machine combined","main conclusions","model combining","new subsequences","novel air","optimization algorithm","original basis","planning novel","prevention urban","rain prevention","reconstruction acid","results three","sample entropy","secondary decomposition","sequence reconstruction","serious threat","sets according","terrestrial ecosystems","three main","travel planning","valuable reference","variational mode","warning information","whale optimization","effective method","learning machine","pollutant concentration","prediction accuracy","prediction performance","provide valuable","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air pollutant","proposed model","acid rain","mode decomposition","pollutant prediction","prediction model","accurate early","adaptive noise","air pollutants","average improvement","combining secondary","comparison experiments","complete ensemble","concentration prediction","data preprocessing","data sets","decomposition algorithm","early warning","empirical analysis","empirical mode","ensemble empirical","excellent prediction","experimental results","extreme learning","future work","hybrid air","improve prediction","improvement levels","machine combined","main conclusions","model combining","new subsequences","novel air","optimization algorithm","original basis","planning novel","prediction accuracy","prevention urban","rain prevention","reconstruction acid","results three","sample entropy","secondary decomposition","sequence reconstruction","serious threat","sets according","terrestrial ecosystems","three main","travel planning","valuable reference","variational mode","warning information","whale optimization","effective method","learning machine","pollutant concentration","prediction performance","provide valuable","urban planning"]},{"DocId":349,"Year":2020,"Title":"Identifying tree traits for cooling urban heat islands\u2014a cross-city empirical analysis","Abstract":"Research Highlights: This paper presents a cross-city empirical study on micro-climatic thermal benefits of urban trees, using machine-learning analysis to identify the importance of several in situ measured tree physiognomy traits for cooling. Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

systems are geospatially colocated, forming a network of connections. This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity. These findings hold implications for urban planning and water distribution design to mitigate potential cascading failures. \u00a9 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["interface network","geospatial morphology","interface networks","network connectivity","water interface","geospatial colocation","nodal attributes","transportation systems","water distribution","network analysis","using network","analyzed using","average shortest","cascading failures","city interface","colocated forming","connectivity cluster","connectivity profile","connectivity responding","different cities","different geospatial","distribution design","eight cities","failure propagation","feature contributing","findings hold","forest model","forming network","forty interface","geospatially colocated","given city","given connectivity","given node","help understand","hold implications","interface connectivity","learning using","major nodal","minimize failure","mitigate potential","morphology water","multiple cities","network investigation","networks consist","nodal feature","node belongs","path length","potential cascading","predictive power","profile total","represent geospatial","shortest path","systems water","topological connectivity","topologically represent","urban geospatial","varying geospatial","results indicate","use random","random forest","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["interface network","geospatial morphology","interface networks","network connectivity","water interface","geospatial colocation","network analysis","nodal attributes","transportation systems","using network","water distribution","analyzed using","average shortest","cascading failures","city interface","colocated forming","connectivity cluster","connectivity profile","connectivity responding","different cities","different geospatial","distribution design","eight cities","failure propagation","feature contributing","findings hold","forest model","forming network","forty interface","geospatially colocated","given city","given connectivity","given node","help understand","hold implications","interface connectivity","learning using","major nodal","minimize failure","mitigate potential","morphology water","multiple cities","network investigation","networks consist","nodal feature","node belongs","path length","potential cascading","predictive power","profile total","represent geospatial","shortest path","systems water","topological connectivity","topologically represent","urban geospatial","use random","varying geospatial","results indicate","random forest","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["interface network","geospatial morphology","interface networks","network connectivity","water interface","geospatial colocation","network analysis","nodal attributes","transportation systems","using network","water distribution","analyzed using","average shortest","cascading failures","city interface","colocated forming","connectivity cluster","connectivity profile","connectivity responding","different cities","different geospatial","distribution design","eight cities","failure propagation","feature contributing","findings hold","forest model","forming network","forty interface","geospatially colocated","given city","given connectivity","given node","help understand","hold implications","interface connectivity","learning using","major nodal","minimize failure","mitigate potential","morphology water","multiple cities","network investigation","networks consist","nodal feature","node belongs","path length","potential cascading","predictive power","profile total","random forest","represent geospatial","results indicate","shortest path","systems water","topological connectivity","topologically represent","urban geospatial","use random","varying geospatial","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":351,"Year":2020,"Title":"Development of people mass movement simulation framework based on reinforcement learning","Abstract":"Understanding individual and crowd dynamics in urban environments is critical for numerous applications, such as urban planning, traffic forecasting, and location-based services.

In this study, we developed a reinforcement learning-based approach for modeling and simulation of people mass movement using the global positioning system (GPS) data.

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deep sequence","large cities","mobility data","urban area","absolute percentage","analyze mobility","area due","average error","baseline methods","city planning","consumption optimize","control air","day reducing","demand prediction","demanded areas","drivers incomes","energy consumption","error smape","evaluation metrics","external factors","given dataset","google maps","help companies","help service","highly demanded","incomes reduce","interest nowadays","interest pois","iot sensors","issues machine","lstm model","mean squared","method outperforms","mobility plays","mobility services","neighborhood locations","nowadays urban","optimize traffic","particular urban","passenger information","passengers thousands","percentage error","planning navigation","pois located","prediction using","public services","purpose points","raise drivers","reduce energy","sequence learning","sequence model","service providers","services taxicabs","sources given","squared error","symmetric mean","traffic efficiency","two evaluation","vacant vehicles","vanilla lstm","vital public","air pollution","data sources","error mse","important role","learning model","modern cities","pollution problems","smart city","taxi demand","taxi fleet","data acquired","learning techniques","mean absolute","proposed method","urban mobility","results show","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deep sequence","large cities","mobility data","urban area","absolute percentage","air pollution","analyze mobility","area due","average error","baseline methods","city planning","consumption optimize","control air","data acquired","day reducing","demand prediction","demanded areas","drivers incomes","energy consumption","error mse","error smape","external factors","given dataset","google maps","help companies","help service","highly demanded","important role","incomes reduce","interest nowadays","interest pois","iot sensors","issues machine","lstm model","mean absolute","mean squared","method outperforms","mobility plays","mobility services","modern cities","neighborhood locations","nowadays urban","optimize traffic","particular urban","passenger information","passengers thousands","percentage error","planning navigation","pois located","pollution problems","prediction using","public services","purpose points","raise drivers","reduce energy","sequence learning","sequence model","service providers","services taxicabs","sources given","squared error","symmetric mean","traffic efficiency","two evaluation","vacant vehicles","vanilla lstm","vital public","data sources","evaluation metrics","smart city","taxi demand","taxi fleet","proposed method","urban mobility","learning model","learning techniques","results show","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["deep sequence","large cities","mobility data","urban area","absolute percentage","air pollution","analyze mobility","area due","average error","baseline methods","city planning","consumption optimize","control air","data acquired","day reducing","demand prediction","demanded areas","drivers incomes","energy consumption","error mse","error smape","external factors","given dataset","google maps","help companies","help service","highly demanded","important role","incomes reduce","interest nowadays","interest pois","iot sensors","issues machine","lstm model","mean absolute","mean squared","method outperforms","mobility plays","mobility services","modern cities","neighborhood locations","nowadays urban","optimize traffic","particular urban","passenger information","passengers thousands","percentage error","planning navigation","pois located","pollution problems","prediction using","public services","purpose points","raise drivers","reduce energy","sequence learning","sequence model","service providers","services taxicabs","smart city","sources given","squared error","symmetric mean","traffic efficiency","two evaluation","vacant vehicles","vanilla lstm","vital public","data sources","evaluation metrics","proposed method","taxi demand","taxi fleet","urban mobility","learning model","learning techniques","results show","machine learning"]},{"DocId":353,"Year":2020,"Title":"Exploring the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership, using both inferential and machine learning approaches","Abstract":"Ride-sourcing services are getting more popular each year, and their markets are growing. Much has been speculated, but not much has been tested regarding the impacts of ride-sourcing services on the transportation system. In this study, we examine the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership of households, by using the most up-to-date (2017) national household travel survey data. To better capture the effect of ride-sourcing services on vehicle ownership, we controlled for the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of households and built environment variables, i.e., density, diversity, design, and distance to transit. Two approaches were used to model vehicle ownership: a probabilistic or inferential model (i.e., multilevel Poisson), and a machine learning method (i.e., random forest). This is the first study to utilize such advanced methods to model vehicle ownership and capture non-linear relationships, using the largest sample of household travel records ever assembled for such a study. The results suggest that there is a negative correlation between using ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership. Vehicle ownership is also negatively associated with the number of years Uber, as the biggest ride-sourcing service, has operated in a county. The relative contributions of ride-sourcing variables, however, are very limited compared to other variables controlled in this study which makes intuitive sense. For urban planning and design practices, this study suggests that the probability of car shedding will increase if the usage of ride-sourcing services becomes a habit, these services become more available, and built environments become more dense, connected, and transit-served. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["vehicle ownership","household travel","model vehicle","advanced methods","approaches services","becomes habit","better capture","biggest service","built environment","capture relationships","car shedding","dense connected","density diversity","design practices","diversity design","environment variables","environments become","inferential model","intuitive sense","largest sample","limited compared","makes intuitive","method random","model multilevel","multilevel poisson","national household","negative correlation","negatively associated","ownership probabilistic","ownership using","ownership vehicle","relationships using","relative contributions","results suggest","services become","services becomes","socioeconomic characteristics","study suggests","tested regarding","transit two","travel records","travel survey","two approaches","using services","variables controlled","variables density","years uber","built environments","learning approaches","survey data","transportation system","learning method","random forest","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["vehicle ownership","household travel","model vehicle","advanced methods","approaches services","becomes habit","better capture","biggest service","built environments","capture relationships","car shedding","dense connected","density diversity","design practices","diversity design","environment variables","environments become","inferential model","intuitive sense","largest sample","learning approaches","learning method","limited compared","makes intuitive","method random","model multilevel","multilevel poisson","national household","negative correlation","negatively associated","ownership probabilistic","ownership using","ownership vehicle","relationships using","relative contributions","services become","services becomes","socioeconomic characteristics","study suggests","survey data","tested regarding","transit two","travel records","travel survey","two approaches","using services","variables controlled","variables density","years uber","machine learning","built environment","results suggest","transportation system","random forest","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["vehicle ownership","household travel","model vehicle","advanced methods","approaches services","becomes habit","better capture","biggest service","built environments","capture relationships","car shedding","dense connected","density diversity","design practices","diversity design","environment variables","environments become","inferential model","intuitive sense","largest sample","learning approaches","learning method","limited compared","makes intuitive","method random","model multilevel","multilevel poisson","national household","negative correlation","negatively associated","ownership probabilistic","ownership using","ownership vehicle","relationships using","relative contributions","services become","services becomes","socioeconomic characteristics","study suggests","tested regarding","transit two","travel records","travel survey","two approaches","using services","variables controlled","variables density","years uber","machine learning","built environment","results suggest","survey data","transportation system","random forest","urban planning"]},{"DocId":354,"Year":2020,"Title":"Urban Experiment: Taking Off on the Wind of Al","Abstract":"Abstract.

In this paper, we investigate the nexus between station walkable catchments and forms of urbanity around transit nodes by adopting an assemblage approach to cut across any separation of sociality and spatiality. Drawing on empirical research from two case studies in Tehran, this paper contributes to studies on transit urban design by developing two measures of accessibility-the Catchment of Accessible Public Spaces (CAPS) and Accessible Interfaces (AI). We found that the combination of high CAPS and high AI within a given time can enable streetlife intensity, which is also linked to a synergistic effect of a larger assemblage, including the number of entries and diversity of functions. We argue that a focus on both measures is critical to understand the performance and potential transformation of street networks in a TOD. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["transit urban","urban design","accessible interfaces","accessible public","assemblage approach","assemblage including","design dimensions","developing two","developments tods","dimensions associated","emerging interest","empirical research","enable streetlife","given time","global north","global south","high ai","high caps","incipient stage","interfaces ai","international literature","larger assemblage","potential transformation","principles laid","south remains","space transit","spaces caps","spatiality drawing","station walkable","streetlife intensity","synergistic effect","tod principles","transit nodes","two case","two measures","walkable catchments","paper contributes","case studies","street networks","public space","public spaces"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban design","transit urban","accessible interfaces","accessible public","assemblage approach","assemblage including","design dimensions","developing two","developments tods","dimensions associated","emerging interest","empirical research","enable streetlife","given time","global north","global south","high ai","high caps","incipient stage","interfaces ai","international literature","larger assemblage","potential transformation","principles laid","south remains","space transit","spaces caps","spatiality drawing","station walkable","street networks","streetlife intensity","synergistic effect","tod principles","transit nodes","two case","two measures","walkable catchments","case studies","paper contributes","public space","public spaces"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban design","transit urban","accessible interfaces","accessible public","assemblage approach","assemblage including","design dimensions","developing two","developments tods","dimensions associated","emerging interest","empirical research","enable streetlife","given time","global north","global south","high ai","high caps","incipient stage","interfaces ai","international literature","larger assemblage","potential transformation","principles laid","south remains","space transit","spaces caps","spatiality drawing","station walkable","street networks","streetlife intensity","synergistic effect","tod principles","transit nodes","two case","two measures","walkable catchments","case studies","paper contributes","public space","public spaces"]},{"DocId":356,"Year":2020,"Title":"Evaluating multivariable statistical methods for downscaling nighttime land surface temperature in urban areas","Abstract":"For research and practice in fields such as the environment and meteorology, nighttime land surface temperature (LST) images at fine resolution provide important basic data. Since only a few satellite sensors can take fine-resolution thermal infrared images at night, such images are rather scarce. Downscaling of coarse-resolution LST images is a potential method for obtaining high-resolution LST images. However, downscaling methods have been mostly proposed for daytime LST images. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of methods that combine multiple explanatory variables and machine learning algorithms for downscaling coarse-resolution nighttime LST images in urban areas. Verification showed that the errors in the downscaling results were acceptable (mean absolute errors within 2 K). The resulting images could depict the spatial pattern of night LST in the study area in great detail. It was demonstrated that visible-near infrared images taken in the daytime could be used for downscaling of nighttime LST images, the rationality of which was deduced. It was also demonstrated that the performance of the spectral explanatory variables in nighttime LST downscalingwas not lower than that of the mechanism explanatory variables. This method has high application value in many academic and practical efforts, such as land-atmosphere interface radiation budget studies, suitability assessments of human settlement, and urban environmental planning. \u00a9 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Such signals cause major GNSS positioning (also known as \u201cNLOS multipath\u201d) errors. In this paper, a novel NLOS multipath detection technique using a machine-learning approach to improve the positioning accuracy in urban environments is proposed. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to a direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of an NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. To consider the change in shape of the correlation values of NLOS signals and their temporal variation, we propose a method for constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based NLOS discriminator. Furthermore, we propose a method for applying the NLOS probability, which is the output of the CNN, to the positioning calculation. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conducted NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We compared the proposed method with a method using a simple NN. As the experiment results indicate, the proposed method can correctly discriminate approximately 98% of NLOS multipath signals, and the discrimination rate of the proposed CNN-based method is higher than that of the simple NN-based approach. Furthermore, we improved the positioning accuracy from 34.1 to 1.6 m using the proposed method and concluded that the proposed approach can increase the positioning accuracy in urban environments. \u00a9 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

The existing techniques include the multi-sensor integration, 3D map aid, using a dual-polarized antenna, an omnidirectional camera aid are proposed to solve the classification problem. However, they all require external hardware or up-to-date map, which is expensive or impractical for mass-market applications. Consistency checking with the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is widely used for the detection of NLOS signals, but it is efficient only when the majority of the received signals are LOS signals. Machine learning methods, including the decision tree, the support vector machine (SVM) have been explored to classify LOS and NLOS with good accuracy. However, all current machine learning based method only utilize information within one epoch, all the inter-epoch information and data features in time series are lost, and the information of signal propagation in the complex urban environments is not fully manifested in the Rinex level observation and NMEA level observations in one single epoch. In this paper, a multivariate Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (MLSTM-FCN) based signal classification method is proposed. With the aid of the convolution layer and long short term memory block, this method handles the data features in both time domain and value domain. Six time series features of GNSS signal, including differenced C\/N0, time differenced ambiguity, double difference phase and pseudorange, phase and pseudorange consistency are analyzed and used as the input of the MLSTM-FCN. Datasets from two locations in the urban Calgary are collected, each of which is used for training and testing purposes respectively. The results reveal that, compared to the SVM classification method, the overall testing accuracy of the newly proposed classifier is improved from 93.00% to 95.97% for the Rinex level observation, and from 92.99% to 93.83 for the NMEA level observation. This improved classification accuracy brought by the proposed classifier is encouraging since it will enhance the robustness of the conventional GNSS positioning and the shadow matching based navigation system by reducing unbounded NLOS signal errors in urban environments and result in significant improvement in positioning accuracy. Compared to the SVM classifier aided single point positioning (SPP) test, the accuracy in the form of RMS of the MLSTM-FCN aided SPP test can be improved by 24.3%, 17.8% and 24.4% in the East, North and Up directions respectively, and the rate of the valid solution can be increased from 99.02% to 99.94%. The new method has the potential to be widely applied by various receiver types with the output of the raw observation or only with the NMEA observations output. \u00a9 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

By analyzing the optimized trained model, we tried to identify urban street vitality\u2019s visual features and evaluate their importance.

A total of 370 pictures and recorded score pairs from 231 valid survey sites were used to train a convolutional neural network. After optimization, a deep neural network model with 43 layers, including 11 convolutional ones, was created. Heat maps were then used to identify the features which lead to high vitality score outputs. The spatial distributions of different types of feature entities were also analyzed to help identify the spatial effects. The study found that visual features, including human, construction site, shop front, and roadside\/walking pavement, are vital ones that correspond to the vitality of the urban street. The consistency of these critical features with traditional urban vitality features indicates the model had learned useful knowledge from the training process.

is of great significance in precision agriculture, urban planning, land use and other fields. However, traditional remote sensing image classification methods cannot meet the classification accuracy requirements of UAV multi-spectral images. This paper aims to propose an object-based machine learning classification method to improve the land over classification accuracy of UAV multi-spectral images. The experimental area is a standard test field located in the Jilin Province of China. The experimental data was captured by a UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera which includes four bands from 550 nm to 790 nm. First, the original images were preprocessed and the spectral curves of land cover were analyzed, thus four kinds of land cover with large differences were selected as categories. Then pixel-based, boosting-based and object-based machine learning methods were used for classification. The object-based classification method could make full use of the spatial and spectral information, and eliminate the noise problem caused by the high resolution of the UAV image to a certain extent. Finally, accuracy analysis using the verification image showed that the RF-O method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 92.2419%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.8904. All results indicate that the object-based machine learning classification method proposed in this paper is more suitable for the research of land cover classification, comparing with the traditional remote sensing image classification methods, and performs well on the land cover classification of UAV multi-spectral images. \u00a9 2020 SPIE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["uav images","land cover","cover classification","classification method","learning classification","traditional remote","classification accuracy","using uav","sensing image","classification methods","machine learning","image classification","accuracy analysis","accuracy requirements","certain extent","classification based","classification comparing","experimental area","experimental data","extent finally","field located","finally accuracy","four bands","highest classification","image showed","includes four","jilin province","large differences","make full","noise problem","planning land","problem caused","spectral curves","spectral information","standard test","test field","uav equipped","uav image","verification image","agriculture urban","analysis using","four kinds","full use","great significance","images land","kappa coefficient","learning using","method proposed","original images","precision agriculture","method achieved","paper aims","classification using","learning methods","results indicate","remote sensing","land use","high resolution","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["uav images","cover classification","classification method","land cover","classification accuracy","sensing image","traditional remote","using uav","classification methods","learning classification","machine learning","image classification","accuracy analysis","accuracy requirements","agriculture urban","analysis using","certain extent","classification comparing","experimental area","experimental data","extent finally","field located","finally accuracy","four bands","four kinds","full use","great significance","highest classification","image showed","images land","includes four","jilin province","large differences","learning using","make full","method achieved","method proposed","noise problem","paper aims","planning land","precision agriculture","problem caused","results indicate","spectral curves","spectral information","standard test","test field","uav equipped","uav image","verification image","remote sensing","classification using","original images","classification based","kappa coefficient","learning methods","high resolution","land use","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["uav images","cover classification","classification method","land cover","classification accuracy","sensing image","traditional remote","using uav","classification methods","learning classification","machine learning","image classification","accuracy analysis","accuracy requirements","agriculture urban","analysis using","certain extent","classification comparing","experimental area","experimental data","extent finally","field located","finally accuracy","four bands","four kinds","full use","great significance","highest classification","image showed","images land","includes four","jilin province","large differences","learning using","make full","method achieved","method proposed","noise problem","paper aims","planning land","precision agriculture","problem caused","results indicate","spectral curves","spectral information","standard test","test field","uav equipped","uav image","verification image","classification using","high resolution","kappa coefficient","original images","remote sensing","classification based","learning methods","land use","urban planning"]},{"DocId":362,"Year":2020,"Title":"Support Vector Machine for Path Loss Predictions in Urban Environment","Abstract":"Path Loss (PL) propagation models are important for accurate radio network design and planning.

Therefore, an automatic road centerline extraction method based on the self-supervised learning framework for high-resolution remote sensing image is proposed. This proposed method does not need to manually select training samples and other optimization steps, such as the nonroad area removing. First, the positive sample selection method combining the spectral and shape features is proposed to extract the road sample. Then, the one-class classifier framework is introduced and the random forest positive unlabeled learning classifier is constructed to get the posterior probability of the pixel belonging to road. The shape feature and the posterior probability are combined to form the final road network in the object-oriented way. Finally, the road centerline is obtained through the tensor voting algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, high-resolution remote sensing images and benchmark datasets are used to do experiments. The indexes of the completeness ratio, the correctness ratio, and the detection quality are used for the quantitative accuracy evaluation. Compared with the supervised, the unsupervised, and the one-class classification road extraction algorithms, this proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy and efficiency. For the deep learning method comparison, the deep learning method performs well in most cases especially in the complex urban area. However, the deep learning method needs a large number of samples and a long training time, and our self-supervised learning framework does not need the training samples. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["learning method","road centerline","road extraction","learning framework","optimization steps","posterior probability","centerline extraction","proposed algorithm","sensing image","training samples","remote sensing","sensing images","deep learning","accuracy evaluation","achieves high","algorithm achieves","algorithm remote","area removing","automatic road","cases especially","classification road","classifier framework","completeness ratio","correctness ratio","detection quality","evaluation compared","existing road","extraction algorithms","final road","forest positive","images road","land planning","long training","manually select","method combining","method comparison","method needs","method performs","methods normally","needs large","nonroad area","pixel belonging","planning vehicle","positive sample","positive unlabeled","quantitative accuracy","road sample","sample selection","select training","selection method","shape feature","subsequent optimization","tensor voting","training time","unlabeled learning","voting algorithm","way finally","benchmark datasets","extraction method","extraction methods","method based","shape features","high accuracy","learning classifier","road network","complex urban","urban area","vehicle navigation","large number","random forest","proposed method"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["learning method","road centerline","road extraction","learning framework","optimization steps","posterior probability","centerline extraction","proposed algorithm","sensing image","training samples","remote sensing","sensing images","deep learning","accuracy evaluation","achieves high","algorithm achieves","algorithm remote","area removing","automatic road","cases especially","classification road","classifier framework","completeness ratio","correctness ratio","detection quality","evaluation compared","existing road","extraction algorithms","extraction method","final road","forest positive","images road","land planning","long training","manually select","method combining","method comparison","method needs","method performs","methods normally","needs large","nonroad area","pixel belonging","planning vehicle","positive sample","positive unlabeled","quantitative accuracy","road sample","sample selection","select training","selection method","shape feature","subsequent optimization","tensor voting","training time","unlabeled learning","voting algorithm","way finally","benchmark datasets","extraction methods","high accuracy","method based","shape features","learning classifier","road network","complex urban","urban area","vehicle navigation","large number","random forest","proposed method"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["learning method","road centerline","road extraction","learning framework","centerline extraction","optimization steps","posterior probability","proposed algorithm","sensing image","training samples","remote sensing","sensing images","deep learning","accuracy evaluation","achieves high","algorithm achieves","algorithm remote","area removing","automatic road","cases especially","classification road","classifier framework","completeness ratio","complex urban","correctness ratio","detection quality","evaluation compared","existing road","extraction algorithms","extraction method","final road","forest positive","high accuracy","images road","land planning","large number","learning classifier","long training","manually select","method based","method combining","method comparison","method needs","method performs","methods normally","needs large","nonroad area","pixel belonging","planning vehicle","positive sample","positive unlabeled","quantitative accuracy","road sample","sample selection","select training","selection method","shape feature","subsequent optimization","tensor voting","training time","unlabeled learning","urban area","voting algorithm","way finally","benchmark datasets","extraction methods","road network","shape features","vehicle navigation","random forest","proposed method"]},{"DocId":365,"Year":2020,"Title":"Uncertainties of human perception in visual image interpretation in complex urban environments","Abstract":"Today satellite images are mostly exploited automatically due to advances in image classification methods.

We focus on the agreement among interpreters and which aspects of perception and elements of image interpretation affect mapping. Ten test persons digitized six complex built-up areas. Hereby, we receive quantitative information about spatial variables of buildings to systematically check the consistency and congruence of results. An additional questionnaire reveals qualitative information about obstacles. Generally, we find large differences among interpreters' mapping results and a high consistency of results for the same interpreter. We measure rising deviations correlate with a rising morphologic complexity. High degrees of individuality are expressed e.g., in time consumption, in-situ- or geographic information system (GIS)-precognition whereas data source mostly influences the mapping procedure. By this study, we aim to fill a gap as prior research using MVII often does not implement an uncertainty analysis or quantify mapping aberrations. We conclude that remote sensing studies should not only rely unquestioned on MVII for validation; furthermore, data and methods are needed to suspend uncertainty. \u00a9 2008-2012

Automated recognition of buildings in image sources","Abstract":"Digital technologies provide novel ways of visualizing cities and buildings. They also facilitate new methods of analyzing the built environment, ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to crowdsourced citizen participation. Digital representations of cities have become so refined that they challenge our perception of the real. However, computers have not yet become able to detect and analyze the visible features of built structures depicted in photographs or other media. Recent scientific advances mean that it is possible for this new field of computer vision to serve as a critical aid to research. Neural networks now meet the challenge of identifying and analyzing building elements, buildings and urban landscapes. The development and refinement of these technologies requires more attention, simultaneously, investigation is needed in regard to the use and meaning of these methods for historical research. For example, the use of AI raises questions about the ways in which computer-based image recognition reproduces biases of contemporary practice. It also invites reflection on how mixed methods, integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches, can be established and used in research in the humanities. Finally, it opens new perspectives on the role of crowdsourcing in both knowledge dissemination and shared research. Attempts to analyze historical big data with the latest methods of deep learning, to involve many people\u2014laymen and experts\u2014in research via crowdsourcing and to deal with partly unknown visual material have provided a better understanding of what is possible.

Therefore, the security of the IoT system needs to be considered, this is related to data integrity, privacy, service stability. Through intrusion detection, activities on the IoT system will be able to be analyzed whether there are suspicious activities that can interfere with or threaten IoT services. In several previous studies in the literature, the approach used to detect intrusions in the IoT system has a high false alarm rate. This research proposes an approach through machine learning, specifically the ensemble learning approach and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) method as a method of detecting intrusions in the IoT system which is expected to produce better performance. The results of this study indicate that the proposed approach is able to detect intrusion and classify into five types of intrusion including normal intrusion, probe, dos, r2l, u2r. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed approach can improve the performance of intrusion detection in terms of accuracy to 97.02%, detection rate of 97%, false alarm rate 0.16%, compared to base learning and approaches in previous studies used as intrusion detection methods, but in processing time performance have not shown satisfying results. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["iot system","intrusion detection","alarm rate","ensemble learning","false alarm","previous studies","proposed approach","smote method","base learning","better performance","data integrity","detect intrusion","detect intrusions","detecting intrusions","detection activities","detection methods","detection rate","detection system","dos based","evaluation results","five types","health manufacturing","high false","including normal","integrity privacy","intrusion including","intrusion probe","iot infrastructure","iot services","learning specifically","manufacturing urban","minority technique","normal intrusion","planning housing","privacy service","probe dos","produce better","rate compared","research proposes","satisfying results","service stability","shown satisfying","study indicate","suspicious activities","synthetic minority","system needs","technique smote","threaten iot","time performance","using ensemble","industrial revolution","infrastructure using","learning approach","processing time","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["intrusion detection","iot system","alarm rate","ensemble learning","false alarm","previous studies","proposed approach","smote method","base learning","better performance","data integrity","detect intrusion","detect intrusions","detecting intrusions","detection activities","detection methods","detection rate","detection system","dos based","evaluation results","five types","health manufacturing","high false","including normal","industrial revolution","infrastructure using","integrity privacy","intrusion including","intrusion probe","iot infrastructure","iot services","learning specifically","manufacturing urban","minority technique","normal intrusion","planning housing","privacy service","probe dos","processing time","produce better","rate compared","research proposes","satisfying results","service stability","shown satisfying","study indicate","suspicious activities","synthetic minority","system needs","technique smote","threaten iot","time performance","using ensemble","learning approach","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["intrusion detection","iot system","alarm rate","ensemble learning","false alarm","previous studies","proposed approach","smote method","base learning","better performance","data integrity","detect intrusion","detect intrusions","detecting intrusions","detection activities","detection methods","detection rate","detection system","dos based","evaluation results","five types","health manufacturing","high false","including normal","industrial revolution","infrastructure using","integrity privacy","intrusion including","intrusion probe","iot infrastructure","iot services","learning specifically","manufacturing urban","minority technique","normal intrusion","planning housing","privacy service","probe dos","processing time","produce better","rate compared","research proposes","satisfying results","service stability","shown satisfying","study indicate","suspicious activities","synthetic minority","system needs","technique smote","threaten iot","time performance","using ensemble","learning approach","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":369,"Year":2019,"Title":"Combining design patterns and topic modeling to discover regions that support particular functionality","Abstract":"The problem of discovering regions that support particular functionalities in an urban setting has been approached in literature using two general methodologies: top-down, encoding expert knowledge on urban planning and design and discovering regions that conform to that knowledge; and bottom-up, using data to train machine learning models, which can discover similar regions. Both methodologies face limitations, with knowledge-based approaches being criticized for scalability and transferability issues and data-driven approaches for lacking interpretability and depending heavily on data quality. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework that fuses a knowledge-based approach using design patterns and a data-driven approach using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in three different ways: Functional regions discovered using either approach are evaluated against each other to identify cases of significant agreement or disagreement; knowledge from patterns is used to adjust topic probabilities in the learning model; and topic probabilities are used to adjust pattern-based results. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated through the use case of identifying shopping-related regions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results show that the combination of pattern-based discovery and topic modeling extraction helps uncover discrepancies between the two approaches and smooth inaccuracies caused by the limitations of each approach. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["topic modeling","design patterns","discovering regions","support particular","topic probabilities","approach using","adjust results","adjust topic","angeles metropolitan","area results","combining design","data quality","depending heavily","different ways","disagreement knowledge","discover regions","discover similar","discovered using","encoding expert","expert knowledge","extraction helps","face limitations","fuses approach","general methodologies","helps uncover","identify cases","identifying regions","inaccuracies caused","lacking interpretability","lda topic","los angeles","methodologies encoding","methodologies face","metropolitan area","modeling extraction","particular functionalities","particular functionality","propose novel","proposed methodologies","regions discovered","significant agreement","similar regions","smooth inaccuracies","transferability issues","two approaches","two general","uncover discrepancies","urban setting","use case","using design","using two","ways functional","literature using","novel framework","three different","train machine","using latent","allocation lda","functional regions","using data","learning model","dirichlet allocation","latent dirichlet","learning models","results show","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["topic modeling","approach using","design patterns","discovering regions","support particular","topic probabilities","adjust results","adjust topic","angeles metropolitan","area results","combining design","data quality","depending heavily","different ways","disagreement knowledge","discover regions","discover similar","discovered using","encoding expert","expert knowledge","extraction helps","face limitations","fuses approach","general methodologies","helps uncover","identify cases","identifying regions","inaccuracies caused","lacking interpretability","lda topic","learning model","learning models","literature using","los angeles","methodologies encoding","methodologies face","metropolitan area","modeling extraction","novel framework","particular functionalities","particular functionality","propose novel","proposed methodologies","regions discovered","significant agreement","similar regions","smooth inaccuracies","three different","train machine","transferability issues","two approaches","two general","uncover discrepancies","urban setting","use case","using data","using design","using two","ways functional","allocation lda","functional regions","results show","using latent","dirichlet allocation","latent dirichlet","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["topic modeling","approach using","design patterns","discovering regions","support particular","topic probabilities","adjust results","adjust topic","angeles metropolitan","area results","combining design","data quality","depending heavily","different ways","disagreement knowledge","discover regions","discover similar","discovered using","encoding expert","expert knowledge","extraction helps","face limitations","fuses approach","general methodologies","helps uncover","identify cases","identifying regions","inaccuracies caused","lacking interpretability","lda topic","learning model","los angeles","methodologies encoding","methodologies face","metropolitan area","modeling extraction","novel framework","particular functionalities","particular functionality","propose novel","proposed methodologies","regions discovered","significant agreement","similar regions","smooth inaccuracies","three different","train machine","transferability issues","two approaches","two general","uncover discrepancies","urban setting","use case","using design","using two","ways functional","learning models","literature using","results show","using data","using latent","allocation lda","dirichlet allocation","functional regions","latent dirichlet","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":370,"Year":2019,"Title":"Crowdsensed Data Learning-Driven Prediction of Local Businesses Attractiveness in Smart Cities","Abstract":"Urban planning typically relies on experience-based solutions and traditional methodologies to face urbanization issues and investigate the complex dynamics of cities.

To overcome this, we proposed a comprehensive approach to achieve fine-grained dynamic population distribution and high-resolution population map based on large-scale sparse mobile phone data. First, we developed an anchor-point-based trajectory reconstruction method to improve the spatiotemporal granularity of mobile phone trajectories. Then, a rapid and efficient automation population mapping method was proposed with the support of reconstructed high spatiotemporal resolution of human movements. Finally, we analyze spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution and spatial-Temporal interaction of human movement. Using a real mobile phone dataset in the city of Shanghai as a case study, we evaluated the performance of our method. Results indicated that our method improved the precision and reliability of population distribution estimation and could be utilized for quantitatively analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution and migration.

Based on the available massive geo-located human data, existing studies focused almost exclusively on the position attributes (i.e. coordinates) of the locations visited by people to explore the relationship, however, they ignored the category attributes (e.g. restaurant or supermarket) of these locations which imply the purposes (e.g. eating or shopping) behind human movements. A location with coordinates and category information is usually referred to as a point-of-interest (POI). In this paper, we study the relationship between POIs-related human mobility and socioeconomic status at city level. Starting from the location-based social network (i.e. Foursquare) dataset, we find that the check-in numbers of location categories are correlated with socioeconomic indicators, either positively or negatively. To further validate these correlations, we develop and test a multi-task prediction framework based on POIs-related human mobility for forecasting socioeconomic indicators. Extensive experiments on the Foursquare dataset show that the socioeconomic indicators can be well predicted by our proposed framework. Our findings and methods are helpful for modeling human mobility and assessing socioeconomic status. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["socioeconomic status","human mobility","socioeconomic indicators","foursquare dataset","assessing socioeconomic","attributes coordinates","attributes restaurant","available massive","category attributes","category information","city level","data existing","dataset show","extensive experiments","forecasting socioeconomic","formulation urban","human data","human movements","indicators extensive","level starting","location categories","locations visited","marketing strategies","massive human","modeling human","movements location","network foursquare","policies formulation","position attributes","prediction framework","public policies","purposes eating","region understanding","strategies development","studies focused","test prediction","usually referred","development based","framework based","existing studies","urban design","social network","proposed framework"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["human mobility","socioeconomic status","socioeconomic indicators","foursquare dataset","assessing socioeconomic","attributes coordinates","attributes restaurant","available massive","category attributes","category information","city level","data existing","dataset show","development based","extensive experiments","forecasting socioeconomic","formulation urban","framework based","human data","human movements","indicators extensive","level starting","location categories","locations visited","marketing strategies","massive human","modeling human","movements location","network foursquare","policies formulation","position attributes","prediction framework","proposed framework","public policies","purposes eating","region understanding","social network","strategies development","studies focused","test prediction","urban design","usually referred","existing studies"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["socioeconomic status","human mobility","socioeconomic indicators","foursquare dataset","assessing socioeconomic","attributes coordinates","attributes restaurant","available massive","category attributes","category information","city level","data existing","dataset show","development based","extensive experiments","forecasting socioeconomic","formulation urban","framework based","human data","human movements","indicators extensive","level starting","location categories","locations visited","marketing strategies","massive human","modeling human","movements location","network foursquare","policies formulation","position attributes","prediction framework","public policies","purposes eating","region understanding","social network","strategies development","studies focused","test prediction","usually referred","existing studies","urban design","proposed framework"]},{"DocId":373,"Year":2019,"Title":"Mining heterogeneous urban data for retail store placement","Abstract":"Retail store placement problem has been extensively studied in both academic and industry as it decides the retail success of a business.

To define regions, most existing studies use fixed grids or pre-defined administrative boundaries (e.g., census tracts or community areas). In reality, however, definitions of regions should be different depending on tasks (e.g., regional crime count prediction vs. real estate prices estimation). In this paper, we propose a new problem of task-specific city region partitioning, aiming to find the best partition in a city w.r.t. a given task. We prove this is an NP-hard search problem with no trivial solution. To learn the partition, we first study two variants of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We further propose a reinforcement learning scheme for effective sampling the search space. We conduct experiments on two real datasets in Chicago (i.e., crime count and real estate price) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. \u00a9 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["crime count","city region","real estate","accessible urban","administrative boundaries","best partition","boundaries census","build model","carlo mcmc","census tracts","chain monte","chicago crime","city given","community areas","conduct experiments","count prediction","data provide","data sample","define regions","different depending","effective sampling","estate price","features demographics","fixed grids","given task","learning city","learning scheme","markov chain","monte carlo","new insights","new problem","partitioning aiming","prediction real","prices estimation","propose reinforcement","region partition","region partitioning","regional crime","reinforcement learning","search problem","search space","studies use","study two","target variable","tasks frequently","tasks regional","trivial solution","two real","two variants","urban tasks","use fixed","variable crime","estate prices","propose new","provide new","publicly accessible","real datasets","urban features","various urban","existing studies","proposed method","urban data"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["crime count","city region","real estate","accessible urban","administrative boundaries","best partition","boundaries census","build model","carlo mcmc","census tracts","chain monte","chicago crime","city given","community areas","conduct experiments","count prediction","data provide","data sample","define regions","different depending","effective sampling","estate price","estate prices","features demographics","fixed grids","given task","learning city","learning scheme","markov chain","monte carlo","new insights","new problem","partitioning aiming","prediction real","prices estimation","propose new","propose reinforcement","proposed method","provide new","publicly accessible","real datasets","region partition","region partitioning","regional crime","reinforcement learning","search problem","search space","studies use","study two","target variable","tasks frequently","tasks regional","trivial solution","two real","two variants","urban features","urban tasks","use fixed","variable crime","various urban","existing studies","urban data"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["crime count","city region","real estate","accessible urban","administrative boundaries","best partition","boundaries census","build model","carlo mcmc","census tracts","chain monte","chicago crime","city given","community areas","conduct experiments","count prediction","data provide","data sample","define regions","different depending","effective sampling","estate price","estate prices","existing studies","features demographics","fixed grids","given task","learning city","learning scheme","markov chain","monte carlo","new insights","new problem","partitioning aiming","prediction real","prices estimation","propose new","propose reinforcement","proposed method","provide new","publicly accessible","region partition","region partitioning","regional crime","reinforcement learning","search problem","search space","studies use","study two","target variable","tasks frequently","tasks regional","trivial solution","two real","two variants","urban features","urban tasks","use fixed","variable crime","various urban","real datasets","urban data"]},{"DocId":375,"Year":2019,"Title":"City safety perception model based on visual content of street images","Abstract":"Safety perception measurement has been a subject of interest in many cities of the world. This is due to its social relevance, and to its effect on some local economic activities. Even though people safety perception is a subjective topic, sometimes it is possible to find out common beliefs given a restricted sociocultural context. This paper presents an approach that makes use of image processing and machine learning techniques to model citizen's safety perception using visual information of city images. The proposed method predicts how safe a given street of Bogot\u00e1 City can be. This is done based on people judgment of the visual appearance of a street image. Results suggest that the obtained model is able to detect city streets, where a visual feature is linked to an activity or street condition that has a significant influence on their associated safety perception. This feature makes the proposed model an alternative tool for decision makers with regard to urban planning, safety and health public policies, as well as a collective memory associated to a particular urban environment. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["safety perception","alternative tool","associated safety","beliefs given","bogot\u00e1 city","citizen safety","city images","city safety","city streets","collective memory","common beliefs","detect city","economic activities","feature makes","given restricted","given street","health public","image processing","image results","images safety","local economic","makes use","memory associated","method predicts","model citizen","obtained model","particular urban","people judgment","people safety","perception measurement","perception model","perception using","planning safety","public policies","restricted sociocultural","results suggest","safe given","significant influence","social relevance","sociocultural context","street condition","street images","subjective topic","using visual","visual appearance","visual content","visual feature","visual information","decision makers","model based","paper presents","proposed model","street image","proposed method","learning techniques","urban environment","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["safety perception","alternative tool","associated safety","beliefs given","bogot\u00e1 city","citizen safety","city images","city safety","city streets","collective memory","common beliefs","decision makers","detect city","economic activities","feature makes","given restricted","given street","health public","image processing","image results","images safety","local economic","makes use","memory associated","method predicts","model based","model citizen","obtained model","paper presents","particular urban","people judgment","people safety","perception measurement","perception model","perception using","planning safety","proposed model","public policies","restricted sociocultural","results suggest","safe given","significant influence","social relevance","sociocultural context","street condition","street image","street images","subjective topic","using visual","visual appearance","visual content","visual feature","visual information","proposed method","urban environment","learning techniques","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["safety perception","alternative tool","associated safety","beliefs given","bogot\u00e1 city","citizen safety","city images","city safety","city streets","collective memory","common beliefs","decision makers","detect city","economic activities","feature makes","given restricted","given street","health public","image processing","image results","images safety","local economic","makes use","memory associated","method predicts","model based","model citizen","obtained model","paper presents","particular urban","people judgment","people safety","perception measurement","perception model","perception using","planning safety","public policies","restricted sociocultural","results suggest","safe given","significant influence","social relevance","sociocultural context","street condition","street image","street images","subjective topic","using visual","visual appearance","visual content","visual feature","visual information","proposed model","urban environment","learning techniques","proposed method","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":376,"Year":2019,"Title":"Accessibility: Operationalizing a concept with relevance for planners","Abstract":"Earlier chapters in this book have shown that whilst accessibility is a well-studied concept in the scientific literature its use in practice is still limited. In this chapter, we examine 24 of the latest wave of Accessibility Instruments (AIs) represented in COST Action TU1002 to assess their potential usability as planning support tools for transport and land use practitioners. We here describe their key features (background, conceptual framework, and theoretical underpinnings, operational aspects, relevance for planning practice, strengths and limitations, and visualization) in some detail and we reflect in a more nuanced way, as urban planners, on the data collected thought a survey, on how these instruments can most usefully be deployed to address land use and transport planning issues. We also describe the developer\u2019s perception of usability collected through the same survey used for collecting the key features. We identify, per item, significant similarities and differences and reflect on potential implications for their usability in planning practice. Besides the Accessibility Instruments Survey, this chapter also uses data also from the AIs summary reports, which provide much richer information and explanation than the developer\u2019s survey of how they anticipate their instruments could have a role in urban planning. The chapter is structured into six sections. The first section provides an overview of the background of the 24 AIs involved in this research, followed by a description of the role in urban and transport planning of the AIs. The third section concludes the debate around the key features of the 24 AIs going into detail on conceptual and operational issues, such as the conceptual framework and theoretical underpinnings, the operational characteristics, and the visualization of outputs. The fourth section provides a specific analysis of the developer\u2019s perception of usability of their AIs. This is followed by a more general debate on the relevance of AIs for planning practice.

In this context, we can easily observe the whole earth from its different sides. Therefore, this big data is important in remote sensing and could be exploited in several domains requiring image classification, natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, agriculture, urban planning. Over the last five years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) emerged as the most successful technique for the image classification task, as well as a number of other computer vision tasks. However, to train millions of parameters in CNN one requires a huge amount of annotated data. This requirement leads to a significant challenge if the available training data is limited for a target task at hand. To address this challenge, in the recent literature, researchers proposed various ways to apply a technique called Transfer Learning to transfer the knowledge gained by training CNNs parameters on some large annotated dataset to the target task with limited availability of training data. Most of our work in this paper was dedicated to proposing a hybrid classification of remote sensing images.

Finding repeating dynamical patterns is important in understanding freight behaviors, and aids freight-friendly planning. In the digital age, data on truck drivers is becoming more available with heterogeneous demographic and work profiles. By synthesizing such pervasive data and applying machine learning concepts, this paper proposes to identify signature travel activity patterns via dimensionality reduction. Based on driver survey data, truck drivers\u2019 behaviors are represented as longitudinal activity sequences. Dimensionality reduction and activity reconstruction via principal components analysis (PCA), logistic PCA, and autoencoder were conducted to reveal fundamental activity features and approximate the underlying data-generating function. In the driver survey dataset, 243 truck drivers in Singapore reported their daily activities for 1,099 weekdays. This study found that PCA produced the most faithful reconstruction of drivers\u2019 activities. When projecting the input data down from 2,592 to 82 dimensions, PCA explained 77% of variances with a reconstruction error of 0.99%. Logistic PCA is a useful extension of PCA to study the pattern of a single activity. It captures the variation of infrequent activities such as truck queuing, which PCA fails to reconstruct. Autoencoder was found to be more powerful than PCA in reconstructing activities \u2013 with 1% of original dimensions, it reconstructed the activities with an error rate of 1.24%. Moreover, when implemented as a variational autoencoder, autoencoder generated realistic-looking samples of driver activities. The top three most distinctive activity patterns of Singapore truck drivers are reported using PCA. \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["truck drivers","activity patterns","dimensionality reduction","driver survey","logistic pca","activity features","activity profiles","activity reconstruction","activity sequences","age data","aids planning","analysis pca","applying machine","areas finding","autoencoder autoencoder","autoencoder generated","components analysis","daily activities","data truck","dataset truck","digital age","dimensions pca","distinctive activity","driver activities","driver activity","drivers activities","drivers behaviors","dynamical patterns","error rate","faithful reconstruction","finding repeating","freight behaviors","fundamental activity","generated samples","heterogeneous demographic","identify signature","infrequent activities","input data","learning concepts","longitudinal activity","original dimensions","paper studies","pca explained","pca fails","pca logistic","pca produced","pervasive data","principal components","reconstruct autoencoder","reconstructing activities","reconstruction error","reduction based","repeating dynamical","reported using","reveal fundamental","reveal urban","sequences dimensionality","signature travel","singapore reported","singapore truck","single activity","study found","survey dataset","travel activity","truck driver","truck queuing","underlying function","understanding freight","urban truck","useful extension","using pca","variational autoencoder","work profiles","survey data","paper proposes","urban areas","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["truck drivers","activity patterns","dimensionality reduction","driver survey","logistic pca","activity features","activity profiles","activity reconstruction","activity sequences","age data","aids planning","applying machine","areas finding","autoencoder autoencoder","autoencoder generated","components analysis","daily activities","data truck","dataset truck","digital age","dimensions pca","distinctive activity","driver activities","driver activity","drivers activities","drivers behaviors","dynamical patterns","error rate","faithful reconstruction","finding repeating","freight behaviors","fundamental activity","generated samples","heterogeneous demographic","identify signature","infrequent activities","input data","learning concepts","longitudinal activity","original dimensions","paper studies","pca explained","pca fails","pca logistic","pca produced","pervasive data","principal components","reconstruct autoencoder","reconstructing activities","reconstruction error","reduction based","repeating dynamical","reported using","reveal fundamental","reveal urban","sequences dimensionality","signature travel","singapore reported","singapore truck","single activity","study found","survey dataset","travel activity","truck driver","truck queuing","underlying function","understanding freight","urban truck","useful extension","using pca","variational autoencoder","work profiles","analysis pca","paper proposes","survey data","urban areas","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["truck drivers","activity patterns","dimensionality reduction","driver survey","logistic pca","activity features","activity profiles","activity reconstruction","activity sequences","age data","aids planning","analysis pca","applying machine","areas finding","autoencoder autoencoder","autoencoder generated","components analysis","daily activities","data truck","dataset truck","digital age","dimensions pca","distinctive activity","driver activities","driver activity","drivers activities","drivers behaviors","dynamical patterns","error rate","faithful reconstruction","finding repeating","freight behaviors","fundamental activity","generated samples","heterogeneous demographic","identify signature","infrequent activities","input data","learning concepts","longitudinal activity","original dimensions","paper proposes","paper studies","pca explained","pca fails","pca logistic","pca produced","pervasive data","principal components","reconstruct autoencoder","reconstructing activities","reconstruction error","reduction based","repeating dynamical","reported using","reveal fundamental","reveal urban","sequences dimensionality","signature travel","singapore reported","singapore truck","single activity","study found","survey dataset","travel activity","truck driver","truck queuing","underlying function","understanding freight","urban areas","urban truck","useful extension","using pca","variational autoencoder","work profiles","survey data","machine learning"]},{"DocId":382,"Year":2018,"Title":"Application of machine learning in urban greenery land cover extraction","Abstract":"Urban greenery is a critical part of the modern city and the greenery coverage information is essential for land resource management, environmental monitoring and urban planning. It is a challenging work to extract the urban greenery information from remote sensing image as the trees and grassland are mixed with city built-ups. In this paper, we propose a new automatic pixel-based greenery extraction method using multispectral remote sensing images. The method includes three main steps. First, a small part of the images is manually interpreted to provide prior knowledge. Secondly, a five-layer neural network is trained and optimised with the manual extraction results, which are divided to serve as training samples, verification samples and testing samples. Lastly, the well-trained neural network will be applied to the unlabelled data to perform the greenery extraction. The GF-2 and GJ-1 high resolution multispectral remote sensing images were used to extract greenery coverage information in the built-up areas of city X. It shows a favourable performance in the 619 square kilometers areas.

In order to realize accurate and fast building detection, a non-interactive approach based on binary feature classification is brought forward in this paper. The proposed approach includes two major stages, i.e., building area detection and building contours extraction. In the first stage, a sequence of intersections is obtained by superpixel segmentation in the subsampled orthophoto, and then building area is reserved roughly according to the classification of intersections. In the second stage, the sequence of intersections is updated by superpixel segmentation in the building area from original orthophoto, and then building contours is extracted in accordance with the classification of intersections likewise. The local feature of the intersections is descripted employing our extremely compact binary descriptor, and is classified using binary bag-of-features. Experiments show that benefiting from binary description and making full use of texture details and color channels, the proposed descriptor is not only computationally frugal, but also accurate. Experiments are also conducted on orthophotos with different roof colors, textures, shapes, sizes and orientations, and demonstrate that the proposed approach are capable of achieving desirable results. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building area","building detection","binary feature","building contours","feature classification","superpixel segmentation","using binary","proposed approach","accurate experiments","achieving desirable","approach includes","area detection","binary description","binary descriptor","binary experiments","brought forward","classification building","color channels","colors textures","compact binary","computationally frugal","contours extraction","descripted employing","desirable results","detection approach","different roof","extremely compact","fast building","includes two","intersections likewise","local feature","major stages","making full","original orthophoto","proposed descriptor","realize accurate","reserved roughly","roof colors","roughly according","shapes sizes","stage sequence","stages building","subsampled orthophoto","texture details","textures shapes","full use","orthophotos using","two major","classified using","various applications","approach based","experiments show","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building area","building detection","binary feature","building contours","feature classification","superpixel segmentation","using binary","proposed approach","accurate experiments","achieving desirable","approach includes","area detection","binary description","binary descriptor","binary experiments","brought forward","classification building","color channels","colors textures","compact binary","computationally frugal","contours extraction","descripted employing","desirable results","detection approach","different roof","extremely compact","fast building","full use","includes two","intersections likewise","local feature","major stages","making full","original orthophoto","proposed descriptor","realize accurate","reserved roughly","roof colors","roughly according","shapes sizes","stage sequence","stages building","subsampled orthophoto","texture details","textures shapes","classified using","orthophotos using","two major","various applications","approach based","experiments show","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building area","binary feature","building contours","feature classification","superpixel segmentation","using binary","building detection","proposed approach","accurate experiments","achieving desirable","approach based","approach includes","area detection","binary description","binary descriptor","binary experiments","brought forward","classification building","classified using","color channels","colors textures","compact binary","computationally frugal","contours extraction","descripted employing","desirable results","detection approach","different roof","extremely compact","fast building","full use","includes two","intersections likewise","local feature","major stages","making full","original orthophoto","proposed descriptor","realize accurate","reserved roughly","roof colors","roughly according","shapes sizes","stage sequence","stages building","subsampled orthophoto","texture details","textures shapes","various applications","orthophotos using","two major","experiments show","urban planning"]},{"DocId":386,"Year":2018,"Title":"Machine learning for real-time urban metrics and design recommendations","Abstract":"Cities are growing, becoming more complex, and changing rapidly. Currently, community engagement for urban decision-making is often ineffective, uninformed, and only occurs in projects\u2019 later stages. To facilitate a more collaborative and evidence-based urban decision-making process for both experts and non-experts, real-time feedback and optimized suggestions are essential. However, most of the current tools for urban planning are neither capable of performing complex simulations in real-time nor of providing guidance for better urban performance. CityMatrix was introduced to address these challenges. Machine learning techniques were applied to achieve real-time prediction of multiple urban simulations, and thousands of city configurations were simulated. The simulation results were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the traffic and solar performance of unseen city configurations. The prediction with the CNN is thousands of times faster than the original simulations and maintains a high-quality representation of the results. This machine learning approach was applied as a versatile, quick, accurate, and computationally efficient method not only for real-time feedback, but also for optimized design recommendations. Users involved in the evaluation of this project had a better understanding of the embodied trade-offs of the city and achieved their goals in an efficient manner. \u00a9 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

We have further developed a person detection method and introduced a person tracker as an intermediate stage between person detection and anomaly detection. The method is presented together with results from evaluations based on real sensor data that have been recorded in a realistic urban environment. Several scenarios have been recorded such as normal situations, a person loitering, a person shooting and people escaping from sudden smoke development. The method uses sensor data from a static video surveillance system, consisting of two visual and two thermal infrared cameras. The person detection method combines foreground segmentation with a trained machine learning algorithm which is based on boosting. The tracker associates incoming detections to objects (i.e. people), and generates tracks of world coordinates and velocities of objects. The anomaly detection method, which is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), fuses information that is derived from the tracker. The information contains a number of persons, their positions and velocities. The results indicate that the person detection method in combination with the tracker can produce robust and accurate observations to the HMM, which in turn provide good conditions for accurate anomaly detection. \u00a9 2018 SPIE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["anomaly detection","detection method","person detection","sensor data","urban environments","abnormal behaviors","accurate anomaly","accurate observations","associates incoming","behaviors related","camera network","combines foreground","contains number","developed person","evaluations based","foreground segmentation","fuses information","generates tracks","good conditions","hidden markov","hmm fuses","incoming detections","information contains","information fusion","infrared cameras","intermediate stage","introduced person","loitering person","markov model","method combines","method uses","model hmm","normal situations","objects people","people escaping","person loitering","person shooting","person tracker","presents method","produce robust","provide good","real sensor","robust anomaly","situations person","smoke development","static video","sudden smoke","surveillance system","system consisting","thermal infrared","tracker associates","trained machine","turn provide","two thermal","two visual","uses sensor","using sensor","video surveillance","violent events","world coordinates","environments using","realistic urban","results indicate","paper presents","learning algorithm","urban environment","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["anomaly detection","detection method","person detection","sensor data","urban environments","abnormal behaviors","accurate anomaly","accurate observations","associates incoming","behaviors related","camera network","combines foreground","contains number","developed person","environments using","evaluations based","foreground segmentation","fuses information","generates tracks","good conditions","hidden markov","hmm fuses","incoming detections","information contains","information fusion","infrared cameras","intermediate stage","introduced person","loitering person","markov model","method combines","method uses","model hmm","normal situations","objects people","paper presents","people escaping","person loitering","person shooting","person tracker","presents method","produce robust","provide good","real sensor","realistic urban","results indicate","robust anomaly","situations person","smoke development","static video","sudden smoke","surveillance system","system consisting","thermal infrared","tracker associates","trained machine","turn provide","two thermal","two visual","uses sensor","using sensor","video surveillance","violent events","world coordinates","learning algorithm","urban environment","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["anomaly detection","detection method","person detection","sensor data","urban environments","abnormal behaviors","accurate anomaly","accurate observations","associates incoming","behaviors related","camera network","combines foreground","contains number","developed person","environments using","evaluations based","foreground segmentation","fuses information","generates tracks","good conditions","hidden markov","hmm fuses","incoming detections","information contains","information fusion","infrared cameras","intermediate stage","introduced person","learning algorithm","loitering person","markov model","method combines","method uses","model hmm","normal situations","objects people","paper presents","people escaping","person loitering","person shooting","person tracker","presents method","produce robust","provide good","real sensor","realistic urban","results indicate","robust anomaly","situations person","smoke development","static video","sudden smoke","surveillance system","system consisting","thermal infrared","tracker associates","trained machine","turn provide","two thermal","two visual","urban environment","uses sensor","using sensor","video surveillance","violent events","world coordinates","machine learning"]},{"DocId":388,"Year":2018,"Title":"Data mining techniques for smart mobility\u2014a survey","Abstract":"With the rapid increase in urbanization, there is essence for making urban areas smart.

There are two major types of data such as top-down and bottom-up data. Interestingly, there is a third category of data that has not been widely deployed yet which we define as the 'Holistic visual data'. It is the general impression to your visual perception of urban environment when you at a specific spot that we believe can be captured by Google Street Views. This paper aims to ask how do top-down, bottomup, and holistic visual data work individually or together to predict the built environment value in urban areas. Admittedly, housing price is a highly spatial metric that involves multifarious interests including macroeconomic policies, the development of the area, the local people, and specific houses' features. To investigate the quality of built environment, machine learning techniques are adopted for different groups of datasets. By comparing several regression and classification models for each groups of data such as top-down, bottom-up and holistic visual data with housing price, the Random Forest model could be proposed as a best model. The intricate urban matrix needs to be organized such an order, but there are multiple factors affecting urban issues including land values and housing prices.

urbanizations, such as the residential, entertainment or hospital districts, which can be indicated during the urban planning. Recently, researchers try to discover the region functions with the human mobility data based on machine learning and statistical models. However, previous work always employs the single domain data like mobility information or district attributes to measure the functions. In this paper, we will address the problem by integrating multi-domain data, like human trajectories, base station information and Points-of-Interest attributes. For that, we propose a joint nonnegative matrix factorization model to combine the multi-source data and extract the function distribution of each urban region, then the dominated function among the regions can be uncovered based on the clustering process over the extracted distributions. We also evaluate the performance of our method on the real-world dataset to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model over the baseline methods. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data like","matrix factorization","based model","baseline methods","district attributes","domain data","dominated function","extracted distributions","factorization based","factorization model","function distribution","hospital districts","human trajectories","integrating data","joint matrix","joint nonnegative","like human","like mobility","mobility information","nonnegative matrix","planning recently","propose joint","proposed model","recently researchers","region functions","researchers try","residential entertainment","revealing functional","single domain","station information","statistical models","trajectories base","uncovered based","urban region","various functions","base station","clustering process","data based","model various","previous work","mobility data","functional regions","human mobility","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data like","matrix factorization","based model","baseline methods","data based","district attributes","domain data","dominated function","extracted distributions","factorization based","factorization model","function distribution","hospital districts","human trajectories","integrating data","joint matrix","joint nonnegative","like human","like mobility","mobility information","model various","nonnegative matrix","planning recently","previous work","propose joint","proposed model","recently researchers","region functions","researchers try","residential entertainment","revealing functional","single domain","station information","statistical models","trajectories base","uncovered based","urban region","various functions","base station","clustering process","functional regions","mobility data","human mobility","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data like","matrix factorization","base station","based model","baseline methods","data based","district attributes","domain data","dominated function","extracted distributions","factorization based","factorization model","function distribution","hospital districts","human trajectories","integrating data","joint matrix","joint nonnegative","like human","like mobility","mobility data","mobility information","model various","nonnegative matrix","planning recently","previous work","propose joint","proposed model","recently researchers","region functions","researchers try","residential entertainment","revealing functional","single domain","station information","statistical models","trajectories base","uncovered based","urban region","various functions","clustering process","functional regions","human mobility","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":393,"Year":2017,"Title":"Multiscale spatio-temporal data aggregation and mapping for urban data exploration","Abstract":"Maps seem the most intuitive way to visualize massive urban data but they also raise some well-known graphical problems (such as visual clutter, etc.).

It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related. Building-related indicators include building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and traffic-related indicators include traffic volume, speed and percentage of heavy vehicle.

We have built a classification problem with two classes, landslides and stable areas, and applied SVMs algorithms in the districts Byt\u010da, Kysuck\u00e9 Nov\u00e9 Mesto and \u017dilina. A spatial database of landslides areas and geologically stable areas from the State Geological Institute of Dion\u00fdz \u0160t\u00far were used to fit SVMs models. Four environmental input parameters, land use, lithology, aspect and slope were used to train support vector machines models. During the training phase, the primal objective was to find optimal sets of kernel parameters by grid search. The linear, polynomial and radial basis function kernels were computed. Together 534 models were trained and tested with LIBLINEAR and LIBSVM libraries. Models were evaluated by Accuracy parameter. Then the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and landslides susceptibility maps were produced for the best model for every kernel. The best predictive performance was gained by radial basis function kernel. This kernel has also the best generalization ability. The results showed that SVMs employed in the presented study gave promising results with more than 0.90 (the area under the ROC curve (AUC) prediction performance. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["landslides susceptibility","vector machines","basis function","radial basis","stable areas","support vector","accuracy parameter","applied svms","auc prediction","best generalization","built classification","byt\u010da kysuck\u00e9","classes landslides","classification problem","dion\u00fdz \u0161t\u00far","districts byt\u010da","economic loss","environmental input","find optimal","fit svms","four environmental","function kernel","function kernels","gave promising","generalization ability","geological institute","geologically stable","great economic","grid search","human life","input parameters","kernel parameters","kysuck\u00e9 nov\u00e9","landslides areas","libraries models","libsvm libraries","linear polynomial","lithology aspect","machines models","machines svms","main purpose","mapping landslides","models four","nov\u00e9 mesto","optimal sets","parameters land","possible applicability","prediction performance","presented study","primal objective","promising results","spatial database","state geological","study gave","susceptibility prediction","svms algorithms","svms employed","svms models","train support","training phase","two classes","use lithology","\u017eilina spatial","best model","best predictive","predictive performance","susceptibility models","curve auc","roc curve","susceptibility maps","characteristic roc","landslide susceptibility","susceptibility mapping","operating characteristic","receiver operating","results showed","land use","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["landslides susceptibility","vector machines","support vector","basis function","radial basis","stable areas","accuracy parameter","applied svms","auc prediction","best generalization","best model","best predictive","built classification","byt\u010da kysuck\u00e9","classes landslides","classification problem","dion\u00fdz \u0161t\u00far","districts byt\u010da","economic loss","environmental input","find optimal","fit svms","four environmental","function kernel","function kernels","gave promising","generalization ability","geological institute","geologically stable","great economic","grid search","human life","input parameters","kernel parameters","kysuck\u00e9 nov\u00e9","landslides areas","libraries models","libsvm libraries","linear polynomial","lithology aspect","machines models","machines svms","main purpose","mapping landslides","models four","nov\u00e9 mesto","optimal sets","parameters land","possible applicability","prediction performance","predictive performance","presented study","primal objective","promising results","spatial database","state geological","study gave","susceptibility prediction","svms algorithms","svms employed","svms models","train support","training phase","two classes","use lithology","\u017eilina spatial","curve auc","roc curve","susceptibility maps","susceptibility models","characteristic roc","operating characteristic","receiver operating","susceptibility mapping","land use","results showed","landslide susceptibility","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["landslides susceptibility","vector machines","support vector","basis function","radial basis","stable areas","accuracy parameter","applied svms","auc prediction","best generalization","best model","best predictive","built classification","byt\u010da kysuck\u00e9","classes landslides","classification problem","dion\u00fdz \u0161t\u00far","districts byt\u010da","economic loss","environmental input","find optimal","fit svms","four environmental","function kernel","function kernels","gave promising","generalization ability","geological institute","geologically stable","great economic","grid search","human life","input parameters","kernel parameters","kysuck\u00e9 nov\u00e9","landslides areas","libraries models","libsvm libraries","linear polynomial","lithology aspect","machines models","machines svms","main purpose","mapping landslides","models four","nov\u00e9 mesto","optimal sets","parameters land","possible applicability","prediction performance","predictive performance","presented study","primal objective","promising results","spatial database","state geological","study gave","susceptibility prediction","svms algorithms","svms employed","svms models","train support","training phase","two classes","use lithology","\u017eilina spatial","curve auc","roc curve","susceptibility maps","susceptibility models","characteristic roc","operating characteristic","receiver operating","susceptibility mapping","landslide susceptibility","results showed","land use","urban planning"]},{"DocId":397,"Year":2017,"Title":"Data mining tourism patterns","Abstract":"In this study we show how Call Detail Record (CDR) can be used to better understand the travel patterns of visitors.

This study seeks to maximize the power of LiDAR imagery to be able to classify buildings without the aid of multispectral imagery. This work follows the Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach. Instead of the traditional pixel-based classification methods, pixels are segmented into logical groups called objects. From these objects, features for building extraction are calculated. These features are: the number of returns, difference of returns, and the mean and standard deviation of positive surface openness. These objects are then classified using different machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques. A prototype implementation of layer is presented in a simulated validation scenario. The prototype allows an expert user to monitor threat probabilities for different physical environments, and influence the sensitivity of these environments in real-time as well as and provide feedback for adapting the machine learning models. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["expert user","reasoning layer","terrorist actions","terroristic attacks","threat

becoming much more important than ever before, especially in mobile services. Being widespread, less cost of energy and almost free for collecting data make mobile phone a perfect location sensor probe. Meaningful location name rather than digital coordinates could provide much more valuable information. In this paper, we develop a location semantic predicting method referred to Location Annotation(LA) which can automatically annotate meaningful base stations of phone users with semantic tags such as 'home', 'work place' and 'club'. We extract several explicit features from phone records and spatial-temporal patterns of mobile phone users to build an annotation model based on Maximum Entropy Model. Then a machine learning method is presented to estimate the best configuration of parameters in the model. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate good performance of our method.

Therefore, researches on land cover and its landscape pattern change under urbanization are essential for analyzing the impacts of human activities on environment. This study firstly detected land cover (i.e., forestland, non-forest vegetation, built-up area, and water) changes in Changsha City from 1973 to 2005 by using the multi-temporal Landsat images (TM1973, TM1993, TM1998, ETM+2001) and land use map (2005); and then analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of landscape pattern at landscape-level and class-level by using FRAGSTATS, respectively. At last, the class-level metrics of each land cover class were further regressed to the degree of urbanization. The results indicated that: (1) in the context of urbanization, the built-up area and the non-forest vegetation experienced a significant changes, while the forestland and water remained relatively unchanged, and the non-forest vegetation cover bore the major burden of urbanization; (2) with the advance of urbanization, the change of overall landscape pattern of Changsha represented a complex dynamic process; (3) obvious differences of impacts of urbanization on landscape patterns of various land cover classes existed, i.e., along with the decrease of MPS of non-forest vegetation, the AI of built-up area increased dramatically; (4) some class-level metrics of various land cover classes were strongly correlated to the degree of urbanization, but the correlated extend varied along with the various land cover classes. To sum up, this study demonstrated the differences of impacts of urbanization on various land cover patterns.

Existing strategies and practices within the traditional road traffic safety portfolio were identified, and recommendations for improvement were made in order to maximise the impact of these practices on road traffic safety. There was also a need to draw in role players outside the traditional safety sphere to commit time and funds towards the improvement of road traffic safety in the Province The methodology followed to develop the strategy consisted of a review of relevant documentation, an assessment of information systems and collection of data, interviews and discussions with role players on provincial, metropolitan and local levels within all related disciplines. The development of a Road Traffic Safety Management Strategy required a comprehensive analysis of the current road traffic safety situation in the Western Cape, as well as an assessment of the current approach to provincial management. The vision of the Western Cape Traffic Safety Management Strategy \"A Safer Road Environment for AI\" embraces the provincial vision for \"A Home for AII\", and the vision adopted by the Department of Community Safety, which is \"A Safer Home For AII\". The Strategy furthermore embraces the concept of Holistic Governance, with its pillars of Integrated, Co-operative and Responsive Governance.

We consider street context as the inferred usage of the street, based on its buildings and construction, categorized in nine possible labels. The labels define whether the street is residential, commercial or downtown, throughway or not, and other special categories. We apply the analysis to the City of Boston, considering daily trajectories synthetically generated with a model based on call detail records (CDR) and images from Google Street View. Images are categorized both manually and using artificial intelligence (AI). We focus on the city\u2019s four main racial\/ethnic demographic groups (White, Black, Hispanic and Asian), aiming to characterize the differences in what these groups of people see during their daily activities. Based on daily trajectories, we reconstruct most common paths over the street network. We use street demand (number of times a street is included in a trajectory) to detect each group\u2019s most relevant streets and regions. Based on their street demand, we measure the street context distribution for each group. The inclusion of images allows us to quantitatively measure the prevalence of each context and points to qualitative differences on where that context takes place. Other AI methodologies can further exploit these differences. This approach presents the building blocks to further studies that relate mobile devices\u2019 dynamic records with the differences in urban exposure by demographic groups. The addition of AI-based image analysis to street demand can power up the capabilities of urban planning methodologies, compare multiple cities under a unified framework, and reduce the crudeness of GIS-only mobility analysis.

This study's classification method helps establish a nexus among urban form, building structures, and materials and resource requirements, thus contributing to the advance of sustainable urban studies, such as urban metabolism and ecological planning. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building structures","automated classification","ml algorithms","urban environment","achieving approximately","automatically due","average recall","beijing china","boosted decision","buildings relatively","built environment","developed machine","different structure","ecological planning","effective achieving","enable automated","environment especially","environment identification","especially buildings","establish nexus","five common","form building","gradient boosted","helps establish","identify automatically","method helps","method ml","ml features","ml method","overall performance","popular ml","relatively tacit","resource requirements","study classification","study developed","sustainable urban","tacit structural","testing data","tree delivered","twelve popular","urban built","urban form","urban function","urban metabolism","classification method","common structures","decision tree","highest overall","identification using","learning ml","recall precision","structural attributes","structure types","using machine","urban studies","complex urban","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building structures","automated classification","ml algorithms","urban environment","achieving approximately","automatically due","average recall","beijing china","boosted decision","buildings relatively","built environment","classification method","developed machine","different structure","ecological planning","effective achieving","enable automated","environment especially","environment identification","especially buildings","establish nexus","five common","form building","gradient boosted","helps establish","highest overall","identify automatically","method helps","method ml","ml features","ml method","overall performance","popular ml","relatively tacit","resource requirements","study classification","study developed","sustainable urban","tacit structural","testing data","tree delivered","twelve popular","urban built","urban form","urban function","urban metabolism","common structures","decision tree","identification using","learning ml","recall precision","structural attributes","structure types","using machine","urban studies","complex urban","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["building structures","automated classification","ml algorithms","urban environment","achieving approximately","automatically due","average recall","beijing china","boosted decision","buildings relatively","built environment","classification method","common structures","developed machine","different structure","ecological planning","effective achieving","enable automated","environment especially","environment identification","especially buildings","establish nexus","five common","form building","gradient boosted","helps establish","highest overall","identification using","identify automatically","learning ml","method helps","method ml","ml features","ml method","overall performance","popular ml","recall precision","relatively tacit","resource requirements","structural attributes","study classification","study developed","sustainable urban","tacit structural","testing data","tree delivered","twelve popular","urban built","urban form","urban function","urban metabolism","urban studies","using machine","complex urban","decision tree","structure types","machine learning"]},{"DocId":412,"Year":2021,"Title":"A generative architectural and urban design method through artificial neural networks","Abstract":"Machine learning, as a computational tool for finding mappings between the input and output data, has been widely used in engineering fields. Researchers have applied machine learning models to generate 2D drawings with pixels or 3D models with voxels, but the pixelization reduces the precision of the geometries. Therefore, in order to learn and generate 3D geometries as vectorized models with higher precision and faster computation speed, we develop a specific artificial neural network, learning and generating design features for the forms of buildings. A customized data structure with feature parameters is constructed, meeting the requirements of the neural network by rebuilding surfaces with controlling points and appending additional input neurons as quantified vectors to describe the properties of the design. The neural network is first trained with generated design data and then tested by adjusting the feature parameters. The prediction of the generated data shows the basic generative ability of the neural network. Furthermore, trained with design data collected from existing buildings, the neural network learns and infers the geometric design features of architectural design with different feature parameters, providing a data-driven method for designers to generate and analyze architectural forms. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["neural network","feature parameters","design data","design features","artificial neural","machine learning","additional input","analyze architectural","appending additional","architectural forms","basic generative","buildings customized","computation speed","computational tool","constructed meeting","controlling points","customized data","data shows","data structure","develop specific","different feature","engineering fields","existing buildings","faster computation","fields researchers","finding mappings","generate drawings","generate geometries","generated data","generated design","generating design","generative ability","generative architectural","geometric design","higher precision","input neurons","learning models","network learning","network learns","networks machine","output data","parameters providing","pixelization reduces","providing method","quantified vectors","rebuilding surfaces","specific artificial","vectorized models","applied machine","data collected","design method","neural networks","architectural design","urban design"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["neural network","feature parameters","design data","design features","artificial neural","machine learning","additional input","analyze architectural","appending additional","architectural forms","basic generative","buildings customized","computation speed","computational tool","constructed meeting","controlling points","customized data","data collected","data shows","data structure","design method","develop specific","different feature","engineering fields","existing buildings","faster computation","fields researchers","finding mappings","generate drawings","generate geometries","generated data","generated design","generating design","generative ability","generative architectural","geometric design","higher precision","input neurons","learning models","network learning","network learns","networks machine","output data","parameters providing","pixelization reduces","providing method","quantified vectors","rebuilding surfaces","specific artificial","vectorized models","applied machine","architectural design","neural networks","urban design"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["neural network","feature parameters","design data","design features","artificial neural","machine learning","additional input","analyze architectural","appending additional","applied machine","architectural forms","basic generative","buildings customized","computation speed","computational tool","constructed meeting","controlling points","customized data","data collected","data shows","data structure","design method","develop specific","different feature","engineering fields","existing buildings","faster computation","fields researchers","finding mappings","generate drawings","generate geometries","generated data","generated design","generating design","generative ability","generative architectural","geometric design","higher precision","input neurons","learning models","network learning","network learns","networks machine","output data","parameters providing","pixelization reduces","providing method","quantified vectors","rebuilding surfaces","specific artificial","vectorized models","neural networks","architectural design","urban design"]},{"DocId":413,"Year":2021,"Title":"Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach","Abstract":"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July\u2013December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mosquito occurrence","combined influences","dengue incidence","climate factors","mob

anthropogenic impacts on local climates, have been a growing concern especially for high-density urban areas such as Istanbul. This paper outlines the use of a supervised machine learning technique to understand the effects of the urban fabric on surface urban heat island (SUHI) formation in Istanbul, and identify effective variables to provide a basis for research and practice focusing on SUHI mitigation. An analysis using the Ridge Regression Model found that 71% of land surface temperature anomalies in Istanbul are linked to building coverage ratio (BCR), surface\/volume ratio (SVR), sky-view factor (SVF), canyon geometry factor (CGF), and vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI and BCR were the urban fabric components with the highest contribution to SUHI formation, while the effects of SVF and CGF remained relatively low. This research can help planners and designers gauge the contribution of the urban fabric to micro-climate issues and adapt SUHI mitigation strategies for projects aiming to build climate-sensitive urban environments.

Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods. \u00a9 2021","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air pollution","smart cities","air quality","design planning","environment design","staked sae","term memory","different aspects","long term","smart city","smart environment","deep learning","advancement conventional","assisted staked","cities development","cities long","cities staked","city based","classification accuracy","conventional methods","current scenario","developed cities","disappointing results","dl methods","error rate","evaluate air","existing methods","forecasting primarily","generate disappointing","government agencies","grow rapidly","human advancement","human environment","increasingly concerned","industrialization grow","influence air","intrinsic components","learning dl","lstm assisted","measurement based","models generate","occur due","overall error","paper long","planning prediction","pollution forecasting","pollution measurement","pollution quality","population growth","prepared gently","primarily use","rapidly government","sae model","severe air","thorough design","uncertainty analysis","use simulations","various areas","effective method","findings indicate","learning machine","memory lstm","quality prediction","learning ml","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air pollution","smart cities","air quality","deep learning","design planning","environment design","long term","smart city","smart environment","staked sae","term memory","different aspects","advancement conventional","assisted staked","cities development","cities long","cities staked","city based","classification accuracy","conventional methods","current scenario","developed cities","disappointing results","dl methods","error rate","evaluate air","existing methods","findings indicate","forecasting primarily","generate disappointing","government agencies","grow rapidly","human advancement","human environment","increasingly concerned","industrialization grow","influence air","intrinsic components","learning dl","lstm assisted","measurement based","memory lstm","models generate","occur due","overall error","paper long","planning prediction","pollution forecasting","pollution measurement","pollution quality","population growth","prepared gently","primarily use","rapidly government","sae model","severe air","thorough design","uncertainty analysis","use simulations","various areas","effective method","learning machine","learning ml","quality prediction","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air pollution","smart cities","air quality","deep learning","design planning","environment design","long term","smart city","smart environment","staked sae","term memory","different aspects","advancement conventional","assisted staked","cities development","cities long","cities staked","city based","classification accuracy","conventional methods","current scenario","developed cities","disappointing results","dl methods","error rate","evaluate air","existing methods","findings indicate","forecasting primarily","generate disappointing","government agencies","grow rapidly","human advancement","human environment","increasingly concerned","industrialization grow","influence air","intrinsic components","learning dl","lstm assisted","measurement based","memory lstm","models generate","occur due","overall error","paper long","planning prediction","pollution forecasting","pollution measurement","pollution quality","population growth","prepared gently","primarily use","rapidly government","sae model","severe air","thorough design","uncertainty analysis","use simulations","various areas","effective method","learning machine","learning ml","quality prediction","machine learning"]},{"DocId":416,"Year":2021,"Title":"DTEx: A dynamic urban thermal exposure index based on human mobility patterns","Abstract":"Background: Extreme heat in light of climate change is increasingly threatening the health and comfort of urban residents. Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of heat exposure is a critical factor in directing mitigation measures. Current heat vulnerability indices provide insight into heat sensitivities within given communities but do not account for the dynamic nature of the human movement as people travel for different activities. Here, we present a new Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure index (DTEx) that captures the varying heat exposure within urban environments. Methods: We developed the DTEx to understand human heat exposure patterns in a mid-sized city. This index incorporates the human movement pattern and the heat hazard pattern obtained via novel and advanced techniques. We generated the human movement pattern from large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data. The heat hazard patterns were extrapolated via machine learning models from air temperature data measured through vehicle-mounted sensors. The exposure index was then developed by combining the two parameters using their standard-deviation-classified indices. Results: Our exposure index varied between 2 and 12, indicating low to high thermal exposures. Several high-temperature spots associated with a large volume of foot traffic are successfully identified through this DTEx. We observed the hottest spots at shopping plazas but not specifically in the urban center. During the selected football gameday, the exposure index surged across most places near the football stadium but was reduced considerably further away. Discussion: The proposed DTEx is novel because it provides dynamic heat monitoring capability to facilitate heat mitigation strategies at vulnerable locations in urban environments. Combining the mobility data and extensive sensor data generates rich details on the most heat-exposed areas due to human congregation. Such information will be critical for risk communication and urban planning for policymakers. DTEx could also help smart route planning in sustainable cities to avoid heat hazards risks. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["exposure index","human

data-driven agent-based simulation to predict crime patterns in an urban environment","Abstract":"Spatial crime simulations contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that drive crime and can support decision-makers in developing effective crime reduction strategies. Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction. \u00a9 2021","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["crime patterns","urban environment","crime reduction","crime simulations","data layers","data sources","activity based","agent level","agents navigate","article identifies","available data","builds virtual","collects relevant","crime builds","data contributes","developing effective","drive crime","dynamic geographical","effective crime","environment spatial","finally generates","findings highlight","generate crime","generates crime","geographical environments","highest number","identifies numerous","important drivers","individual agent","individual offender","integrate geographical","interaction layers","navigate proposes","numerous important","offender agents","patterns collects","predict crime","predictive performance","predictive tool","process using","proposes process","reduction strategies","relevant openly","resulting model","resulting predictions","simulated urban","simulations contribute","spatial crime","spatial layer","strategies models","street segments","support crime","temporal features","test platform","various open","virtual urban","work lies","crime prediction","criminal activity","features relevant","spatial data","spatial temporal","various data","high resolution","open data","openly available","recent years","results show","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["crime patterns","urban environment","crime reduction","crime simulations","data layers","data sources","activity based","agent level","agents navigate","article identifies","available data","builds virtual","collects relevant","crime builds","crime prediction","criminal activity","data contributes","developing effective","drive crime","dynamic geographical","effective crime","environment spatial","features relevant","finally generates","findings highlight","generate crime","generates crime","geographical environments","highest number","identifies numerous","important drivers","individual agent","individual offender","integrate geographical","interaction layers","navigate proposes","numerous important","offender agents","open data","patterns collects","predict crime","predictive performance","predictive tool","process using","proposes process","recent years","reduction strategies","relevant openly","resulting model","resulting predictions","simulated urban","simulations contribute","spatial crime","spatial data","spatial layer","spatial temporal","strategies models","street segments","support crime","temporal features","test platform","various data","various open","virtual urban","work lies","high resolution","openly available","results show","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["crime patterns","urban environment","crime reduction","crime simulations","data layers","data sources","activity based","agent level","agents navigate","article identifies","available data","builds virtual","collects relevant","crime builds","crime prediction","criminal activity","data contributes","developing effective","drive crime","dynamic geographical","effective crime","environment spatial","finally generates","findings highlight","generate crime","generates crime","geographical environments","highest number","identifies numerous","important drivers","individual agent","individual offender","integrate geographical","interaction layers","navigate proposes","numerous important","offender agents","open data","patterns collects","predict crime","predictive performance","predictive tool","process using","proposes process","recent years","reduction strategies","relevant openly","resulting model","resulting predictions","simulated urban","simulations contribute","spatial crime","spatial layer","spatial temporal","strategies models","street segments","support crime","temporal features","test platform","various data","various open","virtual urban","work lies","features relevant","spatial data","high resolution","openly available","results show","machine learning"]},{"DocId":418,"Year":2021,"Title":"Geospatial simulation of urban neighbourhood densification potentials","Abstract":"Although densification of urban areas is being proposed as a sustainable urbanisation strategy, frameworks for detailed large-scale analysis of densification potentials and their evaluation are lacking. A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4\u201315 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["densification potentials","geospatial simulation","neighbourhood densification","residential areas","additional inhabitants","archetype classification","architectural designs","assessing spatially","central areas","considerable densification","current mobility","current population","densification locations","densification neighbourhoods","densification opportunities","densification potential","densification strategies","densification strategy","designs potentials","detailed analysis","developed framework","different neighbourhood","evaluate densification","explicit densification","geospatial analysis","high number","lacking geospatial","localised using","locations considerable","mobility infrastructure","national scale","neighbourhood archetypes","neighbourhood level","neighbourhoods range","particularly promising","populating urban","presented approach","prioritising densification","scale using","simulated additional","simulation framework","spatially explicit","strategies potentials","strategy frameworks","supervised archetype","sustainable densification","sustainable urbanisation","switzerland depending","urban neighbourhood","urban neighbourhoods","urbanisation strategy","using geospatial","using supervised","public transportation","urban areas"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["densification potentials","geospatial simulation","neighbourhood densification","residential areas","additional inhabitants","archetype classification","architectural designs","assessing spatially","central areas","considerable densification","current mobility","current population","densification locations","densification neighbourhoods","densification opportunities","densification potential","densification strategies","densification strategy","designs potentials","detailed analysis","developed framework","different neighbourhood","evaluate densification","explicit densification","geospatial analysis","high number","lacking geospatial","localised using","locations considerable","mobility infrastructure","neighbourhood archetypes","neighbourhood level","neighbourhoods range","particularly promising","populating urban","presented approach","prioritising densification","public transportation","scale using","simulated additional","simulation framework","spatially explicit","strategies potentials","strategy frameworks","supervised archetype","sustainable densification","sustainable urbanisation","switzerland depending","urban neighbourhood","urban neighbourhoods","urbanisation strategy","using geospatial","using supervised","national scale","urban areas"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["densification potentials","geospatial simulation","neighbourhood densification","residential areas","additional inhabitants","archetype classification","architectural designs","assessing spatially","central areas","considerable densification","current mobility","current population","densification locations","densification neighbourhoods","densification opportunities","densification potential","densification strategies","densification strategy","designs potentials","detailed analysis","developed framework","different neighbourhood","evaluate densification","explicit densification","geospatial analysis","high number","lacking geospatial","localised using","locations considerable","mobility infrastructure","national scale","neighbourhood archetypes","neighbourhood level","neighbourhoods range","particularly promising","populating urban","presented approach","prioritising densification","public transportation","scale using","simulated additional","simulation framework","spatially explicit","strategies potentials","strategy frameworks","supervised archetype","sustainable densification","sustainable urbanisation","switzerland depending","urban neighbourhood","urban neighbourhoods","urbanisation strategy","using geospatial","using supervised","urban areas"]},{"DocId":419,"Year":2021,"Title":"Unveiling transit mobility structure towards sustainable cities: An integrated graph embedding approach","Abstract":"Detecting urban mobility structure, i.e., segmenting urban areas into disjoint clusters with similar mobility patterns, can facilitate our understanding of how a city is organized and how different parts of a city interact with each other, which underpin informed decision-making in achieving sustainable urban transportation development and resilient society. In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit

A smart city collects diverse information to monitor and analyze urban systems, such as energy management. It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["smart city","stacking ensemble","ensemble model","energy data","ensemble networks","energy consumption","analyze urban","ann catboost","applied using","base regressors","baseline regressors","best ensemble","best model","city case","city collects","collects diverse","design baseline","develop stacking","diverse information","energy management","finally weighted","generate energy","improve performance","korea nowadays","korean smart","meta model","model combines","model outperforms","model stacking","monitor energy","performance prediction","possibilities offered","prediction problem","prediction yielding","proposed stacking","resulting model","results support","songdo focusing","songdo south","south korean","studies smart","urban systems","use artificial","weighted meta","weighted model","consumption prediction","networks ann","neural networks","smart cities","energy efficiency","south korea","artificial neural","learning models","urban studies","gradient boosting","case study","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["smart city","stacking ensemble","ensemble model","energy data","ensemble networks","energy consumption","analyze urban","ann catboost","applied using","base regressors","baseline regressors","best ensemble","best model","city case","city collects","collects diverse","design baseline","develop stacking","diverse information","energy management","finally weighted","generate energy","gradient boosting","improve performance","korea nowadays","korean smart","meta model","model combines","model outperforms","model stacking","monitor energy","networks ann","neural networks","performance prediction","possibilities offered","prediction problem","prediction yielding","proposed stacking","resulting model","results support","songdo focusing","songdo south","south korean","studies smart","urban studies","urban systems","use artificial","weighted meta","weighted model","artificial neural","case study","consumption prediction","smart cities","south korea","learning models","energy efficiency","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["smart city","stacking ensemble","ensemble model","energy data","ensemble networks","energy consumption","analyze urban","ann catboost","applied using","base regressors","baseline regressors","best ensemble","best model","city case","city collects","collects diverse","design baseline","develop stacking","diverse information","energy management","finally weighted","generate energy","improve performance","korea nowadays","korean smart","meta model","model combines","model outperforms","model stacking","monitor energy","networks ann","neural networks","performance prediction","possibilities offered","prediction problem","prediction yielding","proposed stacking","resulting model","results support","songdo focusing","songdo south","south korean","studies smart","urban systems","use artificial","weighted meta","weighted model","artificial neural","case study","consumption prediction","smart cities","south korea","urban studies","gradient boosting","learning models","energy efficiency","machine learning"]},{"DocId":421,"Year":2021,"Title":"Evaluation of the environmental impacts of urbanization from the viewpoint of increased skin temperatures: a case study from Istanbul, Turkey","Abstract":"Urbanization is an inevitable process all around the world especially in developing countries like Turkey. Istanbul has been experiencing rapid urban expansion for the past 60\u00a0years. This urban expansion is leading to the replacement of forests by various artificial surfaces. This situation has a critical impact on the natural surfaces due to the alteration of heat energy balance. In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use\/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3\u00a0km2, and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260\u00a0km2. Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years. \u00a9 2021, Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["artificial surfaces","environmental impacts","skin

quality of life of citizens, while pursuing sustainability. This study proposes an AI and human co-operative evaluation (AIHCE) framework that facilitates communication design between designers and stakeholders based on human emotions and values and is an evaluation method for street space. AIHCE is an evaluation method based on image recognition technology that performs deep learning of the facial expressions of both people and the city; namely, it consists of a facial expression recognition model (FERM) and a street image evaluation model (SIEM). The former evaluates the street space based on the emotions and values of the pedestrian\u2019s facial expression, and the latter evaluates the target street space from the prepared street space image. AIHCE is an integrated framework for these two models, enabling continuous and objective evaluation of space with simultaneous subjective emotional evaluation, showing the possibility of reflecting it in the design. It is expected to contribute to fostering people\u2019s awareness that streets are public goods reflecting the basic functions of public spaces and the values and regional characteristics of residents, contributing to the improvement of the sustainability of the entire city. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

However, human perception (e.g., imageability) have a subtle relationship to visual elements that cannot be fully captured using view indices. Conversely, subjective measures using survey and interview data explain human behaviors more. However, the effectiveness of integrating subjective measures with SVI datasets has been less discussed. To address this, we integrated crowdsourcing, CV, and machine learning (ML) to subjectively measure four important perceptions suggested by classical urban design theory. We first collected ratings from experts on sample SVIs regarding these four qualities, which became the training labels. CV segmentation was applied to SVI samples extracting streetscape view indices as the explanatory variables. We then trained ML models and achieved high accuracy in predicting scores. We found a strong correlation between the predicted complexity score and the density of urban amenities and services points of interest (POI), which validates the effectiveness of subjective measures. In addition, to test the generalizability of the proposed framework as well as to inform urban renewal strategies, we compared the measured qualities in Pudong to other five urban cores that are renowned worldwide. Rather than predicting perceptual scores directly from generic image features using a convolution neural network, our approach follows what urban design theory has suggested and confirmed as various streetscape features affecting multi-dimensional human perceptions. Therefore, the results provide more interpretable and actionable implications for policymakers and city planners. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

parks can contribute to significant cooling effect for the city microclimate and, therefore, promote urban residents\u2019 outdoor thermal comfort. As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI\/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5\u00a0ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s),

especially when the ROC fails to reflect the unbalanced effect of prediction variables. A variable drop-off loop function, based on the concept of early termination for reduction of model capacity, regularization, and generalization control, was tested. A susceptibility index for airborne particulate matter of less than 10 \u03bcm diameter (PM10) was modeled using monthly maximum values and spectral bands and indices from Landsat 8 imagery, and Open Street Maps were used to prepare a range of independent variables. Probability and classification index maps were prepared using extreme-gradient boosting (XGBOOST) and random forest (RF) algorithms. These were assessed against utility criteria such as a confusion matrix of overall accuracy, quantity of variables, processing delay, degree of overfitting, importance distribution, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).

The ever-increasing global capture of cities in 360\u25e6 provides considerable new opportunities for data-driven urban research. This paper provides the first comprehensive, state-of-the-art review on the use of street-level imagery for urban analysis in five research areas: built environment and land use; health and wellbeing; natural environment; urban modelling and demographic surveillance; and area quality and reputation. Panoramic street-level imagery provides advantages in comparison to remotely sensed imagery and conventional urban data sources, whether manual, automated, or machine learning data extraction techniques are applied. Key advantages include low-cost, rapid, high-resolution, and wide-scale data capture, enhanced safety through remote presence, and a unique pedestrian\/vehicle point of view for analyzing cities at the scale and perspective in which they are experienced. However, several limitations are evident, including limited ability to capture attribute information, unreliability for temporal analyses, limited use for depth and distance analyses, and the role of corporations as image-data gatekeepers.

Among the different methods proposed, the approaches based on supervised machine learning (ML) achieve the best results. This paper aims to investigate building footprint extraction using only high-resolution raster digital surface model (DSM) data by comparing the performance of three different popular supervised ML models on a benchmark dataset. The first two methods rely on a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and a classical ML (support vector machine (SVM)) or a shallow neural network (extreme learning machine (ELM)) classifier, and the third model is a fully convolutional network (FCN) based on deep learning with transfer learning. Used data were obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) and cover the urban areas of Vaihingen an der Enz, Potsdam, and Toronto. The results indicated that performances of models based on shallow ML (feature extraction and classifier training) are affected by the urban context investigated (F1 scores from 0.49 to 0.81), whereas the FCN-based model proved to be the most robust and best-performing method for building extraction from a high-resolution raster DSM (F1 scores from 0.80 to 0.86). \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds segmentation and accurate classification are challenging and crucial to produce different geo-information products like three-dimensional (3D) city designs. This paper introduces an effective data-driven approach to build roof superstructures classification for airborne LiDAR point clouds with very low density and imbalanced classes, covering an urban area. Notably, it focuses on building roof superstructures (especially dormers and chimneys) and mitigating nonplanar objects' problems. Also, the imbalanced class problem of LiDAR data, to the best of our knowledge, is not yet addressed in the literature; it is considered in this study. The major advantage of the proposed approach is using only raw data without assumptions on the distribution underlying data. The main methodological novelties of this work are summarized in the following key elements. (i) At first, an adapted connected component analysis for 3D points cloud is proposed. (ii) Twelve geometry-based features are extracted for each component. (iii) A Support Vector Machine (SVM)-driven procedure is applied to classify the 3D components. (iv) Furthermore, a new component size-based sampling (CSBS) method is proposed to treat the imbalanced data problem and has been compared with several existing resampling strategies. In this study, components are classified into five classes: shed and gable dormers, chimneys, ground, and others. The results of this investigation show the satisfying classification performance of the proposed approach. Results also showed that the proposed approach outperformed machine learning methods, including SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Adaboost. \u00a9 2001-2012

China","Abstract":"The significant economic development witnessed in China in recent decades has been accompanied by the increasing expansion of urban areas. Although a growing literature has analyzed the characteristics and driving forces of urban land expansion, less attention has been paid to examining the different expansion determinants driving fine-scale urban land use (residential land, administration and public services land, commercial land, and industrial land) change. This paper aims to identify the differences of multi-mechanisms driving fine-scale urban land use expansion based on big data and machine learning, in the Huizhou downtown area in 2000\u20132015. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to identify the natural, transportation, location, social, and POI factors driving land expansion by considering different urban land-use categories. Our RF estimations showed that enormous differences existed between various urban land-use types in terms of the role they played in this expansion and their relation to potential determinants, during the different urban development stages studied. Transportation, location, and the distribution of actual land use were found to exert a greater influence on urban land expansion than other factors. All the findings above provide detailed spatiotemporal knowledge and targeted information that can aid in understanding fine-scale urban land use dynamics. In this way, sound planning strategies for different fine-scale land uses can be formulated more scientifically. The strength of association between these factors and urban land expansion differed greatly depending on the different land-use types involved as well as the urban development stage that it occurred within. These results cast a new light on the importance of investigating the potential driving forces in the expansion of different urban land-use types. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier

In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. \u00a9 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["housing estates","assessment using","development scale","economic assessment","economic sustainability","housing estate","residential units","shared amenities","using machine","amenities using","approach economic","common facilities","critical limit","development bulk","economic growth","economic relationship","estates housing","excessively low","existing theories","gradually fall","growing population","hong kong","household concentration","household share","housing supply","housing values","increase sufficiently","initially rise","level urban","like condos","local project","national level","nonlinear economic","optimize housing","owned residential","pay attention","point exists","policy implication","possible bottlenecks","privately owned","project level","property transaction","research attempts","strike balance","supply urban","theories suggest","threshold scale","tipping point","transaction data","units like","using two","values initially","extremely high","high levels","human settlement","population density","two decades","learning ml","ml techniques","sustainable development","learning approach","urban planners","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["housing estates","assessment using","development scale","economic assessment","economic sustainability","housing estate","residential units","shared amenities","using machine","amenities using","approach economic","common facilities","critical limit","development bulk","economic growth","economic relationship","estates housing","excessively low","existing theories","extremely high","gradually fall","growing population","household concentration","household share","housing supply","housing values","human settlement","increase sufficiently","initially rise","learning ml","like condos","local project","ml techniques","national level","nonlinear economic","optimize housing","owned residential","pay attention","point exists","policy implication","population density","possible bottlenecks","privately owned","project level","property transaction","research attempts","strike balance","supply urban","sustainable development","theories suggest","threshold scale","tipping point","transaction data","two decades","units like","using two","values initially","high levels","hong kong","level urban","learning approach","urban planners","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["housing estates","assessment using","development scale","economic assessment","economic sustainability","housing estate","residential units","shared amenities","using machine","amenities using","approach economic","common facilities","critical limit","development bulk","economic growth","economic relationship","estates housing","excessively low","existing theories","extremely high","gradually fall","growing population","hong kong","household concentration","household share","housing supply","housing values","human settlement","increase sufficiently","initially rise","learning ml","level urban","like condos","local project","ml techniques","national level","nonlinear economic","optimize housing","owned residential","pay attention","point exists","policy implication","possible bottlenecks","privately owned","project level","property transaction","research attempts","strike balance","supply urban","sustainable development","theories suggest","threshold scale","tipping point","transaction data","two decades","units like","using two","values initially","high levels","population density","urban planners","machine learning","learning approach","urban planning"]},{"DocId":433,"Year":2021,"Title":"Nordic Cities Meet Artificial Intelligence","Abstract":"In this paper, we explore Finnish city officials' attitudes, knowledge and relationship towards the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in their cities through topical expert interviews.

Each UAV has elementary cognitive skills to sense information about the nearby environment which are then fed as an input to the network. The neural network creates a correlation between the current state of a UAV and the best action to take at each time step. The exploration strategy is stored in a labeled database for the single-UAV case; the neural network learns and replicates it in the multi-UAV case, being able to generalize the acquired skills over new maps not contained in the database. The training session imitates human priors in a multi-class classification, which completely bypasses common drawbacks such as the need for large databases or high computational resources.

While roadside vegetation barriers can help mitigate TRAP, their effectiveness to reduce TRAP is influenced by site-specific conditions. To test vegetation designs using direct field measurements or high-fidelity numerical simulations is often infeasible since urban planners and local communities often lack the access and expertise to use those tools. There is a need for a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use method to evaluate vegetation barrier designs based on their capacity to mitigate TRAP. In this paper, we investigated five machine learning (ML) methods, including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and neural networks (NN), to predict size-resolved and locationally dependent particle concentrations downwind of various vegetation barrier designs. Data from 83 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations was used to train and test the ML models. We developed downwind region-specific models to capture the complexity of this problem and enhance the overall accuracy. Our feature space was composed of variables that can be feasibly obtained such as vegetation width, height, leaf area index (LAI), particle size, leaf area density (LAD) and wind speed at different heights. RF, NN, and XGB performed well with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 6\u20137% and an average test R2 value &gt;0.91, while SVM and LR had an NRMSE of approximately 13% and an average test R2 value of 0.56. Using feature selection, vegetation dimensions and particle size had the highest influence in predicting pollutant concentrations. The ML models developed can help create tools to aid local communities in developing mitigation strategies to address TRAP problems. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier

morphology contributes to the evolution of cities and sustainable development. Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots\u2019 figure\u2013ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences. This work could serve as a basis for further typo-morphology studies and other morphology-related ecological, social, and economic studies for sustainable built environments. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

two complementary pieces of cartographic information used for urban planning and environmental monitoring. In the context of New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot, the availability of up-to-date LULC maps is essential to monitor the impact of extreme events such as cyclones and human activities on the environment. With the democratization of satellite data and the development of high-performance deep learning techniques, it is possible to create these data automatically. This work aims at determining the best current deep learning configuration (pixel-wise vs. semantic labelling architectures, data augmentation, image prepos-sessing, \u2026 ), to perform LULC mapping in a complex, subtropical environment. For this purpose, a specific data set based on SPOT6 satellite data was created and made available for the scientific community as an LULC benchmark in a tropical, complex environment using five representative areas of New Caledonia labelled by a human operator: four used as training sets, and the fifth as a test set. Several architectures were trained and the resulting classification was compared with a state-of-the-art machine learning technique: XGboost. We also assessed the relevance of popular neo-channels derived from the raw observations in the context of deep learning. The deep learning approach showed comparable results to XGboost for LC detection and over-performed it on the LU detection task (61.45% vs. 51.56% of overall accuracy). Finally, adding LC classification output of the dedicated deep learning architecture to the raw channels input significantly improved the overall accuracy of the deep learning LU classification task (63.61% of overall accuracy). All the data used in this study are available on line for the remote sensing community and for assessing other LULC detection techniques. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

inequality","Abstract":"Enriching Asian perspectives on the rapid identification of urban poverty and its implications for housing inequality, this paper contributes empirical evidence about the utility of image features derived from high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning approaches for identifying urban poverty in China at the community level. For the case of the Jiangxia District and Huangpi District of Wuhan, image features, including perimeter, line segment detector (LSD), Hough transform, gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), histogram of oriented gradients (HoG), and local binary patterns (LBP), are calculated, and four machine learning approaches and 25 variables are applied to identify urban poverty and relatively important variables. The results show that image features and machine learning approaches can be used to identify urban poverty with the best model performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.5341 and 0.5324 for Jiangxia and Huangpi, respectively, although some differences exist among the approaches and study areas. The importance of each variable differs for each approach and study area; however, the relatively important variables are similar. In particular, four variables achieved relatively satisfactory prediction results for all models and presented obvious differences in varying communities with different poverty levels. Housing inequality within low-income neighborhoods, which is a response to gaps in wealth, income, and housing affordability among social groups, is an important manifestation of urban poverty. Policy makers can implement these findings to rapidly identify urban poverty, and the findings have potential applications for addressing housing inequality and proving the rationality of urban planning for building a sustainable society. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Traditionally, either urban or regional planning relies on the opinions of demographers in terms of how the population of a city or a region will grow. Multi-regional population forecast is currently possible, carried out mainly on the basis of the Interregional Cohort-Component model. While this model has its unique advantages, several demographic rates are determined based on the decisions made by primary planners. Hence, the only drawback for cohort-component type population forecasting is allowing the analyst to specify the demographic rates of the future, and it goes without saying that this tends to introduce a biased result in forecasting accuracy. To effectively avoid this problem, this work proposes a machine learning-based method to forecast multi-regional population growth objectively. Thus, this work, drawing upon the newly developed machine learning technology, attempts to analyze and forecast the population growth of major cities in Taiwan. By effectively using the advantage of the XGBoost algorithm, the evaluation of feature importance and the forecast of multi-regional population growth between the present and the near future can be observed objectively, and it can further provide an objective reference to the urban planning of regional population. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

At an urban level, this study collected various sources of data and proposed a machine learning method (Back Propagation Neural Network - BPNN) to predict different functions of UBCE by BEF in Changxing, a representative small city in China. The study found that UBCE can be significantly affected by BEF such as density, function, and morphology. The BPNN has a good prediction performance on different functions of UBCE, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is stable within 10 %\u201320 %. The prediction results showed that the average value of different functions of UBCE presented an obvious variation. The carbon emission map showed that the high UBCE are mainly clustered in the middle-east and south of the central city of Changxing. By comparison with other studies, the accuracy of this method was proved. This method could be applied to predict carbon emissions of the urban planning scheme. Optimizing the BEF of urban blocks can play key roles in the reduction of carbon emissions and then alleviation of the UHI. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["carbon emissions","different functions","urban blocks","blocks carbon","emissions ubce","factors bef","environment factors","predicting urban","learning method","built environment","accurately based","alleviate urban","average value","back propagation","carbon cities","carbon emission","central city","changxing city","changxing representative","china predicting","cities machine","city china","collected various","density function","effective way","emission map","good prediction","high ubce","islands uhi","key roles","low carbon","mainly clustered","map showed","method back","obvious variation","planning scheme","predict carbon","predict different","propagation neural","proposed machine","reduce ubce","representative small","scheme optimizing","significantly affected","small city","study collected","study found","ubce accurately","ubce based","ubce presented","urban level","various sources","network bpnn","play key","prediction performance","error mape","heat islands","prediction results","results showed","absolute percentage","percentage error","urban planning","mean absolute","neural network","machine learning","urban heat"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["carbon emissions","different functions","urban blocks","blocks carbon","emissions ubce","factors bef","environment factors","predicting urban","learning method","built environment","accurately based","alleviate urban","average value","back propagation","carbon cities","carbon emission","central city","changxing city","changxing representative","china predicting","cities machine","city china","collected various","density function","effective way","emission map","good prediction","heat islands","high ubce","islands uhi","key roles","low carbon","mainly clustered","map showed","method back","obvious variation","planning scheme","play key","predict carbon","predict different","propagation neural","proposed machine","reduce ubce","representative small","results showed","scheme optimizing","significantly affected","small city","study collected","study found","ubce accurately","ubce based","ubce presented","urban level","various sources","absolute percentage","error mape","mean absolute","network bpnn","prediction performance","prediction results","urban heat","percentage error","urban planning","neural network","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["carbon emissions","different functions","urban blocks","blocks carbon","emissions ubce","factors bef","environment factors","learning method","predicting urban","built environment","absolute percentage","accurately based","alleviate urban","average value","back propagation","carbon cities","carbon emission","central city","changxing city","changxing representative","china predicting","cities machine","city china","collected various","density function","effective way","emission map","error mape","good prediction","heat islands","high ubce","islands uhi","key roles","low carbon","mainly clustered","map showed","mean absolute","method back","obvious variation","percentage error","planning scheme","play key","predict carbon","predict different","prediction results","propagation neural","proposed machine","reduce ubce","representative small","results showed","scheme optimizing","significantly affected","small city","study collected","study found","ubce accurately","ubce based","ubce presented","urban level","various sources","network bpnn","prediction performance","urban heat","machine learning","urban planning","neural network"]},{"DocId":441,"Year":2021,"Title":"Learning with self-attention for rental market spatial dynamics in the Atlanta metropolitan area","Abstract":"The rental housing market plays a critical role in the United States real estate market. Prior studies have used various approaches to model housing rent, such as interpolation, hedonic modeling, and machine learning. However, only a few studies have modeled rental prices based on textual data, which provides rich and contextual information about rental properties. In addition, many models, especially deep learning models, use an end-to-end black box for prediction, which hides the decision process. Such models are difficult to interpret and explain the driving factors. This study builds on our previous work, aiming to develop and evaluate rental market spatial dynamics models combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and self-attention mechanism. We compare the performance of the proposed model with our previous models on predicting rental prices in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. We also use techniques from saliency maps to explain the generated model. Results show that the self-attention-based model outperforms our previous models. The saliency map techniques reveal how the model attends to a different part of the textual information. The predicted results reflect the spatial variation of textual information. Such a model offers practical pricing references for homeowners and renters, and spatial patterns for urban planners and stakeholders. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["market spatial","previous models","rental market","rental prices","spatial dynamics","textual information","atlanta georgia","atlanta metropolitan","black box","combining long","contextual information","critical role","decision process","different part","driving factors","dynamics models","especially deep","evaluate rental","generated model","georgia usa","hedonic modeling","housing market","housing rent","interpolation hedonic","long memory","lstm networks","map techniques","market plays","market prior","memory lstm","model attends","model housing","model offers","model results","modeled rental","models combining","models especially","models use","offers practical","plays critical","practical pricing","predicted results","predicting rental","previous work","prices based","pricing references","prior studies","provides rich","rental housing","rental properties","results reflect","saliency map","saliency maps","spatial patterns","spatial variation","states real","study builds","techniques reveal","textual data","united states","use techniques","various approaches","work aiming","estate market","metropolitan area","model outperforms","proposed model","real estate","results show","learning models","urban planners","deep learning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["market spatial","previous models","rental market","rental prices","spatial dynamics","textual information","atlanta georgia","atlanta metropolitan","black box","combining long","contextual information","critical role","decision process","different part","dynamics models","especially deep","estate market","evaluate rental","generated model","georgia usa","hedonic modeling","housing market","housing rent","interpolation hedonic","lstm networks","map techniques","market plays","market prior","metropolitan area","model attends","model housing","model offers","model results","modeled rental","models combining","models use","offers practical","plays critical","practical pricing","predicted results","predicting rental","previous work","prices based","pricing references","prior studies","provides rich","real estate","rental housing","rental properties","results reflect","saliency map","saliency maps","spatial patterns","spatial variation","states real","study builds","techniques reveal","textual data","united states","use techniques","various approaches","work aiming","driving factors","memory lstm","model outperforms","models especially","long memory","learning models","proposed model","urban planners","results show","deep learning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["market spatial","previous models","rental market","rental prices","spatial dynamics","textual information","atlanta georgia","atlanta metropolitan","black box","combining long","contextual information","critical role","decision process","different part","driving factors","dynamics models","especially deep","estate market","evaluate rental","generated model","georgia usa","hedonic modeling","housing market","housing rent","interpolation hedonic","learning models","long memory","lstm networks","map techniques","market plays","market prior","memory lstm","metropolitan area","model attends","model housing","model offers","model results","modeled rental","models combining","models especially","models use","offers practical","plays critical","practical pricing","predicted results","predicting rental","previous work","prices based","pricing references","prior studies","provides rich","real estate","rental housing","rental properties","results reflect","saliency map","saliency maps","spatial patterns","spatial variation","states real","study builds","techniques reveal","textual data","united states","use techniques","various approaches","work aiming","model outperforms","proposed model","urban planners","deep learning","results show","machine learning"]},{"DocId":442,"Year":2021,"Title":"Interpretation of contextual influences with explanatory tools: Travel mode likelihood mapping using GPS trajectories","Abstract":"Past studies have failed to address the spatially and temporally varying impacts of environmental factors regarding the uncertain geographic context problem.

Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["best predictor","fecal sludge","field measurements","filtration time","predictive models","probe readings","process control","settling efficiency","supernatant color","treatment plants","adapting treatment","ammonium concentrations","analytical capacity","analytical measurements","challenging due","characteristics including","cities simple","citywide planning","color supernatant","complexity random","conductivity ec","containment type","control parameters","data expert","data served","easy field","evaluated questionnaire","expert assessments","fill gap","highly variable","image analysis","implementing fecal","including settling","including total","laboratory analysis","lower degree","make predictions","management solutions","normally require","onsite containments","operations accordingly","performance including","ph supernatant","photographs sludge","planning monitoring","predict characteristics","process operations","questionnaire data","readings conductivity","require laboratory","separation performance","simple analytical","simple decision","simple field","single classifier","sludge collected","sludge color","sludge delivered","sludge management","solids ts","time ec","total solids","treatment process","tree models","ts predictive","using cheap","variable adapting","varying complexity","linear regression","models based","regression models","decision tree","models using","random forest"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["best predictor","fecal sludge","field measurements","filtration time","predictive models","probe readings","process control","settling efficiency","supernatant color","treatment plants","adapting treatment","ammonium concentrations","analytical capacity","analytical measurements","challenging due","cities simple","citywide planning","color supernatant","complexity random","conductivity ec","containment type","control parameters","data expert","data served","easy field","evaluated questionnaire","expert assessments","fill gap","highly variable","implementing fecal","including settling","including total","laboratory analysis","lower degree","make predictions","management solutions","models using","normally require","onsite containments","operations accordingly","performance including","ph supernatant","photographs sludge","planning monitoring","predict characteristics","process operations","questionnaire data","readings conductivity","require laboratory","separation performance","simple analytical","simple decision","simple field","single classifier","sludge collected","sludge color","sludge delivered","sludge management","solids ts","time ec","total solids","treatment process","tree models","ts predictive","using cheap","variable adapting","varying complexity","characteristics including","image analysis","models based","regression models","decision tree","linear regression","random forest"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["best predictor","fecal sludge","field measurements","filtration time","predictive models","probe readings","process control","settling efficiency","supernatant color","treatment plants","adapting treatment","ammonium concentrations","analytical capacity","analytical measurements","challenging due","cities simple","citywide planning","color supernatant","complexity random","conductivity ec","containment type","control parameters","data expert","data served","decision tree","easy field","evaluated questionnaire","expert assessments","fill gap","highly variable","image analysis","implementing fecal","including settling","including total","laboratory analysis","linear regression","lower degree","make predictions","management solutions","models based","models using","normally require","onsite containments","operations accordingly","performance including","ph supernatant","photographs sludge","planning monitoring","predict characteristics","process operations","questionnaire data","readings conductivity","regression models","require laboratory","separation performance","simple analytical","simple decision","simple field","single classifier","sludge collected","sludge color","sludge delivered","sludge management","solids ts","time ec","total solids","treatment process","tree models","ts predictive","using cheap","variable adapting","varying complexity","characteristics including","random forest"]},{"DocId":444,"Year":2021,"Title":"Machine learning approach to extract building footprint from high-resolution images: The case study of Makkah, Saudi Arabia","Abstract":"Extracting and identifying building boundaries from high-resolution images have been a hot topic in the field of remote sensing for years.

Hence, every impact on every scale has a significant role. Those properties of the networks are decisive on the global ecosystem, so how they will be modified by climate change needs serious studies. The vast population of the urban areas exerts significant effects on climate change even though they cover a small proportion of the surface of the Earth; however, impacts of urbanization on climate and ecosystems remain inadequately understood. In the meantime, urbanization continues to increase and in 2030, two-thirds of the population is expected to be living in urban areas with an increasing rate in time. It is of great importance to elaborate on the relations between urbanization and climate. In this respect, the use of information technologies with an extensive computational capacity is one of the cornerstones of climate and urban studies. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the automated recognition of patterns from data. The use of machine learning algorithms can bring significant advantages to both understandings and predicting the climate. The computational power with big data, their ability to capture nonlinear behavior, and learn as new data arrive make machine learning a useful tool for understanding climate and developing urban planning.

To this end, we implement the random forest MLA to simulate the intercity corporate networks created by Fortune China 500 firms in mainland China. The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets.

The representations are validated and then tested with a real-world taxi journeys dataset predicting the tips of using a road network of New York.

Compared with low-and-middle resolution remote sensing images, high-resolution remote sensing images are superior in spatial resolution and display of refined spatial details. Yet its problems of spectral heterogeneity and complexity have impeded research of change detection for high-resolution remote sensing images. As generalized machine learning (including deep learning) technologies proceed, the efficiency and accuracy of recognition for ground-object in remote sensing have been substantially improved, providing a new solution for change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images. To this end, this study proposes a refined NCBAs detection method consisting of four parts based on generalized machine learning: (1) pre-processing; (2) candidate NCBAs are obtained by means of bi-temporal building masks acquired by deep learning semantic segmentation, and then registered one by one; (3) rules and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly adopted for classification of NCBAs with high, medium and low confidence; and (4) the final vectors of NCBAs are obtained by post-processing. In addition, area-based and pixel-based methods are adopted for accuracy assessment. Firstly, the proposed method is applied to three groups of GF1 images covering the urban fringe areas of Jinan, whose experimental results are divided into three categories: high, high-medium, and high-medium-low confidence. The results show that NCBAs of high confidence share the highest F1 score and the best overall effect. Therefore, only NCBAs of high confidence are considered to be the final detection result by this method. Specifically, in NCBAs detection for three groups GF1 images in Jinan, the mean Recall of area-based and pixel-based assessment methods reach around 77% and 91%, respectively, the mean Pixel Accuracy (PA) 88% and 92%, and the mean F1 82% and 91%, confirming the effectiveness of this method on GF1. Similarly, the proposed method is applied to two groups of ZY302 images in Xi\u2019an and Kunming. The scores of F1 for two groups of ZY302 images are also above 90% respectively, confirming the effectiveness of this method on ZY302. It can be concluded that adoption of area registration improves registration efficiency, and the joint use of prior rules and SVM classifier with probability features could avoid over and missing detection for NCBAs. In practical applications, this method is contributive to automatic NCBAs detection from high-resolution remote sensing images. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Within the field of urban studies, an old question worth revisiting with these new technologies is how to best trace the spatial boundaries that circumscribe a place or location to explore non-work activity. In this study, we explore a data-driven definition of places as units of analysis that can be used to explore non-work activity in Singapore. Such a definition of place characterizes an urban space in terms of its concentration of activity and the topology of the built environment\u2013features that are especially important to urban planners. We utilize available smartphone data to develop a systematic framework to identify locations with a concentrated human presence. Using a cylinder moving over a grid representing Singapore, we scan aggregated smartphones locational requests (by time and cell), identifying areas with atypical high concentrations at a given time. Our tool identified 93 places with a concentrated human presence. Direct observation of six of these places at the selected times in conjunction with additional transportation and population data indicated that the topology of commercial establishments provided a strong approximation of non-work activity at a given time and place. Having established the relevance of commercial establishments in approximating non-work activity, then points-of-interest data within the 93 derived places are used to propose a typology of commercial patches, based on their spatial configuration. Nine metrics of the geometry and topology of patches of establishments, such as compacity and their dependence on proximity to shopping malls, were developed. These combined variables revealed more temporal and spatial variety within locations than had previously been recognized. The most popular places for non-work activity were densely configured with various commercial sub-spaces or patches appealing to different lifestyles and income groups. This study suggests that a location\/place can be best defined as a highly detailed, multi-faceted, and always evolving area of activity rather than as a fixed location with temporal and unmovable boundaries. Suggesting a dynamic redefinition of location\/place that builds on other recent work, this work offers potential contributions to locational models for non-work activity. \u00a9 The Author(s)

It will play a vital role to reduce the various crimes i.e. (children kidnapping, drug\/alcohol smuggling, traffic misconduct, weapons smuggling, sexual misconduct and mission of country-related crime, etc.) at the border of the cities as well as countries. Vehicle detection and counting have various other applications like traffic management, parking allotment, tracking the rescue vehicle in hill areas, digital watermarking, vehicle tracking at the toll plaza and urban planning, etc. However, vehicle detection and counting task are very challenging and difficult because of the complex background, the small size of the vehicle, other similar visual appearance objects, distance, etc. Till now, traditional methodology introduced several robust algorithms which has limitations while extracting the features from aerial images. Recently, deep learning-based algorithms introduced and the outcomes of these algorithms are robust for such kind of applications in the area of computer vision. But accuracy of these algorithms is not optimized in aerial images because the deep learning algorithm required a huge amount of data to train the machine and the size of the object in aerial images is also too small. All these factors affecting the efficiency of the real-time device.

In the face of challenges brought about by the demographic transition, there is an urgent need to improve the accuracy of urban land-use mappings to more efficiently inform about urban planning processes. Decision-makers rely on accurate urban mappings to properly assess current plans and to develop new ones. This study investigates the effects of including conventional spectral signatures acquired by different sensors on the classification of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds using multiple feature spaces. The proposed method applied three machine learning algorithms\u2014ML (Maximum Likelihood), SVM (Support Vector Machines), and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network)\u2014to classify LiDAR point clouds of a residential urban area after being geo-registered to aerial photos. The overall classification accuracy passed 97%, with height as the only geometric feature in the classifying space.

The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is \u221215.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model. An increasingly precise simulation can determine the potential increase area and quantity of urban land, providing a basis to judge the layout of urban land use for urban planners. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Indeed, historical maps are often the only source of information when dealing with historical scenarios or multi-temporal (4D) digital representations. The paper presents a methodology to derive 4D building models in the level of detail 1 (LoD1), inferring missing height information through machine learning techniques. The aim is to realise 4D LoD1 buildings for geospatial analyses and visualisation, valorising historical data, and urban studies. Several machine learning regression techniques are analysed and employed for deriving missing height data from digitised multi-temporal maps. The implemented method relies on geometric, neighbours, and categorical attributes for height prediction. Derived elevation data are then used for 4D building reconstructions, offering multitemporal versions of the considered urban scenarios. Various evaluation metrics are also presented for tackling the common issue of lack of ground-truth information within historical data. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012\u20132020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments. \u00a9 2021 Milusheva et al.

data with material consumption analysis within the Hanoi Province (Vietnam). Urban expansion is investigated with the use of landcover maps for the period 1975\u20132020 derived from satellite. During this period, artificial surfaces and agricultural areas have increased by 11.6% and 15.5%, re-spectively, while forests have decreased by 26.7%. We have used publicly available datasets to calculate and forecast the construction materials consumption and measure its statistical correla-tion with urban expansion between 2007 and 2018. Our results show that official figures for sand consumption are currently underestimated, and that by 2030, steel and sand and gravel consumption will increase even further by three and two times, respectively. Our analysis uses a new method to assess urban development and associated impacts by combining socio-economic and Earth Observation datasets. The analysis can provide evidence, underpin decision-making by au-thorities, policymakers, urban planners and sustainability experts, as well as support the development of informed strategies for resource consumption. It can also provide important information for identifying areas of land conservation and ecological greenways during urban planning. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus.

The economic contribution of the transport sector represents 5&#x0025; of the GDP in Europe and costs an average of US &#x0024;482.05 billion in the United States. These figures indicate the rapid rise of industrial cities and the urgent need to move from traditional cities to smart cities. This article provides a survey of different approaches and technologies such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that leverage communication technologies to help maintain road users safe while driving, as well as support autonomous mobility through the optimization of control systems. The role of ITS is strengthened when combined with accurate artificial intelligence models that are built to optimize urban planning, analyze crowd behavior and predict traffic conditions. AI-driven ITS is becoming possible thanks to the existence of a large volume of mobility data generated by billions of users through their use of new technologies and online social media. The optimization of urban planning enhances vehicle routing capabilities and solves traffic congestion problems, as discussed in this paper. From an ecological perspective, we discuss the measures and incentives provided to foster the use of mobility systems. We also underline the role of the political will in promoting open data in the transport sector, considered as an essential ingredient for developing technological solutions necessary for cities to become healthier and more sustainable.

Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["climate resilience","planning responses","planning support","support systems","academic literature","address climate","analysis concludes","appropriate planning","becoming reality","chapter aims","climate pressures","conducting analysis","confirms difficulties","critical review","documents continue","emerging body","enable planning","extract trends","fixed scenarios","full range","improve flexibility","improve urban","improving pss","increasing demand","inform policies","infrastructure drivers","infrastructure systems","integrated thinking","key finding","long run","make headway","multiple infrastructure","places strong","planning continues","planning timeframes","practice documents","practice literature","pressures infrastructure","previous research","pss due","pss enable","require integrated","research agenda","research confirms","research priorities","resilience critical","resilience planning","responses key","sector strategies","single sector","spatial plans","strategies practice","strong focus","support selection","systems pss","temporal aspects","understanding research","urban resilience","deeper understanding","climate change","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["climate resilience","planning responses","planning support","support systems","academic literature","address climate","analysis concludes","appropriate planning","becoming reality","chapter aims","climate pressures","conducting analysis","confirms difficulties","critical review","deeper understanding","documents continue","emerging body","enable planning","extract trends","fixed scenarios","full range","improve flexibility","improve urban","improving pss","increasing demand","inform policies","infrastructure drivers","infrastructure systems","integrated thinking","key finding","long run","make headway","multiple infrastructure","places strong","planning continues","planning timeframes","practice documents","practice literature","pressures infrastructure","previous research","pss due","pss enable","require integrated","research agenda","research confirms","research priorities","resilience critical","resilience planning","responses key","sector strategies","single sector","spatial plans","strategies practice","strong focus","support selection","systems pss","temporal aspects","understanding research","urban resilience","climate change","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["climate resilience","planning responses","planning support","support systems","academic literature","address climate","analysis concludes","appropriate planning","becoming reality","chapter aims","climate pressures","conducting analysis","confirms difficulties","critical review","deeper understanding","documents continue","emerging body","enable planning","extract trends","fixed scenarios","full range","improve flexibility","improve urban","improving pss","increasing demand","inform policies","infrastructure drivers","infrastructure systems","integrated thinking","key finding","long run","make headway","multiple infrastructure","places strong","planning continues","planning timeframes","practice documents","practice literature","pressures infrastructure","previous research","pss due","pss enable","require integrated","research agenda","research confirms","research priorities","resilience critical","resilience planning","responses key","sector strategies","single sector","spatial plans","strategies practice","strong focus","support selection","systems pss","temporal aspects","understanding research","urban resilience","climate change","urban planning"]},{"DocId":468,"Year":2021,"Title":"An Intelligent Tree Planning Approach Using Location-Based Social Networks\u00a0Data","Abstract":"How do we make sure that all citizens in a city have access to enough green space?

As optional tree planting sites and financial resources are limited, determining the best planting site can be formulated as an optimization problem with constraints. Can we locate these sites based on the popularity of nearby venues? How can we ensure that we include groups of people who tend to spend time in tree deprived areas? Currently, tree location sites are chosen based on criteria from spatial-visual, physical and biological, and functional categories. As these criteria do not give any insights into which citizens are benefiting from the tree placement, we propose new data-driven tree planting policies that take socio-cultural aspects as represented by the citizens\u2019 behavior into account. We combine a Location Based Social Network (LBSN) mobility data set with tree location data sets, both of New York City and Paris, as a case study.

The ability to track and forecast the evolution of the physical characteristics of coastal areas over time is an important factor in coastal development, risk mitigation and overall coastal zone management. Traditional bathymetry measurements are obtained using echo-sounding techniques which are considered expensive and not always possible due to various complexities. Remote sensing tools such as satellite imagery can be used to estimate bathymetry using incident wave signatures and inversion models such as physical models of waves. In this work, we present two novel approaches to bathymetry estimation using deep learning and we compare the two proposed methods in terms of accuracy, computational costs, and applicability to real data. We show that deep learning is capable of accurately estimating ocean depth in a variety of simulated cases which offers a new approach for bathymetry estimation and a novel application for deep learning. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["bathymetry estimation","bathymetry using","coastal development","deep learning","using deep","accuracy computational","accurately estimating","bathymetry measurements","coastal areas","coastal zone","complexities remote","computational costs","considered expensive","derived bathymetry","development risk","different issues","estimate bathymetry","estimating ocean","estimation using","extreme storm","facing different","important factor","incident wave","including natural","inversion models","learning coastal","management traditional","natural disasters","novel application","novel approaches","obtained using","ocean depth","offers new","overall coastal","physical models","possible due","present two","proposed methods","real data","risk mitigation","satellite derived","sensing tools","simulated cases","storm events","traditional bathymetry","two novel","using incident","using techniques","various complexities","wave signatures","zone management","issues including","physical characteristics","two proposed","new approach","satellite imagery","remote sensing","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["bathymetry estimation","bathymetry using","coastal development","deep learning","using deep","accuracy computational","accurately estimating","bathymetry measurements","coastal areas","coastal zone","complexities remote","computational costs","considered expensive","derived bathymetry","development risk","different issues","estimate bathymetry","estimating ocean","estimation using","extreme storm","facing different","important factor","incident wave","including natural","inversion models","learning coastal","management traditional","natural disasters","novel application","novel approaches","obtained using","ocean depth","offers new","overall coastal","physical models","possible due","present two","proposed methods","real data","risk mitigation","satellite derived","sensing tools","simulated cases","storm events","traditional bathymetry","two novel","using incident","using techniques","various complexities","wave signatures","zone management","issues including","physical characteristics","two proposed","new approach","satellite imagery","remote sensing","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["bathymetry estimation","bathymetry using","coastal development","deep learning","using deep","accuracy computational","accurately estimating","bathymetry measurements","coastal areas","coastal zone","complexities remote","computational costs","considered expensive","derived bathymetry","development risk","different issues","estimate bathymetry","estimating ocean","estimation using","extreme storm","facing different","important factor","incident wave","including natural","inversion models","learning coastal","management traditional","natural disasters","new approach","novel application","novel approaches","obtained using","ocean depth","offers new","overall coastal","physical characteristics","physical models","possible due","present two","proposed methods","real data","risk mitigation","satellite derived","sensing tools","simulated cases","storm events","traditional bathymetry","two novel","two proposed","using incident","using techniques","various complexities","wave signatures","zone management","issues including","satellite imagery","remote sensing","urban planning"]},{"DocId":470,"Year":2021,"Title":"Evolution of historical urban landscape with computer vision and machine learning: A case study of Berlin","Abstract":"Previous studies of historical urban landscape usually focused on the qualitative analysis of city planning and development with the social, economic, and political context, but overlooked quantitative analysis from human perceptions. In this study, we objectively measured the seemingly subjective qualities of the eye-level urban landscape perceptions with computer vision and machine learning technologies. We then explored correlations between the measured perceptual qualities and characteristics from the historical context. We chose Berlin as a research object because it is a capital city that owns a rich history of division and reunification, as well as a variety of residential zones built at different periods. We extracted 30 street features from the 150,000 Google Street View Imagery (SVI) dataset with a computer vision algorithm and evaluated eight perceptual qualities including typology, order, ecology, enclosure, aesthetics, richness, accessibility and scale with a machine learning method. Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning

Techniques: A Case Study in Hilla City, Babylon Governorate, Iraq","Abstract":"High rate of urbanization coupled with population growth has led to unexpected land use and land cover changes in Hilla city, which is located in the Babylon governorate of Iraq. Understanding and quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban land use and land cover changes, as well as the driving factors behind them, are therefore vital in order to design appropriate policies and monitoring mechanisms to govern urban growth. This study analyzes land use and land cover changes over Hilla city through remote sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques. IKONOS satellite imagery from years 2000, 2005, and 2011 was collected and pre-processed using ENVI and ArcGIS, which then goes through an object-based supervised image classification stage to generate land use and land cover maps. The classification is performed using the statistical machine learning algorithm, SVM (Support Vector Machine). The confusion matrix and kappa coefficients are used to evaluate the overall accuracy of the results. The statistical results obtained enable assessment of class changes from years 2000 to 2011 and also identify the gain and loss of the built-up areas in relation to other land cover classes. The results also allow assessment of the spatial trend of these built-up areas. Ultimately, forecasts can be made to predict expected future class changes in 2026 and 2036. Generally, the results of this study show increased expansions of built-up areas, i.e., from 8.14% in 2000 to 14.53% in 2005 and up to 18.36% in 2011. All this was at the expense of bare land areas. Simultaneously, there was an increased expansion of vegetation\/agricultural land area, specifically from 36.14% in 2000 to 41.71% in 2005 and 45.13% in 2011. The spatial trend also shows that the growth of built-up areas is focused in the southwestern part of Hilla city. In all, we foresee that the findings of this study can provide a good visual resource for decision-makers to perform more efficient urban planning. \u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland

geospatial big data: Progress, challenges, and opportunities","Abstract":"Urban land use information that reflects socio-economic functions and human activities is critically essential for urban planning, landscape design, environmental management, health promotion, and biodiversity conservation. Land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) have facilitated a wide spectrum of applications and further triggered new opportunities in urban studies. New and improved Earth observations, algorithms, and advanced products for extracting thematic urban information, in association with emerging social sensing big data and auxiliary crowdsourcing datasets, all together offer great potentials to mapping fine-resolution EULUC from regional to global scales. Here we review the advances of EULUC mapping research and practices in terms of their data, methods, and applications. Based on the historical retrospect, we summarize the challenges and limitations of current EULUC studies regarding sample collection, mixed land use problem, data and model generalization, and large-scale mapping efforts. Finally, we propose and discuss future opportunities, including cross-scale mapping, optimal integration of multi-source features, global sample libraries from crowdsourcing approaches, advanced machine learning and ensembled classification strategy, open portals for data visualization and sharing, multi-temporal mapping of EULUC change, and implications in urban environmental studies, to facilitate multi-scale fine-resolution EULUC mapping research. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

Although they perform important functions, research focuses on large cities and metropolises while marginalizing small cities, the study of which is of great importance to progress in social sciences, geography, and urban planning. The main goal of this paper was to verify the impact of selected socio-economic factors on the share of built-up areas in 665 small Polish cities in 2019. Data from the Database of Topographic Objects (BDOT), Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from 2015 and 2019, and Local Data Bank by Statistics Poland form 2019 were used in the research. A machine learning segmentation procedure was used to obtain the data on the occurrence of built-up areas. Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explain spatially varying impact of factors related to population, spatial and economic development, and living standards on the share of built-up areas in the area of small cities. Significant association was found between the population density and the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities studied. The influence of the other socio-economic factors examined, related to the spatial and economic development of the cities and the quality of life of the inhabitants, showed great regional variation. The results also indicated that the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities under study is a result of the conditions under which they were established and developed throughout their existence, and not only of the socio-economic factors affecting them at present. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The model was tested in Amol City, Iran, a data-scarce city in an ungauged area which is prone to severe flood inundation events and currently lacks flood prevention infrastructure. Performance of the hybridized model was compared with that of a standalone MLPNN model, random forest and boosted regression trees. Area under the curve, efficiency, true skill statistic, Matthews correlation coefficient, misclassification rate, sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate model performance. In validation, the MultiB-MLPNN model showed the best predictive performance. The hybridized MultiB-MLPNN model is thus useful for generating realistic flood susceptibility maps for data-scarce urban areas. The maps can be used to develop risk-reduction measures to protect urban areas from devastating floods, particularly where available data are insufficient to support physically based hydrological or hydraulic models. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

It has been a very significant research topic with high social impact, which can be widely applied to emergency management, traffic regulation, and urban planning. In particular, by meshing a large urban area to a number of fine-grained mesh-grids, citywide crowd and traffic information in a continuous time period can be represented with 4D tensor (Timestep, Height, Width, Channel). Based on this idea, a series of methods have been proposed to address grid-based prediction for citywide crowd and traffic. In this study, we revisit the density and in-out flow prediction problem and publish a new aggregated human mobility dataset generated from a real-world smartphone application. Comparing with the existing ones, our dataset holds several advantages including large mesh-grid number, fine-grained mesh size, and high user sample. Towards this large-scale crowd dataset, we propose a novel deep learning model called DeepCrowd by designing pyramid architectures and high-dimensional attention mechanism based on Convolutional LSTM. Lastly, thorough and comprehensive performance evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DeepCrowd comparing to multiple state-of-the-art methods.

Recent advances in computing performance of urban layouts in real-time allow for new paradigms of performance-driven design. As beneficial as utilizing multiple layers of urban data may be, it can also create a challenge in interpreting and operationalizing data. This paper presents an integrated computational framework to measure sustainability, operationalize and interpret the urban form's performance data using generative design methods, novel performance simulations, and machine learning predictions. The performance data is clustered into three pillars of sustainability: social, environmental, and economical, and it is followed with the performance space exploration, which assists in extracting knowledge and actionable rules of thumb. A significant advantage of the framework is that it can be used as a discussion table in participatory planning processes since it could be easily adapted to interactive environments. \u00a9 2021 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["computational framework","integrated computational","performance data","urban form","urban data","actionable rules","computing performance","create challenge","data operationalization","data using","discussion table","easily adapted","extracting knowledge","form performance","interactive environments","learning predictions","measure sustainability","measuring sustainability","methods novel","multiple layers","novel performance","operationalizing data","participatory planning","performance simulations","performance space","planning processes","rapid urbanization","significant advantage","social environmental","space exploration","sustainability operationalize","sustainability social","sustainable development","three pillars","thumb significant","using generative","utilizing multiple","design methods","new paradigms","sustainable urban","urban development","urban layouts","generative design","recent advances","paper presents","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["computational framework","integrated computational","performance data","urban data","urban form","actionable rules","computing performance","create challenge","data operationalization","data using","discussion table","easily adapted","extracting knowledge","form performance","interactive environments","learning predictions","measure sustainability","measuring sustainability","methods novel","multiple layers","new paradigms","novel performance","operationalizing data","participatory planning","performance simulations","performance space","planning processes","rapid urbanization","significant advantage","social environmental","space exploration","sustainability operationalize","sustainability social","sustainable development","three pillars","thumb significant","urban layouts","using generative","utilizing multiple","design methods","recent advances","sustainable urban","urban development","generative design","paper presents","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["computational framework","integrated computational","performance data","urban data","urban form","actionable rules","computing performance","create challenge","data operationalization","data using","discussion table","easily adapted","extracting knowledge","form performance","interactive environments","learning predictions","measure sustainability","measuring sustainability","methods novel","multiple layers","new paradigms","novel performance","operationalizing data","participatory planning","performance simulations","performance space","planning processes","rapid urbanization","recent advances","significant advantage","social environmental","space exploration","sustainability operationalize","sustainability social","sustainable development","sustainable urban","three pillars","thumb significant","urban development","urban layouts","using generative","utilizing multiple","design methods","generative design","paper presents","machine learning"]},{"DocId":481,"Year":2021,"Title":"Virtual design of urban planning based on GIS big data and machine learning","Abstract":"In order to build a virtual urban planning model and improve the effect of urban planning, this paper builds a virtual urban planning design model based on GIS big data technology and machine learning algorithms, and proposes a solution that combines multiple features. With the development of polarized SAR in the direction of high resolution, a single feature often cannot fully express the detailed information of ground objects, resulting in poor classification results and low accuracy. The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score.

This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata\u00a0model\u00a0uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical\u00a0flood\u00a0hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations. Our work shows that coproduced scenarios, when grounded with historical and emerging data, can provide paths that increase resilience to weather hazards as well as enhancing ecosystem services provided to citizens. \u00a9 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","urban futures","climate change","use change","cellular automata","ancillary data","automata approach","change rules","cities cities","cities grapple","climate risks","combine historical","complex systems","complicates urban","coproduced scenarios","coproduced urban","coupling complicates","data like","data sources","deeply coupled","develop set","ecosystem services","emerging data","enhancing ecosystem","envision urban","examine climate","existing road","flood hazards","future scenarios","futures scenarios","hazards showcasing","historical flood","improve livability","increase resilience","intense severe","land cover","leverage wide","like existing","likely impact","local coproduced","model uses","models leverage","modified according","natural features","numerical models","present cellular","probabilistic land","provide paths","resulting land","road systems","services provided","severe weather","social ecological","stakeholder expectations","stakeholder priorities","tax assessments","technological processes","urban fabric","urban future","use development","use scenarios","uses historical","weather events","weather hazards","wide array","work shows","historical land","local land","satellite imagery","automata model","modeling urban","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","urban futures","climate change","use change","cellular automata","ancillary data","automata approach","change rules","cities cities","cities grapple","climate risks","combine historical","complex systems","complicates urban","coproduced scenarios","coproduced urban","coupling complicates","data like","data sources","deeply coupled","develop set","ecosystem services","emerging data","enhancing ecosystem","envision urban","examine climate","existing road","flood hazards","future scenarios","futures scenarios","hazards showcasing","historical flood","historical land","improve livability","increase resilience","intense severe","leverage wide","like existing","likely impact","local coproduced","model uses","models leverage","modified according","natural features","numerical models","present cellular","probabilistic land","provide paths","resulting land","road systems","satellite imagery","services provided","severe weather","social ecological","stakeholder expectations","stakeholder priorities","tax assessments","technological processes","urban fabric","urban future","use development","use scenarios","uses historical","weather events","weather hazards","wide array","work shows","land cover","local land","automata model","modeling urban","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","urban futures","climate change","use change","ancillary data","automata approach","change rules","cities cities","cities grapple","climate risks","combine historical","complex systems","complicates urban","coproduced scenarios","coproduced urban","coupling complicates","data like","data sources","deeply coupled","develop set","ecosystem services","emerging data","enhancing ecosystem","envision urban","examine climate","existing road","flood hazards","future scenarios","futures scenarios","hazards showcasing","historical flood","historical land","improve livability","increase resilience","intense severe","land cover","leverage wide","like existing","likely impact","local coproduced","model uses","models leverage","modified according","natural features","numerical models","present cellular","probabilistic land","provide paths","resulting land","road systems","satellite imagery","services provided","severe weather","social ecological","stakeholder expectations","stakeholder priorities","tax assessments","technological processes","urban fabric","urban future","use development","use scenarios","uses historical","weather events","weather hazards","wide array","work shows","cellular automata","local land","modeling urban","automata model","urban planning"]},{"DocId":485,"Year":2021,"Title":"Analyzing the spatiotemporal uncertainty in urbanization predictions","Abstract":"With the availability of computational resources, geographical information systems, and remote sensing data, urban growth modeling has become a viable tool for predicting urbanization of cities and towns, regions, and nations around the world. This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, urban growth models often discard the spatiotemporal uncertainties in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyzed the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on a widely applied cellular automata model known as the SLEUTH CA and the other one based on a previously published machine learning framework. We selected these two models because they are complementary, the first is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the second is more data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori knowledge or bias. To test our methodology, we chose the cities of Jiaxing and Lishui in China because they are representative of new town planning policies and have different characteristics in terms of land extension, geographical conditions, growth rates, and economic drivers. We focused on the spatiotemporal uncertainty, understood as the inherent doubt in the predictions of where and when will a piece of land become urban, using the concepts of certainty area in space and certainty area in time. The proposed analyses in this paper aim to contribute to better urban planning exercises, and they can be extended to other cities worldwide. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN-based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation. In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labeling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mean Intersection over Union of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pretrained model of UVid-Net on urban street scene by fine tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["semantic segmentation","video semantic","aerial videos","temporal information","cnn architecture","proposed architecture","segmentation methods","uav aerial","uav video","accurate localization","additional module","architecture embeds","based cnn","changes urban","computational overhead","computing temporal","consistent labeling","decision support","embedding temporal","embeds temporal","enhanced based","enhanced semantic","environmental changes","existing video","extended manipaluavid","final layer","fine tuning","incorporating temporal","information semantic","manipaluavid dataset","mean intersection","metric mean","monitoring environmental","optical flow","performance metric","pretrained model","produced promising","proposed research","proposed work","quantitatively evaluated","research work","significantly greater","street scene","support systems","temporal dynamics","temporally consistent","vehicle uav","work modifies","work produced","class labels","image semantic","segmentation algorithms","urban street","aerial vehicle","decision making","promising results","unmanned aerial","disaster management","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["semantic segmentation","video semantic","aerial videos","temporal information","cnn architecture","proposed architecture","segmentation methods","uav aerial","uav video","accurate localization","additional module","architecture embeds","based cnn","changes urban","computational overhead","computing temporal","consistent labeling","decision support","embedding temporal","embeds temporal","enhanced based","enhanced semantic","environmental changes","existing video","extended manipaluavid","final layer","fine tuning","incorporating temporal","information semantic","manipaluavid dataset","mean intersection","metric mean","monitoring environmental","optical flow","performance metric","pretrained model","produced promising","proposed research","proposed work","quantitatively evaluated","research work","significantly greater","street scene","support systems","temporal dynamics","temporally consistent","urban street","vehicle uav","work modifies","work produced","aerial vehicle","class labels","image semantic","segmentation algorithms","decision making","promising results","unmanned aerial","disaster management","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["semantic segmentation","video semantic","aerial videos","temporal information","cnn architecture","proposed architecture","segmentation methods","uav aerial","uav video","accurate localization","additional module","aerial vehicle","architecture embeds","based cnn","changes urban","class labels","computational overhead","computing temporal","consistent labeling","decision support","embedding temporal","embeds temporal","enhanced based","enhanced semantic","environmental changes","existing video","extended manipaluavid","final layer","fine tuning","image semantic","incorporating temporal","information semantic","manipaluavid dataset","mean intersection","metric mean","monitoring environmental","optical flow","performance metric","pretrained model","produced promising","proposed research","proposed work","quantitatively evaluated","research work","segmentation algorithms","significantly greater","street scene","support systems","temporal dynamics","temporally consistent","urban street","vehicle uav","work modifies","work produced","decision making","disaster management","promising results","unmanned aerial","urban planning"]},{"DocId":487,"Year":2021,"Title":"AVI 2020 Workshop on Road Mapping Infrastructures for Artificial Intelligence Supporting Advanced Visual Big Data Analysis, AVI-BDA 2020 and 2nd Italian Workshop on Visualization and Visual Analytics, ITAVIS 2020","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 14 papers.

The nighttime light (NTL) datasets have been widely utilized to estimate the socio-economic parameters. However, the precision of the published datasets was too coarse to meet related issues such as flood losses assessment, urban planning, and epidemiological studies. The present study calibrated gross domestic product (GDP), population (POP), electric consumption (EC), and urban build-up area (B-A) at 100 m resolution for 45 cities of China in 2018 using Luojia1-01 NTL datasets via random forest (RF) as well as geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The linear regression (LR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) methods were selected for comparison with GWR and RF models. Besides, the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) was chosen for comparison with Luojia1-01. The ten-folded cross-validation (CV) has been used for evaluating accuracy at county and city scales. Finally, the distribution maps of socio-economic parameters were illustrated and some findings were obtained. First, the validation results revealed that the calibration at the city-scale outperformed the county or district scale. Second, the precision of the Luojia1-01 NTL dataset surpassed the NPP-VIIRS NTL dataset on the same administrative scale except for some specific situations. Third, the precision of the simulation for the gross domestic product (GDP) is the highest than the others, followed by electric consumption (EC), build-up area (B-A), and population (POP). Fourth, the optimum model varied according to the socio-economic parameters. Fifth, the distribution of socio-economic parameters exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity.

cognition","Abstract":"Historically, the dynamic between philosophy of artificial intelligence and its practical application has been essential for the development of both, and thus the encounter between theory of AI and architectural\/urban theory should be a site of considerable productivity. However, in many ways, it is not. This is due to two primary factors, one arising from each side of this encounter. First, legacies of overly-anthropomorphic models of AI permeate design discourses, where issues of how well AI can be constrained to social issues of philosophy of mind exclude more foundational and cross-cultural questions about artificial intelligence as material process in the physical world that could inform new philosophical insights. Concurrently, the mobilization of investment in \u201cSmart Cities\u201d discourses dominates the space of application of AI at urban scale in ways that prematurely fixes solutions in the skeuomorphic image of architectural and urban conventions. To break this impasse, we held a series of think-tanks, workshops, and design charettes that brought together leading figures in philosophy of artificial intelligence, urban design, and commercial AI platforms. The goal was to re-think from first principles how alternative philosophical models of AI as a distributed, discontinuous, landscape-scale technology in a direct encounter with the applications in contexts of ecological sensing, automation\u2019s impact on urban form, and issues of algorithmic governance. The design brief for this research establishes a generative framework for conceiving how embedded machine sensing and intelligence is already changing urban form (but unrecognized) and could change it in the future (based on more appropriate design projections). The framework focuses on issues of urban zoning and architectural programming, data modeling and governance, platform cognition and design, and how these inform shifts in dynamics of public and private institutions. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["platform cognition","urban form","artificial intelligence","ai permeate","ai platforms","ai urbanism","algorithmic governance","alternative philosophical","appropriate design","architectural programming","automation impact","changing urban","cities discourses","cognition historically","commercial ai","considerable productivity","data modeling","design brief","design charettes","design discourses","design framework","design projections","direct encounter","discontinuous technology","discourses dominates","distributed discontinuous","ecological sensing","embedded machine","establishes generative","fixes solutions","framework focuses","future based","generative framework","governance platform","governance program","held series","inform new","inform shifts","insights concurrently","intelligence urban","leading figures","machine sensing","material process","mind exclude","new philosophical","permeate design","philosophical insights","philosophical models","physical world","practical application","prematurely fixes","primary factors","private institutions","programming data","research establishes","sensing automation","skeuomorphic image","social issues","two primary","urban conventions","urban scale","urban zoning","urbanism design","urban design","smart cities"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["platform cognition","urban form","artificial intelligence","ai permeate","ai platforms","ai urbanism","algorithmic governance","alternative philosophical","appropriate design","architectural programming","automation impact","changing urban","cities discourses","cognition historically","commercial ai","considerable productivity","data modeling","design brief","design charettes","design discourses","design framework","design projections","direct encounter","discontinuous technology","discourses dominates","distributed discontinuous","ecological sensing","embedded machine","establishes generative","fixes solutions","framework focuses","future based","generative framework","governance platform","governance program","held series","inform new","inform shifts","insights concurrently","intelligence urban","leading figures","machine sensing","material process","mind exclude","new philosophical","permeate design","philosophical insights","philosophical models","physical world","practical application","prematurely fixes","primary factors","private institutions","programming data","research establishes","sensing automation","skeuomorphic image","social issues","two primary","urban conventions","urban scale","urban zoning","urbanism design","urban design","smart cities"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["platform cognition","urban form","artificial intelligence","ai permeate","ai platforms","ai urbanism","algorithmic governance","alternative philosophical","appropriate design","architectural programming","automation impact","changing urban","cities discourses","cognition historically","commercial ai","considerable productivity","data modeling","design brief","design charettes","design discourses","design framework","design projections","direct encounter","discontinuous technology","discourses dominates","distributed discontinuous","ecological sensing","embedded machine","establishes generative","fixes solutions","framework focuses","future based","generative framework","governance platform","governance program","held series","inform new","inform shifts","insights concurrently","intelligence urban","leading figures","machine sensing","material process","mind exclude","new philosophical","permeate design","philosophical insights","philosophical models","physical world","practical application","prematurely fixes","primary factors","private institutions","programming data","research establishes","sensing automation","skeuomorphic image","social issues","two primary","urban conventions","urban scale","urban zoning","urbanism design","urban design","smart cities"]},{"DocId":490,"Year":2021,"Title":"Evaluating the Performance of Reinforcement Learning Signalling Strategies for Sustainable Urban Road Networks","Abstract":"Smart Cities promise to their residents, quick journeys in a clean and sustainable environment. Despite, the benefits accrued by the introduction of traffic management solutions (e.g. improved travel times, maximisation of throughput, etc.), these solutions usually fall short on ensuring the environmental sustainability around the implementation areas. This is because the environmental dimension (e.g. vehicle emissions) is usually absent from the optimisation methodologies adopted for traffic management strategies. Nonetheless, since environmental performance corresponds as a primary goal of contemporary mobility planning, solutions that can guarantee air quality are significant. This study presents an advanced Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) signal control framework, able to incorporate environmental considerations into the core of signal optimisation processes. More specifically, a highly flexible Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm has been developed in order to identify efficient but -more importantly- environmentally friendly signal control strategies. The methodology is deployed on a large-scale micro-simulation environment able to realistically represent urban traffic conditions. Alternative signal control strategies are designed, applied, and evaluated against their achieved traffic efficiency and environmental footprint. Based on the results obtained from the application of the methodology on a core part of the road urban network of Nicosia, Cyprus the best strategy achieved a 4.8% increase of the network throughput, 17.7% decrease of the average queue length and a remarkable 34.2% decrease of delay while considerably reduced the CO emissions by 8.1%. The encouraging results showcase ability of RL-based traffic signal controlling to ensure improved air-quality conditions for the residents of dense urban areas. \u00a9 2021, The Editor(s) (if

important for promoting urban health, yet costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-enabled approach to predicting the prevalence of six common non-communicable chronic diseases at the census tract level. We apply our approach to the City of Austin and show that our method can yield fairly accurate predictions. In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes. By analyzing where the most significant discrepancies between the predicted and the actual values are, we will also be ready to identify areas of best practice and areas in need of greater investment or policy intervention. \u00a9 2020","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["health outcomes","accurate predictions","actual values","analysis suggests","approach estimating","best practice","best predictive","chronic diseases","city officials","common chronic","complementary data","different machine","estimating health","evaluate future","fairly accurate","future scenarios","greater investment","helps improve","historical records","identify areas","information distilled","mapping health","models performance","models yielded","neighborhood conditions","neighborhood disorder","neighborhood scale","officials evaluate","outcomes machine","physical environment","policy intervention","predictive models","predictor variables","present approach","significant discrepancies","six common","social environment","socioeconomic variables","strongest predictors","urban health","useful complementary","yield fairly","census tract","eight different","promoting urban","service requests","tract level","machine learning","data source","learning approach","learning models","learning algorithms"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["health outcomes","machine learning","accurate predictions","actual values","analysis suggests","approach estimating","best practice","best predictive","census tract","chronic diseases","city officials","common chronic","complementary data","data source","different machine","estimating health","evaluate future","fairly accurate","future scenarios","greater investment","helps improve","historical records","identify areas","information distilled","learning models","mapping health","models performance","models yielded","neighborhood conditions","neighborhood disorder","neighborhood scale","officials evaluate","outcomes machine","physical environment","policy intervention","predictor variables","present approach","service requests","significant discrepancies","six common","social environment","socioeconomic variables","strongest predictors","tract level","urban health","useful complementary","yield fairly","eight different","learning approach","predictive models","promoting urban","learning algorithms"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["health outcomes","machine learning","accurate predictions","actual values","analysis suggests","approach estimating","best practice","best predictive","census tract","chronic diseases","city officials","common chronic","complementary data","data source","different machine","eight different","estimating health","evaluate future","fairly accurate","future scenarios","greater investment","helps improve","historical records","identify areas","information distilled","learning models","mapping health","models performance","models yielded","neighborhood conditions","neighborhood disorder","neighborhood scale","officials evaluate","outcomes machine","physical environment","policy intervention","predictive models","predictor variables","present approach","significant discrepancies","six common","social environment","socioeconomic variables","strongest predictors","tract level","urban health","useful complementary","yield fairly","learning algorithms","learning approach","promoting urban","service requests"]},{"DocId":492,"Year":2021,"Title":"Investigating sense of place of the Las Vegas Strip using online reviews and machine learning approaches","Abstract":"Public space is essential to urban public life, activities, and events, and has become a key component of design and regeneration schemes. However, visitors\u2019 experience of public space and the subsequent perceptions and sense of place are often difficult to measure because of its intangible nature and the expensive data collection process. This study collected 20,476 online reviews from 18,387 Tripadvisor users from 2008 to 2019 to understand how visitors experience and react to the public spaces on the Las Vegas Strip. We effectively elicited sense of place on the Las Vegas Strip and quantified the popularity and sentiment of each sense of place facet with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and logistic regression machine learning methods. The results specified 30 distinct topics related to the Strip, among which the most important ones were exploring different hotels, night scene, people watching, and walking long distances. The visitor experience explored within this study uncovered multiple facets of sense of place on the Strip and suggested urban design strategies and public space management policies related to the programmatic and physical elements of the Strip sidewalks. The study shows how online reviews can provide strong empirical evidence for visitor experience in built environment projects.

We used a machine learning-based workflow to predict high resolution (30 m) and sub-daily atmospheric variables fields of near-surface air temperature and humidity, and wind speed. The method used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition applied on ground stations observations or Global Climate Model (GCM) residual error, in a sequence with bias correction and statistical models (Linear Regression-LR, Artificial Neural Network model-ANN and Empirical Quantile Mapping-EQM) to provide downscaling from large scale atmospheric conditions to complex terrain variability. The predictions described relationships of Principal Component (PC) scores dependent on GCM temporal variability on 6-hourly basis (with LR or ANN or EQM), and PC loadings dependent on topographic indexes to help providing horizontal sub-grid extrapolation. The methods were validated with a 1-year dataset from a dense weather stations network deployed in a complex terrain basin in tropical climate of Southeast Brazil. We present an exhaustive description of the PC modes daily\/seasonal variability for each variable, and their spatial variability associated to the topography and thermal driven circulations. The predictions in general substantially improved accuracy when compared to GCM outputs, especially near the valley and in sheltered area where local effects are mandatories. Specially, ANN and EQM significantly improved the predictions at the variability of extreme events, such as the formation of strong cold air pooling or wetting in the valley. \u00a9 2020 Royal

Many downstream applications require comprehensive analysis like geographic information retrieval, recommender systems, geographic knowledge graphs, and in general, understanding urban spaces [28]. Points of Interests (POI), as one of the most researched aspects of urban data, has been successfully modeled using concepts borrowed from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the work of Place2Vec [28], a Word2Vec-like statistical model is proposed to represent spatial adjacency with a continuous embedding space. This method successfully models the functional semantics of POIs with regard to several human-assessment based evaluations. However, though the Place2Vec model addresses the distributional heterogeneity within a given spatial context with ITDL augmentation, it does not address the spatial heterogeneity among different regions. To solve this problem, we propose to introduce a hierarchical, density-based, self-adjusting clustering mechanism. The boundary of relatedness and unrelatedness is learned from the given context, where denser areas have tighter bounds while sparser areas have looser ones. We train our model on both the baseline Yelp hierarchical dataset [28] and our OpenStreetMap dataset. We demonstrate that 1) our model significantly improves the performance on 2 of the 3 baseline tasks and the stability of training, and 2) our model generalizes excellently across 112 cities of radically different scales (minimum 1725 POIs, maximum 2694070 POIs), regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa) and types (commercial, touristy, industrial, etc.) without the need of adjusting or tuning any hyperparameters. We also demonstrate that our model can be used to discover interesting facts about cities like inter-city semantic analogy and intra-city connectivity, which can be very useful in urban planning,

This paper takes Guangzhou city as the study area, illustrates the gridded population distribution map by using machine learning methods based on zoning strategy with multisource geospatial data such as night light remote sensing data, point of interest data, land use data, and so on. The street-level accuracy evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieved good overall accuracy, with determinant coefficient (R2) being 0.713 and root mean square error (RMSE) being 5512.9. Meanwhile, the goodness of fit for single linear regression (LR) model and random forest (RF) regression model are 0.0039 and 0.605, respectively. For dense area, the accuracy of the random forest model is better than the linear regression model, while for sparse area, the accuracy of the linear regression model is better than the random forest model. The results indicated that the proposed method has great potential in fine-scale population mapping. Therefore, it is advised that the zonal modeling strategy should be the primary choice for solving regional differences in the population distribution mapping research. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

This paper addresses how to regulate the heterogeneous traffic flow by a light control mechanism without changing the urban road network.

The integration with the 3D geometry makes this prediction model not only useful to the scientific research, but also as an urban planning tool for environmentally sustainable design. For model development, meteorological data and urban morphology features were used to predict the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily daytime average temperature and daily night-time average temperature. Voting regression (VOT) based on ordinary least square and random forests was used as the regression model. The average CV-R2 and the CV-RMSE predicted by VOT for the outdoor air temperature were 0.84 and 0.52\u00b0C. Compared with ordinary least squares, VOT improved R2 by an average of 18% and RMSE by an average of 24%. Sensitivity analysis indicated the daytime temperature was inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of urban canyon streets. In tropical climates, greenery can be used as a cooling measure. A negative logarithmic relationship was found between the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and green plot ratio. This shows that as the green coverage increases, the cooling effect of greenery increases, and it is more effective to adopt greenery early in areas with less vegetation. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["temperature daily","average temperature","citygml files","daily minimum","lod files","maximum temperature","minimum temperature","urban morphology","daily maximum","adopt greenery","analysis indicated","aspect ratio","canyon streets","climates greenery","combining citygml","convert lod","cooling measure","coverage increases","customized machine","daily average","daily daytime","daytime average","daytime temperature","developed microclimate","developed solution","development meteorological","geometric inputs","geometry makes","green coverage","green plot","greenery early","greenery increases","inversely proportional","lod citygml","logarithmic relationship","measure negative","microclimate simulation","microclimate simulations","model development","morphology features","negative logarithmic","outdoor air","outdoor temperature","planning tool","plot ratio","program based","regression vot","scientific research","sensitivity analysis","simulation program","squares vot","sustainable design","temperature voting","tropical city","tropical climates","urban canyon","using lod","vot based","vot improved","voting regression","better understand","environmentally sustainable","meteorological data","random forests","study developed","cooling effect","learning algorithm","prediction model","regression model","air temperature","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["temperature daily","average temperature","citygml files","daily minimum","lod files","maximum temperature","minimum temperature","urban morphology","daily maximum","adopt greenery","analysis indicated","aspect ratio","better understand","canyon streets","climates greenery","combining citygml","convert lod","cooling measure","coverage increases","customized machine","daily average","daily daytime","daytime average","daytime temperature","developed microclimate","developed solution","development meteorological","environmentally sustainable","geometric inputs","geometry makes","green coverage","green plot","greenery early","greenery increases","inversely proportional","learning algorithm","lod citygml","logarithmic relationship","measure negative","meteorological data","microclimate simulation","microclimate simulations","model development","morphology features","negative logarithmic","outdoor air","outdoor temperature","planning tool","plot ratio","program based","regression vot","scientific research","sensitivity analysis","simulation program","squares vot","study developed","sustainable design","temperature voting","tropical city","tropical climates","urban canyon","using lod","vot based","vot improved","voting regression","prediction model","random forests","regression model","cooling effect","air temperature","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["temperature daily","average temperature","citygml files","daily minimum","lod files","maximum temperature","minimum temperature","urban morphology","daily maximum","adopt greenery","analysis indicated","aspect ratio","better understand","canyon streets","climates greenery","combining citygml","convert lod","cooling measure","coverage increases","customized machine","daily average","daily daytime","daytime average","daytime temperature","developed microclimate","developed solution","development meteorological","environmentally sustainable","geometric inputs","geometry makes","green coverage","green plot","greenery early","greenery increases","inversely proportional","learning algorithm","lod citygml","logarithmic relationship","measure negative","meteorological data","microclimate simulation","microclimate simulations","model development","morphology features","negative logarithmic","outdoor air","outdoor temperature","planning tool","plot ratio","program based","regression vot","scientific research","sensitivity analysis","simulation program","squares vot","study developed","sustainable design","temperature voting","tropical city","tropical climates","urban canyon","using lod","vot based","vot improved","voting regression","prediction model","random forests","regression model","cooling effect","air temperature","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":500,"Year":2020,"Title":"Evaluation of Smart Infrastructure Systems and Novel UV-Oriented Solution for Integration, Resilience, Inclusiveness, and Sustainability","Abstract":"Rapid urbanization nowadays demands the stable functioning of a city's infrastructure, but the traditional infrastructure system faces numerous challenges: unpreparedness for extreme situations, aging and deterioration of existing facilities, costly maintenance, and lack of coordination. Moreover, the transformation from traditional infrastructure into smart infrastructure introduces new challenges both from the underdevelopment of information network and the limitation of AI technologies. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the infrastructure system and the current status of the smart infrastructure system based on the framework of closed feedback control loops: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart infrastructure system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart infrastructure system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart response for city emergency, smart environmental protection, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart infrastructure system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community.

Within urban spaces, these areas have also an important role in preventing illegal occupation in areas of hydrologic risk, such as in floodplains. The goal of this research is to propose a framework for identifying areas of permanent protection associated with perennial drainage, utilizing satellite imagery and digital elevation models (DEM) in association with machine learning techniques. The specific objectives include the development of a decision tree to retrieve perennial drainage over high resolution, 1-meter DEM's, and the development of digital image processing workflow to retrieve surface water bodies from Sentinel-2 imagery. In-situ information on perennial and ephemeral conditions of streams and rivers were obtained to validate our results, that happened in the first trimester of 2020. We propose a minimum of 7 days without precipitation prior to in-situ validation, for more accurate assessment of streamflow conditions, in order to minimize impacts of surface water runoff in flow regime.

Among many machine learning based methods that have worked out successfully in remote sensing scene classification, spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding (ScSPM) is a classical model that has achieved promising classification accuracy on many benchmark data sets. ScSPM is a three-stage algorithm, composed of dictionary learning, sparse representation and classification. It is generally believed that in the dictionary learning stage, although unsupervised, one should use the same data set as classification stage to get good results. However, recent studies in transfer learning suggest that it might be a better strategy to train the dictionary on a larger data set different from the one to classify. In our work, we propose an algorithm that combines ScSPM with self-taught learning, a transfer learning framework that trains a dictionary on an unlabeled data set and uses it for multiple classification tasks. In the experiments, we learn the dictionary on Caltech-101 data set, and classify two remote sensing scene image data sets: UC Merced LandUse data set and Changping data set. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of proposed method is compatible to that of ScSPM. Our work thus provides a new way to reduce resource cost in learning a remote sensing scene image classifier. \u00a9 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data set","sensing scene","dictionary learning","observation images","scene image","pyramid matching","data sets","spatial pyramid","transfer learning","earth observation","learning framework","scene classification","remote sensing","classification accuracy","achieved promising","agriculture environment","algorithm composed","areas like","based methods","benchmark data","better strategy","changping data","classical model","classification remote","classification spatial","classification stage","classify two","coding scspm","combines scspm","framework using","generally believed","get good","image classifier","industrial world","landuse data","larger data","learning remote","learning sparse","learning stage","learning suggest","learning transfer","matching using","merced landuse","multiple classification","novel learning","promising classification","provides new","recent studies","reduce resource","resolution earth","resource cost","sensing earth","set different","set experimental","sets scspm","sets uc","sparse coding","sparse representation","trains dictionary","two remote","uc merced","unlabeled data","using sparse","world benefits","years interpreting","classification tasks","good results","image data","new way","planning agriculture","using spatial","learning based","like urban","environment monitoring","recent years","wide range","high resolution","experimental results","results show","proposed method","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data set","sensing scene","dictionary learning","observation images","scene image","pyramid matching","data sets","spatial pyramid","transfer learning","scene classification","earth observation","learning framework","remote sensing","classification accuracy","achieved promising","agriculture environment","algorithm composed","areas like","based methods","benchmark data","better strategy","changping data","classical model","classification remote","classification spatial","classification stage","classify two","coding scspm","combines scspm","framework using","generally believed","get good","image classifier","industrial world","landuse data","larger data","learning remote","learning sparse","learning stage","learning suggest","learning transfer","matching using","merced landuse","multiple classification","novel learning","promising classification","provides new","recent studies","reduce resource","resolution earth","resource cost","sensing earth","set different","set experimental","sets scspm","sets uc","sparse coding","sparse representation","trains dictionary","two remote","uc merced","unlabeled data","using sparse","world benefits","years interpreting","classification tasks","good results","image data","new way","planning agriculture","using spatial","learning based","like urban","environment monitoring","recent years","wide range","high resolution","experimental results","results show","proposed method","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["data set","sensing scene","dictionary learning","observation images","pyramid matching","scene image","spatial pyramid","data sets","scene classification","transfer learning","classification accuracy","earth observation","learning framework","remote sensing","achieved promising","agriculture environment","algorithm composed","areas like","based methods","benchmark data","better strategy","changping data","classical model","classification remote","classification spatial","classification stage","classify two","coding scspm","combines scspm","framework using","generally believed","get good","image classifier","industrial world","landuse data","larger data","learning remote","learning sparse","learning stage","learning suggest","learning transfer","matching using","merced landuse","multiple classification","new way","novel learning","promising classification","provides new","recent studies","reduce resource","resolution earth","resource cost","sensing earth","set different","set experimental","sets scspm","sets uc","sparse coding","sparse representation","trains dictionary","two remote","uc merced","unlabeled data","using sparse","using spatial","world benefits","years interpreting","classification tasks","good results","high resolution","image data","like urban","planning agriculture","environment monitoring","learning based","recent years","wide range","proposed method","results show","experimental results","machine learning","urban planning"]},{"DocId":505,"Year":2020,"Title":"Object detection of aerial image using mask-region convolutional neural network (mask R-CNN)","Abstract":"The most fundamental task in remote sensing data processing and analysis is object detection.

The information in these images can help to improve activities like urban planning and growth analysis of cities. Additionally, information extracted from these images can be used for taking decisions related to infrastructure planning, e.g. identifying objects that might interfere with network assets like underground cables. To be able to justify the cost of network planning decisions a high degree of interpretability is required. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the state of the art for segmenting these images, but like any black box model they do not offer any explanation for their output. In this paper, we present an approach on how to use a Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) for performing explainable semantic segmentation of trees in satellite images. The FLS uses the HSV (hue, saturation, value) of the pixels as inputs and was optimized by using an evolutionary algorithm called Big Bang Big Crunch. The best configuration for the Interval Type-2 FLS has an Intersection over Union metric measure of 60.6%, which is close to the results obtained from neural network, however the proposed FLS provides interpretable outputs which is highly needed for the real-world operation especially in the telecommunication domain. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["big crunch","explainable semantic","fuzzy logic","logic system","satellite images","semantic segmentation","activities like","additionally information","algorithm called","assets like","bang big","best configuration","big bang","black box","box model","called big","cities additionally","color space","crunch fuzzy","decisions high","decisions related","evolutionary algorithm","fls provides","fls uses","growth analysis","high degree","highly needed","hsv color","hsv hue","hue saturation","identifying objects","images using","improve activities","information extracted","infrastructure planning","interpretable outputs","interval fls","like underground","metric measure","network assets","network planning","new sensor","operation especially","performing explainable","planning decisions","planning identifying","proposed fls","provides interpretable","required convolutional","results obtained","saturation value","system fls","taking decisions","telecommunication domain","underground cables","union metric","use fuzzy","using hsv","years new","networks cnns","sensor technologies","like urban","recent years","neural networks","convolutional neural","neural network","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["big crunch","explainable semantic","fuzzy logic","logic system","satellite images","semantic segmentation","activities like","additionally information","algorithm called","assets like","bang big","best configuration","big bang","black box","box model","called big","cities additionally","color space","crunch fuzzy","decisions high","decisions related","evolutionary algorithm","fls provides","fls uses","growth analysis","high degree","highly needed","hsv color","hsv hue","hue saturation","identifying objects","images using","improve activities","information extracted","infrastructure planning","interpretable outputs","interval fls","like underground","metric measure","network assets","network planning","new sensor","operation especially","performing explainable","planning decisions","planning identifying","proposed fls","provides interpretable","required convolutional","results obtained","saturation value","sensor technologies","system fls","taking decisions","telecommunication domain","underground cables","union metric","use fuzzy","using hsv","years new","networks cnns","like urban","recent years","neural networks","convolutional neural","neural network","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["satellite images","big crunch","explainable semantic","fuzzy logic","logic system","semantic segmentation","activities like","additionally information","algorithm called","assets like","bang big","best configuration","big bang","black box","box model","called big","cities additionally","color space","crunch fuzzy","decisions high","decisions related","evolutionary algorithm","fls provides","fls uses","growth analysis","high degree","highly needed","hsv color","hsv hue","hue saturation","identifying objects","images using","improve activities","information extracted","infrastructure planning","interpretable outputs","interval fls","like underground","metric measure","network assets","network planning","networks cnns","new sensor","operation especially","performing explainable","planning decisions","planning identifying","proposed fls","provides interpretable","required convolutional","results obtained","saturation value","sensor technologies","system fls","taking decisions","telecommunication domain","underground cables","union metric","use fuzzy","using hsv","years new","like urban","recent years","neural networks","neural network","convolutional neural","urban planning"]},{"DocId":507,"Year":2020,"Title":"A deep learning approach to urban street functionality prediction based on centrality measures and stacked denoising autoencoder","Abstract":"In urban planning and transportation management, the centrality characteristics of urban streets are vital measures to consider. Centrality can help in understanding the structural properties of dense traffic networks that affect both human life and activity in cities. Many cities classify urban streets to provide stakeholders with a group of street guidelines for possible new rehabilitation such as sidewalks, curbs, and setbacks. Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments. In our work, a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) predicts a street's functionality, then logistic regression is used as a classifier. Our proposed classifier can differentiate between four different classes adopted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT): principal arterial road, minor arterial road, collector road, and local road. The SDAE-based model showed that regular grid configurations with repeated patterns are more influential in forming the functionality of road networks compared to those with less regularity in their spatial structure. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

innovative mobility technologies will have complex and difficult-to-predict effects on urban transportation systems. Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design. This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO's utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices.

The primary focus of this research is to leverage the abundance of trajectory data to automatically and accurately learn latent semantic relationships between different geographical areas (e.g., semantically correlated neighborhoods of a city) as revealed by patterns of moving objects over time. While previous studies have utilized trajectories for this type of analysis at the level of a single geographical area, the results cannot be easily generalized to inform comparative analysis of different geographical areas. In this paper, we study this problem systematically. First, we present a method that utilizes trajectories to learn low-dimensional representations of geographical areas in an embedded space. Then, we develop a statistical method that allows to quantify the degree to which real trajectories deviate from a theoretical null model. The method allows to (a) distinguish geographical proximity to semantic proximity, and (b) inform a comparative analysis of two (or more) models obtained by trajectories defined on different geographical areas. This deep analysis can improve our understanding of how space is perceived by individuals and inform better decisions of urban planning. Our experimental evaluation aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed statistical method in two large-scale real-world data sets coming from the New York City and the city of Porto, Portugal, respectively. The methods we present are generic and can be utilized to inform a number of useful applications, ranging from location-based services, such as point-of-interest recommendations, to finding semantic relationships between different cities. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["geographical areas","different geographical","semantic relationships","inform comparative","statistical method","trajectory data","useful applications","comparative analysis","accurately learn","applications including","applications ranging","areas based","areas semantically","better decisions","correlated neighborhoods","crowd behavior","deep analysis","develop statistical","distinguish geographical","easily generalized","embedded space","evaluation aims","experimental evaluation","find interesting","finding semantic","geographical area","geographical proximity","including analysis","increasing research","inform better","inform number","interest due","interesting patterns","latent semantic","learn latent","learn representations","learning semantic","method allows","mining trajectory","models obtained","moving objects","null model","porto portugal","portugal respectively","present method","primary focus","problem systematically","proposed statistical","real trajectories","research interest","semantic proximity","semantically correlated","sets coming","single geographical","systems social","theoretical null","trajectories defined","trajectories deviate","trajectories mining","transportation systems","two data","utilized trajectories","utilizes trajectories","broad range","different cities","previous studies","data sets","social networks","york city","new york","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["geographical areas","different geographical","semantic relationships","comparative analysis","inform comparative","statistical method","trajectory data","useful applications","accurately learn","applications including","applications ranging","areas based","areas semantically","better decisions","broad range","correlated neighborhoods","crowd behavior","data sets","deep analysis","develop statistical","different cities","distinguish geographical","easily generalized","embedded space","evaluation aims","experimental evaluation","find interesting","finding semantic","geographical area","geographical proximity","including analysis","increasing research","inform better","inform number","interest due","interesting patterns","latent semantic","learn latent","learn representations","learning semantic","method allows","mining trajectory","models obtained","moving objects","null model","porto portugal","portugal respectively","present method","primary focus","problem systematically","proposed statistical","real trajectories","research interest","semantic proximity","semantically correlated","sets coming","single geographical","systems social","theoretical null","trajectories defined","trajectories deviate","trajectories mining","transportation systems","two data","utilized trajectories","utilizes trajectories","new york","previous studies","social networks","york city","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["geographical areas","different geographical","semantic relationships","comparative analysis","inform comparative","statistical method","useful applications","trajectory data","accurately learn","applications including","applications ranging","areas based","areas semantically","better decisions","broad range","correlated neighborhoods","crowd behavior","data sets","deep analysis","develop statistical","different cities","distinguish geographical","easily generalized","embedded space","evaluation aims","experimental evaluation","find interesting","finding semantic","geographical area","geographical proximity","including analysis","increasing research","inform better","inform number","interest due","interesting patterns","latent semantic","learn latent","learn representations","learning semantic","method allows","mining trajectory","models obtained","moving objects","null model","porto portugal","portugal respectively","present method","previous studies","primary focus","problem systematically","proposed statistical","real trajectories","research interest","semantic proximity","semantically correlated","sets coming","single geographical","systems social","theoretical null","trajectories defined","trajectories deviate","trajectories mining","transportation systems","two data","utilized trajectories","utilizes trajectories","new york","social networks","york city","urban planning"]},{"DocId":512,"Year":2020,"Title":"Region2vec: An Approach for Urban Land Use Detection by Fusing multiple Features","Abstract":"With the advancement of urbanization, urban land use detection has become a research hotspot. Numerous methods have been proposed to identify urban land use, in which points of interest (POI) data is widely used, and sometimes other data source like GPS trajectories is incorporated. However, previous works have hardly fully utilized the global spatial information contained in the POI data, or ignored correlations between features when integrating multiple data source, so resulting in information loss. In this study, we propose an integrated framework titled Region2vec to detect urban land use type by combining POI and mobile phone data. First, POI-based region embeddings are generated by applying Glove model and LDA model to mine the global spatial information and land use topic distributions respectively. The mobile phone data is utilized to generate human activity pattern-based embeddings. Then a similarity matrix is constructed according to POI-based and activity pattern-based embeddings.

The method is automatic, which relieves the work load from statistical surveys and other inefficient traditional approaches. Moreover, while the surveys can only reflect the current conditions, the machine learning approach has the ability of predicting the possible outcomes based on existing data, which is helpful when decisions on protection and development are to be made. We collect data from selected historical sites in Shanghai to illustrate the procedure of the proposed data-driven approach.

Managing the urban economy needs to consider environmental restrictions, environmental monitoring tasks, engineering facilities, and transport. Operational control over the urban environment and the surrounding area can be produced using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the collected data can be processed using a wide range of software and hardware technologies related to the field of artificial intelligence. However, along with any fairly new technology, intelligent unmanned technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. Strengths are mobility and efficiency, relative cheapness, the possibility of a high degree of automation, whereas weaknesses are short flight time, dependence on weather conditions, the certain outstanding tasks of data management and processing. This paper considers the possibilities of using intelligent unmanned technologies based on UAVs for solving the problems of monitoring the urban environment of the Kazakhstan megalopolises. Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles. Furthermore, technological and economic issues, as well as necessary data processing technologies, are discussed.

Different ways of landscape design can add natural landscape to the urban ecosystem, and will not destroy the ecological environment, but will gradually improve the quality of the ecological environment. However, the design methods of landscape in urban planning in China are not perfect enough, there are many problems, and it is difficult to improve the ecological environment of the city. Therefore, in the process of urban planning, the relevant personnel should fully understand the design methods of landscape, and constantly innovate to create a quality living environment for people.

This research has benefited urban planning, logistics, animal migration understanding, and much more. Typically, the movement is captured as precise geographic coordinates and time stamps with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Although some research uses computational techniques to take advantage of implicit movement in descriptions of route directions, hiking paths, and historical exploration routes, innovation would accelerate with a large and diverse corpus. We created a corpus of sentences labeled as describing geographic movement or not and including the type of entity moving. Creating this corpus proved difficult without any comparable corpora to start with, high human labeling costs, and since movement can at times be interpreted differently. To overcome these challenges, we developed an iterative process employing hand labeling, crowd voting for confirmation, and machine learning to predict more labels. By merging advances in word embeddings with traditional machine learning models and model ensembling, prediction accuracy is at an acceptable level to produce a large silver-standard corpus despite the small gold-standard corpus training set.

With such an increasing population and new urban developments, sustainable urban planning procedures play an essential role in Dubai's environmental quality such as air quality, and pollution. Therefore, this study will utilize the Remote Sensing and Geographic Information system (GIS) to investigate Dubai's environmental quality by addressing and locating green areas and pollution percentages within each district. The study methodology is divided into three steps. First, Landsat Satellite medium spatial resolution and multi-spectral imagery will be used as an input for segmentation and object-based analysis. Considering the spectral and spatial signatures for green areas machine learning techniques will be adopted to select the most significant features to classify and extract green areas. Second, using environmental relational indices, green areas percentages will be quantitatively compared to Sentinel air quality data, such as NO2 and SO2, as well as the population density maps. Finally, GIS techniques will be used to create Dubai Environmental Critical Map (DECM), to locate districts with limited green areas and high pollution to improve environmental standards.

In urban planning and design, land use is often determined by experience and case studies. However, the development of urbanization has led to a combinatory trend for land use, and the land use of a plot is always impacted by the surrounding environment. In such a complex situation, it is difficult to find hidden relationships among types of land use by humans alone. Within artificial intelligence, machine learning can help find correlations among data. This paper presents a new method for learning the rules relating the known land use data and predicting the land use of a target plot by constructing an artificial neural network. We take Nanjing as a specific case and study the logic of its land use.

In early model stage, AI methods were used primarily for prediction and forecasting, utilizing quantitative data. With SCADA and sensor applications with internet of things (IOT), AI technologies have increasingly been used for the incorporation of qualitative and subjective information into real time monitoring. With rapid calculation of model results and decision support systems (the AI process), the drainage system can control hydrological devices such as pumps, valves, or gates to adjust or control the flow rate of a drainage system as well as urban drainage ability to model complex hydrological systems in an integrated fashion. There are three parts to the AI applications on blockchain water platform (BWP). From the upstream of BWP, sensors and meters will be able to collect hydrological data such as rain gauge, flowrate, pressure in pipes, and key indicators of water quality. This information will input into hydrological and hydraulic modelling, many engineering modelling software have been used for predicting flow with the scenario analysis. The engineer will be able to run the model 24\/7 to collect data from the studying watershed. With continuous updated results, they will be able to obtain real time monitoring. Finally, through the results from the modelling system, operation procedure, drainage analysis, and the decision support system (DSS), control devices such as pumps, valves, and gates will have the ability to be controlled wirelessly. The AI process will allow the urban stormwater drainage to optimize their operation and produce the most efficient results for urban drainage. With this approach, AI will link the sensor data by internet of things (IOT) into the model with model analysis. The overall benefits of using AI storm water management include an increase of energy efficiency, a decrease in flood risks, and a decrease in cost.

approaches using a visual interface","Abstract":"Air quality is one of the most important topics in our urban life, as it is of great significance for human health and urban planning. However, accurate assessment and prediction of air quality in urban areas are difficult. In major cities, typically only a limited number of air quality monitoring stations are available, and inferring air quality in the un-sampled areas throughout the city is challenging. On the other hand, air quality varies in the urban areas non-linearly; it is highly spatially dependent and considerably influenced by multiple factors, such as building distribution, traffic situation and land uses. In this research, we model air quality in the city of Augsburg using spatial features and high quality sensor data. We identify spatial features such as types and areas of different land uses, road networks with high resolution. We integrate open available data to the air quality prediction. In this regard, we compare a simple baseline model with linear regression models (Ordinary Least-Squares and Ridge Regression) and tree-based machine-learning models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest). In our evaluation, given the non-linearity of the data, tree-based models outperform all linear models, which are commonly used in literatures. In addition, we created an interactive and visual dashboard. This dashboard demonstrates the analytical workflow, gives insight into model performance and uncertainty and visualizes the results. \u00a9 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air quality","spatial features","high resolution","land uses","urban areas","accurate assessment","analytical workflow","approaches using","augsburg using","available data","baseline model","building distribution","characterizing air","cities typically","compare simple","considerably influenced","dashboard demonstrates","data comparison","data models","different approaches","different land","distribution traffic","evaluation given","gives insight","great significance","hand air","highly spatially","identify spatial","important topics","inferring air","integrate open","interface air","limited number","linear models","major cities","mobile measurement","model air","models gradient","models ordinary","models outperform","monitoring stations","multiple factors","open available","open spatial","quality sensor","quality varies","resolution open","road networks","simple baseline","spatial data","spatially dependent","traffic situation","urban life","uses road","using spatial","using visual","visual dashboard","visual interface","workflow gives","high quality","human health","model performance","quality monitoring","quality prediction","ridge regression","sensor data","regression models","gradient boosting","linear regression","random forest","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air quality","high resolution","spatial features","urban areas","land uses","accurate assessment","analytical workflow","approaches using","augsburg using","available data","baseline model","building distribution","characterizing air","cities typically","compare simple","considerably influenced","dashboard demonstrates","data comparison","data models","different approaches","different land","distribution traffic","evaluation given","gives insight","great significance","hand air","highly spatially","human health","identify spatial","important topics","inferring air","integrate open","interface air","limited number","linear models","major cities","mobile measurement","model air","model performance","models gradient","models ordinary","models outperform","monitoring stations","multiple factors","open available","open spatial","quality sensor","quality varies","resolution open","ridge regression","road networks","simple baseline","spatial data","spatially dependent","traffic situation","urban life","uses road","using spatial","using visual","visual dashboard","visual interface","workflow gives","high quality","quality monitoring","quality prediction","regression models","sensor data","random forest","gradient boosting","linear regression","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["air quality","high resolution","spatial features","urban areas","land uses","accurate assessment","analytical workflow","approaches using","augsburg using","available data","baseline model","building distribution","characterizing air","cities typically","compare simple","considerably influenced","dashboard demonstrates","data comparison","data models","different approaches","different land","distribution traffic","evaluation given","gives insight","great significance","hand air","high quality","highly spatially","human health","identify spatial","important topics","inferring air","integrate open","interface air","limited number","linear models","major cities","mobile measurement","model air","model performance","models gradient","models ordinary","models outperform","monitoring stations","multiple factors","open available","open spatial","quality sensor","quality varies","regression models","resolution open","ridge regression","road networks","simple baseline","spatial data","spatially dependent","traffic situation","urban life","uses road","using spatial","using visual","visual dashboard","visual interface","workflow gives","quality monitoring","quality prediction","random forest","sensor data","gradient boosting","linear regression","urban planning"]},{"DocId":527,"Year":2020,"Title":"Mining and Analysis of Air Quality Data to Aid Climate Change","Abstract":"The data science and AI community has gathered around the world to support tackling the climate change problem in different domains.

This article proposes a machine learning, hierarchical object-based method to map slum settlements using very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and land boundary data to support slum upgrading. The proposed method is tested in Kingston Metropolitan Area, Jamaica. First, the VHR imagery is classified into major land cover classes (i.e., the initial land cover map). Second, the VHR imagery and land boundary layer are used to obtain homogenous neighborhoods (HNs). Third, the initial land cover map is used to derive multiple context, spectral, and texture image features according to the local physical characteristics of slum settlements. Fourth, a machine-learning classifier, classification and regression trees, is used to classify HNs into slum and nonslum settlements using only the effective image features. Finally, reference data collected manually are used to assess the accuracy of the classification. In the training site, an overall accuracy of 0.935 is achieved. The effective image indicators for slum mapping include the building layout, building density, building roof characteristics, and distance from buildings to gullies. The classifier and those features selected from the training site are further used to map slums in two validating sites to assess the transferability of our approach. Overall accuracy of the two validating sites reached 0.928 and 0.929, respectively, suggesting that the features and classification model obtained from one site has the potential to be transferred to other areas in Jamaica and possibly other developing Caribbean countries with similar situation and data availability. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land boundary","settlements using","slum settlements","vhr imagery","boundary data","cover map","effective image","initial land","training site","two validating","validating sites","image features","land cover","overall accuracy","accurate mapping","approach overall","area jamaica","article proposes","boundary layer","building density","building layout","caribbean countries","classifier classification","classify hns","collected manually","context spectral","cover classes","data accurate","data availability","data collected","density building","derive multiple","developing caribbean","features according","features finally","features selected","finally reference","fourth classifier","hierarchical method","homogenous neighborhoods","image indicators","kingston metropolitan","layout building","learning hierarchical","local physical","major land","map slum","map slums","mapping include","metropolitan area","model obtained","multiple context","neighborhoods hns","nonslum settlements","obtain homogenous","proposes machine","regression trees","respectively suggesting","roof characteristics","settlements fourth","similar situation","sites reached","slum mapping","slum upgrading","support slum","texture image","urban slum","building roof","classification model","mapping urban","physical characteristics","reference data","proposed method","machine learning","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land boundary","settlements using","slum settlements","vhr imagery","boundary data","cover map","effective image","image features","initial land","training site","two validating","validating sites","land cover","overall accuracy","accurate mapping","approach overall","area jamaica","article proposes","boundary layer","building density","building layout","caribbean countries","classifier classification","classify hns","collected manually","context spectral","cover classes","data accurate","data availability","data collected","density building","derive multiple","developing caribbean","features according","features finally","features selected","finally reference","fourth classifier","hierarchical method","homogenous neighborhoods","image indicators","kingston metropolitan","layout building","learning hierarchical","local physical","major land","map slum","map slums","mapping include","metropolitan area","model obtained","multiple context","neighborhoods hns","nonslum settlements","obtain homogenous","proposes machine","regression trees","respectively suggesting","roof characteristics","settlements fourth","similar situation","sites reached","slum mapping","slum upgrading","support slum","texture image","urban slum","building roof","classification model","mapping urban","physical characteristics","reference data","proposed method","machine learning","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land boundary","settlements using","slum settlements","vhr imagery","land cover","boundary data","cover map","effective image","image features","initial land","training site","two validating","validating sites","overall accuracy","accurate mapping","approach overall","area jamaica","article proposes","boundary layer","building density","building layout","caribbean countries","classifier classification","classify hns","collected manually","context spectral","cover classes","data accurate","data availability","data collected","density building","derive multiple","developing caribbean","features according","features finally","features selected","finally reference","fourth classifier","hierarchical method","homogenous neighborhoods","image indicators","kingston metropolitan","layout building","learning hierarchical","local physical","major land","map slum","map slums","mapping include","mapping urban","metropolitan area","model obtained","multiple context","neighborhoods hns","nonslum settlements","obtain homogenous","physical characteristics","proposes machine","regression trees","respectively suggesting","roof characteristics","settlements fourth","similar situation","sites reached","slum mapping","slum upgrading","support slum","texture image","urban slum","building roof","classification model","reference data","proposed method","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":532,"Year":2020,"Title":"Comparison of performance of artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) in the classification of land cover zones of urban slum region","Abstract":"India is one of the world\u2019s largest economies and economic growth has remained continuous. This has led to accelerating urbanization which requires proper planning and monitoring. As the urban areas are expanding, urban slum areas are also increasing along with it. These growing urban slum areas require proper observation so that existing resources can be employed to provide these regions with the best possible livelihood conditions. For this purpose, urban slum areas as well as surrounding land resources should be well identified and classified so that the existing land resources can be appropriately utilized for future implementation of development activities. Machine learning classification algorithms are found to be very suitable for the identification and classification of remotely sensed images. Their efficiency in feature identification and extraction has established these algorithms as important tools in decision making. In this study, our major objective is to identify and classify different land cover zones in the urban slums areas of Chingrajpara area of Chhattisgarh using remotely-sensed images. For this purpose, high-resolution images, collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are used and these images are classified into different land cover features using two different machine learning algorithms Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF). The results obtained show that the overall accuracy achieved by ANN and RF are 72.6% and 84.35% respectively. The study highlights the role and importance of landcover classification for future planning and management. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban slum","slum areas","cover zones","land resources","artificial neural","different land","network ann","neural network","land cover","forest rf","accelerating urbanization","accuracy achieved","activities machine","aerial vehicles","algorithms artificial","appropriately utilized","areas require","best possible","chhattisgarh using","chingrajpara area","collected using","cover features","development activities","different machine","economic growth","existing land","existing resources","expanding urban","feature identification","features using","future implementation","future planning","growing urban","images collected","important tools","largest economies","livelihood conditions","major objective","obtained show","possible livelihood","proper observation","proper planning","purpose images","purpose urban","region india","remained continuous","require proper","requires proper","slum region","slums areas","study highlights","surrounding land","unmanned aerial","urban slums","using unmanned","vehicles uavs","world largest","classify different","decision making","landcover classification","learning classification","results obtained","sensed images","two different","using images","using two","random forest","classification algorithms","learning algorithms","remotely sensed","machine learning","urban areas","overall accuracy"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban slum","slum areas","artificial neural","cover zones","land resources","network ann","neural network","different land","forest rf","land cover","accelerating urbanization","accuracy achieved","activities machine","aerial vehicles","algorithms artificial","appropriately utilized","areas require","best possible","chhattisgarh using","chingrajpara area","collected using","cover features","decision making","development activities","different machine","economic growth","existing land","existing resources","expanding urban","feature identification","features using","future implementation","future planning","growing urban","images collected","important tools","largest economies","livelihood conditions","major objective","obtained show","possible livelihood","proper observation","proper planning","purpose images","purpose urban","region india","remained continuous","require proper","requires proper","results obtained","sensed images","slum region","slums areas","study highlights","surrounding land","two different","urban slums","using two","using unmanned","vehicles uavs","world largest","random forest","classify different","landcover classification","learning classification","unmanned aerial","using images","classification algorithms","remotely sensed","urban areas","machine learning","learning algorithms","overall accuracy"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urban slum","slum areas","artificial neural","cover zones","land resources","network ann","neural network","different land","land cover","forest rf","accelerating urbanization","accuracy achieved","activities machine","aerial vehicles","algorithms artificial","appropriately utilized","areas require","best possible","chhattisgarh using","chingrajpara area","collected using","cover features","decision making","development activities","different machine","economic growth","existing land","existing resources","expanding urban","feature identification","features using","future implementation","future planning","growing urban","images collected","important tools","landcover classification","largest economies","livelihood conditions","major objective","obtained show","possible livelihood","proper observation","proper planning","purpose images","purpose urban","region india","remained continuous","require proper","requires proper","results obtained","sensed images","slum region","slums areas","study highlights","surrounding land","two different","urban slums","using images","using two","using unmanned","vehicles uavs","world largest","random forest","classify different","learning classification","remotely sensed","unmanned aerial","classification algorithms","urban areas","machine learning","learning algorithms","overall accuracy"]},{"DocId":533,"Year":2020,"Title":"2nd Ibero-American Congress of Smart Cities, ICSC-CITIES 2019","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 22 papers.

maneuver autonomously at low altitude in the urban environments. This is due to the complexity of the urban environment and its unpredictability. Many researches have been carried out in the past decades until recent time, to find a way to solve this problem using powerful sensors such as laser rangefinder sensor, RGB-D camera, stereo vision system, LIDAR and computer vision methods. This paper is aimed to present an urban intelligent navigator for drone using CNN (convolutional neural network). The application of computer vision (object detection) is cheap and has low power consumption compared to other kinds of vision systems. The machine learning allows a drone to detect and recognize all the objects and obstacles on the roads, which can block drone's way. One thousand images were captured of six different street objects (tree, lamp, bump sign, free-smoking sign, no-horn sign, and roof-wall). Those images were used as a dataset to create a machine learning using Faster R-CNN (region convolutional neural network) method. Three machine-learning models were created using different parameters for each model. The controlled parameters are the initial learning rate and the batch-size. Only the third model could successfully detect and recognize all the objects at a specified location showing 98% accuracy. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["drone using","intelligent navigator","sign sign","urban intelligent","convolutional neural","neural network","computer vision","allows drone","block drone","bump sign","camera stereo","cnn convolutional","consumption compared","controlled parameters","create machine","created using","different parameters","different street","drone way","faster region","find way","initial learning","lamp bump","laser rangefinder","learning allows","learning rate","location showing","low altitude","low power","maneuver autonomously","method three","network method","objects tree","past decades","power consumption","powerful sensors","problem using","rangefinder sensor","recent time","region convolutional","sensor camera","showing accuracy","specified location","stereo vision","street objects","successfully detect","system lidar","thousand images","three models","tree lamp","using cnn","using faster","using powerful","vision methods","vision object","vision system","vision systems","learning using","six different","urban environments","challenging task","using different","using convolutional","network cnn","object detection","urban environment","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["drone using","intelligent navigator","sign sign","urban intelligent","convolutional neural","neural network","computer vision","allows drone","block drone","bump sign","camera stereo","cnn convolutional","consumption compared","controlled parameters","create machine","created using","different parameters","different street","drone way","faster region","find way","initial learning","lamp bump","laser rangefinder","learning allows","learning rate","learning using","location showing","low altitude","low power","maneuver autonomously","method three","network method","objects tree","past decades","power consumption","powerful sensors","problem using","rangefinder sensor","recent time","region convolutional","sensor camera","showing accuracy","specified location","stereo vision","street objects","successfully detect","system lidar","thousand images","three models","tree lamp","using cnn","using faster","using powerful","vision methods","vision object","vision system","vision systems","six different","urban environments","challenging task","using convolutional","using different","network cnn","object detection","urban environment","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["drone using","intelligent navigator","sign sign","urban intelligent","convolutional neural","neural network","computer vision","allows drone","block drone","bump sign","camera stereo","cnn convolutional","consumption compared","controlled parameters","create machine","created using","different parameters","different street","drone way","faster region","find way","initial learning","lamp bump","laser rangefinder","learning allows","learning rate","learning using","location showing","low altitude","low power","maneuver autonomously","method three","network method","objects tree","past decades","power consumption","powerful sensors","problem using","rangefinder sensor","recent time","region convolutional","sensor camera","showing accuracy","specified location","stereo vision","street objects","successfully detect","system lidar","thousand images","three models","tree lamp","urban environment","using cnn","using faster","using powerful","vision methods","vision object","vision system","vision systems","machine learning","six different","urban environments","using convolutional","using different","challenging task","network cnn","object detection"]},{"DocId":536,"Year":2019,"Title":"Urban street contexts classification using convolutional neural networks and streets imagery","Abstract":"The classification of streets on road networks has been focused on the vehicular transportational features of streets. Examples of street labels include arterials, major roads, minor roads and so forth based on their transportational use. City authorities on the other hand have been shifting to more wholistic planning of streets. The modern approach towards designing and planning streets is more inclusive of the street context, meaning the side use of a street combined with the transportational features of a street. Several city authorities are developing new classification schemes for street context that extends traditional classification methods to include the use of land on the sides of a street. In those classification schemes, streets are labeled for example as commercial throughway, residential neighborhood, park etc. This modern approach to urban planning have been adopted by major cities such as the city of San Francisco, the state of Florida and Pennsylvania among many others. Currently, the process of labeling streets according to their contexts is manual and hence is tedious and time consuming. It will require manual labor to regularly relabel streets as the city develops. In this paper, we propose an approach to deploy advancements in computer vision towards modern urban planning. We propose a framework for automatic classification of street contexts. Using labeled street imagery we train deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform the classification of street context. We show that CNN models can perform well achieving accuracies in the 81% to 87% range. We test various CNN architectures and report on their performances. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street context","city authorities","classification schemes","modern approach","street contexts","transportational features","neural networks","convolutional neural","achieving accuracies","arterials major","automatic classification","city develops","cnn architectures","cnn models","commercial throughway","context meaning","contexts classification","contexts using","deploy advancements","extends traditional","forth based","include arterials","labeled street","labeling streets","labels include","major cities","major roads","manual labor","minor roads","neighborhood park","new classification","planning streets","propose framework","regularly relabel","relabel streets","require manual","residential neighborhood","roads minor","san francisco","schemes streets","side use","street combined","street imagery","street labels","streets according","streets examples","streets imagery","test various","throughway residential","train deep","transportational use","use city","using labeled","various cnn","vehicular transportational","wholistic planning","developing new","modern urban","networks cnn","road networks","traditional classification","urban street","time consuming","classification methods","using convolutional","classification using","deep convolutional","computer vision","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street context","modern approach","street contexts","transportational features","classification schemes","city authorities","convolutional neural","neural networks","achieving accuracies","arterials major","automatic classification","city develops","classification methods","classification using","cnn architectures","cnn models","commercial throughway","context meaning","contexts classification","contexts using","deploy advancements","developing new","extends traditional","forth based","include arterials","labeled street","labeling streets","labels include","major cities","major roads","manual labor","minor roads","neighborhood park","networks cnn","new classification","planning streets","propose framework","regularly relabel","relabel streets","require manual","residential neighborhood","roads minor","san francisco","schemes streets","side use","street combined","street imagery","street labels","streets according","streets examples","streets imagery","test various","throughway residential","time consuming","traditional classification","train deep","transportational use","use city","using labeled","various cnn","vehicular transportational","wholistic planning","modern urban","road networks","using convolutional","urban street","urban planning","deep convolutional","computer vision"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["street context","classification schemes","convolutional neural","modern approach","neural networks","street contexts","transportational features","city authorities","urban planning","achieving accuracies","arterials major","automatic classification","city develops","classification methods","classification using","cnn architectures","cnn models","commercial throughway","context meaning","contexts classification","contexts using","deep convolutional","deploy advancements","developing new","extends traditional","forth based","include arterials","labeled street","labeling streets","labels include","major cities","major roads","manual labor","minor roads","modern urban","neighborhood park","networks cnn","new classification","planning streets","propose framework","regularly relabel","relabel streets","require manual","residential neighborhood","road networks","roads minor","san francisco","schemes streets","side use","street combined","street imagery","street labels","streets according","streets examples","streets imagery","test various","throughway residential","time consuming","traditional classification","train deep","transportational use","urban street","use city","using convolutional","using labeled","various cnn","vehicular transportational","wholistic planning","computer vision"]},{"DocId":537,"Year":2019,"Title":"Integrating activity-based geographic information and long-term remote sensing to characterize urban land use change","Abstract":"The land use structure is a key component to understand the complexity of urban systems because it provides a snapshot of urban dynamics and how people use space. This paper integrates socially sensed activity data with a remotely sensed land cover product in order to infer urban land use and its changes over time. We conducted a case study in theWashington D.C.-Baltimore metropolitan area to identify the pattern of land use change from undeveloped to developed land, including residential and non-residential uses for a period covering 1986-2008. The proposed approach modeled physical and behavioral features of land parcels from a satellite-based impervious surface cover change product and georeferenced Tweets, respectively. A model assessment with random forests classifiers showed that the proposed classification workflow could classify residential and non-residential land uses at an accuracy of 81%, 4% better than modeling the same land uses from physical features alone. Using the timestamps of the impervious surface cover change product, the study also reconstructed the timeline of the identified land uses. The results indicated that the proposed approach was capable of mapping detailed land use and change in an urban region, and represents a new and viable way forward for urban land use surveying that could be especially useful for surveying and tracking changes in cities where traditional approaches and mapping products (i.e., from remote sensing products) may have a limited capacity to capture change. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","land uses","change product","surface cover","impervious surface","proposed approach","urban land","use change","cover change","activity data","approach modeled","behavioral features","capture change","characterize urban","classification workflow","classifiers showed","conducted case","cover product","developed land","especially useful","forests classifiers","georeferenced tweets","identified land","including residential","infer urban","integrates socially","integrating geographic","key component","land including","land parcels","mapping detailed","mapping products","metropolitan area","model assessment","modeled physical","paper integrates","people use","period covering","physical features","proposed classification","provides snapshot","represents new","respectively model","sensed activity","sensed land","sensing products","socially sensed","thewashington metropolitan","tracking changes","tweets respectively","urban dynamics","urban systems","use space","use structure","use surveying","viable way","way forward","classify residential","detailed land","limited capacity","traditional approaches","remote sensing","random forests","urban region","geographic information","results indicated","case study","remotely sensed","land cover"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","land uses","change product","cover change","impervious surface","surface cover","use change","urban land","proposed approach","remote sensing","activity data","approach modeled","behavioral features","capture change","characterize urban","classification workflow","classifiers showed","classify residential","conducted case","cover product","detailed land","developed land","especially useful","forests classifiers","geographic information","georeferenced tweets","identified land","including residential","infer urban","integrates socially","integrating geographic","key component","land cover","land including","land parcels","limited capacity","mapping detailed","mapping products","metropolitan area","model assessment","modeled physical","paper integrates","people use","period covering","physical features","proposed classification","provides snapshot","represents new","respectively model","sensed activity","sensed land","sensing products","socially sensed","thewashington metropolitan","tracking changes","traditional approaches","tweets respectively","urban dynamics","urban region","urban systems","use space","use structure","use surveying","viable way","way forward","case study","random forests","remotely sensed","results indicated"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["land use","land uses","change product","cover change","impervious surface","surface cover","use change","urban land","proposed approach","remote sensing","activity data","approach modeled","behavioral features","capture change","characterize urban","classification workflow","classifiers showed","classify residential","conducted case","cover product","detailed land","developed land","especially useful","forests classifiers","geographic information","georeferenced tweets","identified land","including residential","infer urban","integrates socially","integrating geographic","key component","land cover","land including","land parcels","limited capacity","mapping detailed","mapping products","metropolitan area","model assessment","modeled physical","paper integrates","people use","period covering","physical features","proposed classification","provides snapshot","represents new","respectively model","sensed activity","sensed land","sensing products","socially sensed","thewashington metropolitan","tracking changes","traditional approaches","tweets respectively","urban dynamics","urban region","urban systems","use space","use structure","use surveying","viable way","way forward","case study","random forests","remotely sensed","results indicated"]},{"DocId":538,"Year":2019,"Title":"THE POTENTIAL of BUILDING DETECTION from SAR and LIDAR USING DEEP LEARNING","Abstract":"The introduction of airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) approach has successfully addressed several challenges for mapping and surveying applications Unlike other conventional sensors, airborne SAR mapping approach offers practicality and significant cost savings for the nation minimizing the need for ground control points on the ground in addition to providing high-resolution, day-and-night, cloud coverage and weather independent images, which in turn provides faster turnaround times for creation of large area geospatial data.

Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services.

IoT refers to the connection of devices that transforms a wide range of fields. In medicine, for instance, connected devices can assist medical professionals in monitoring patients inside and outside of hospitals. Practitioners adjust treatments and improve patient outcomes using the produced data. Another field in which a transformation occurs is urban planning. Sensors with an IP address are placed under a busy street, so drivers can be alerted about upcoming delays or accidents. The explosive growth in the number of devices connected to the IoT and the exponential increase in data consumption only reflect how the growth of large data sets is perfectly overlapping with that of IoT. In addition to increased volume, the IoT-generated large data sets exhibit a mixture of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of these data sets is the key to developing smart IoT applications. Since IoT will be among the greatest sources of new data, data science is used to make IoT applications more intelligent. Analysis of these data sets, in practice, is done using various data science techniques. Data science is the compounding of different disciplines of sciences that uses data mining, machine learning, and other techniques to get forms and fresh insights from data. The different algorithms are applied to the information in order to draw out higher-level information from IoT data sets. These techniques include a wide scope of algorithms applied in different domains and comprise both unsupervised and supervised methods. The procedure of applying data analytic methods to particular areas involves data models such as neural networks, classification, clustering methods, and applying efficient algorithms that fit with the data characteristics. In this article, we focus on statistical analysis of the collected data sets and look at the similarities and differences of data mining and statistical methods for IoT systems. By explaining the need for both descriptive and inferential statistical methods, we show the inadequacy of using only unsupervised data mining techniques for IoT data sets. We then concentrate on statistical inference approaches, such as the design-based and model-based inferences, and discuss the role of explanatory versus forecasting statistical models in an IoT environment. Lastly, we demonstrate the danger of making forecasts using only unsupervised techniques by revealing open challenges as future research directions. \u00a9 2019, Springer International Publishing AG,

space: Machine intuition and non-linear neural aggregations","Abstract":"Spatial networks have long been known for their internal spatial order or beauty (Hillier, 2007) and in the field spatial computation and analytics we employ a number of graph based methodologies in order to understand or extract intrinsic attributes of the urban fabric around us. In this research we take a complete different approach by looking at urban structure through the use of deep convolutional variational autoencoders with interesting results. Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique in which we employ neural networks for the task of representation learning. Specifically, a neural network architecture imposes a bottleneck in the network which forces a compressed and generalization of the knowledge representation of the structure of space. This non-linear compression and subsequent reconstruction creates a unique set of features that are inherent of urban space. Our network is multiple layers deep in order to be able to encode basic spatial complexity and is build based on a convolutional network architecture which is inspired by biological processes similar to the connectivity pattern between neurons that resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Artificial neurons respond to real urban networks of London in a restricted region of the visual field, which partially overlap such that they cover the entire convolutional visual field. Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. Each convolutional neuron processes data only for its receptive field but the cascading nature of our network build a knowledge of more complex spatial relations as data move deeper. While convolutional neural networks are extensively used in supervised image classification the work presented in this papers is completely unsupervised. In this paper we present the complete architecture of the deep convolutional network that was trained for months using data from the city of London, concluding with two significant outcomes extracted from the variational encoding and decoding processes. A non-linear clustering, or neural aggregation, of urban space based on the learned features and a generative urban network output based on the variational synthesis we call machine intuition. \u00a9 2019 Beijing JiaoTong University.

We select Yangon as the study area because the government faces many problems in urban planning sectors due to the population growth and urban sprawl. Therefore, the proposed method aims to perform the land cover classification in Yangon using Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and post-classification change detection between 1987 and 2017 with 5 years interval periods are evaluated. Despite land cover classifications using satellite imagery have been executed in the past decades, the classification of remotely sensed data integrating with multiple spectral, temporal and textural features and processing time for classification using time series data still have limitations. To overcome these limitations, features extracted from Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Landsat-7, Landsat-5 and Open Street Map (OSM) are executed for classification and cloud-based GEE platform is used to reduce the processing time. Some spectral indexes such as NDVI, NDBI and slope from SRTM are calculated to achieve better classification. Land cover classification is performed by using the RF classifier with the different bands' combination. Land cover classification map with 7 classes (Shrub Land, Bare Land, Forest, Vegetation, Urban Area, Lake and River) is obtained with the overall accuracy of 96.73% and kappa statistic of 0.95 for 2017. Finally, change detection analysis over 30 years is performed and the significant changes in build-up, bare land, and agriculture have been resulted. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["cover classification","change detection","land cover","detection analysis","images using","processing time","rf classifier","bare land","using machine","achieve better","analysis based","area lake","bands combination","better classification","classes shrub","classification land","classification map","classification using","classifications using","combination land","data integrating","different bands","features extracted","finally change","forest vegetation","government faces","interval periods","land bare","land forest","learning land","limitations features","map osm","method aims","multiple spectral","multispectral satellite","ndvi ndbi","past decades","planning sectors","sectors due","select yangon","shrub land","spectral indexes","spectral temporal","street map","textural features","using random","using time","vegetation urban","yangon using","years interval","cover classifications","gee platform","kappa statistic","open street","series data","time series","urban sprawl","engine gee","sensed data","significant changes","earth engine","important factors","using satellite","sensing images","environmental management","google earth","population growth","proposed method","learning algorithm","urban area","satellite imagery","remotely sensed","satellite images","urban planning","machine learning","forest rf","study area","overall accuracy","random forest","remote sensing"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["cover classification","change detection","detection analysis","land cover","images using","processing time","using machine","bare land","rf classifier","urban planning","achieve better","analysis based","area lake","bands combination","better classification","classes shrub","classification land","classification map","combination land","data integrating","different bands","finally change","forest vegetation","government faces","important factors","interval periods","kappa statistic","land bare","land forest","learning land","limitations features","map osm","method aims","multiple spectral","multispectral satellite","ndvi ndbi","past decades","planning sectors","population growth","sectors due","select yangon","series data","shrub land","significant changes","spectral indexes","spectral temporal","street map","time series","urban sprawl","using random","using satellite","using time","vegetation urban","yangon using","years interval","classification using","classifications using","cover classifications","environmental management","features extracted","gee platform","open street","satellite imagery","satellite images","sensing images","textural features","earth engine","engine gee","learning algorithm","proposed method","sensed data","study area","urban area","google earth","remotely sensed","forest rf","machine learning","overall accuracy","random forest","remote sensing"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["cover classification","change detection","detection analysis","land cover","images using","processing time","using machine","bare land","rf classifier","urban planning","achieve better","analysis based","area lake","bands combination","better classification","classes shrub","classification land","classification map","combination land","cover classifications","data integrating","different bands","finally change","forest vegetation","government faces","important factors","interval periods","kappa statistic","land bare","land forest","learning algorithm","learning land","limitations features","map osm","method aims","multiple spectral","multispectral satellite","ndvi ndbi","past decades","planning sectors","population growth","proposed method","satellite imagery","satellite images","sectors due","select yangon","sensed data","series data","shrub land","significant changes","spectral indexes","spectral temporal","street map","time series","urban sprawl","using random","using satellite","using time","vegetation urban","yangon using","years interval","classification using","classifications using","earth engine","engine gee","environmental management","features extracted","gee platform","open street","remotely sensed","sensing images","textural features","google earth","study area","urban area","machine learning","forest rf","overall accuracy","random forest","remote sensing"]},{"DocId":549,"Year":2019,"Title":"15th European Conference on Ambient Intelligence, AmI 2019","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 30 papers.

It allows users to find bikes anywhere via a GPS-based mobile application, and flexible cycling and parking the bikes in the same way. From the bike trajectory data produced by Users, we can extract bike flow patterns for better urban planning and Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. In this paper, through conducting the spatio-temporal representations of bike activity acquired from bike trajectory logs, we first design a graph clustering model With sparsity constraints that combine time information to explore potential patterns of bike flow. Next, by comparing historical trajectory logs and POI information with the flow patterns, we dig out several typical categories of bike flow patterns, which can give suggestions for further urban planning and POI recommendation. Further, our experiments via Mobike trajectory data demonstrate the effectiveness of bike flow pattern discovery. \u00a9 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["bike flow","flow patterns","bike trajectory","trajectory data","poi recommendation","trajectory logs","activity acquired","allows users","better urban","bike activity","bikes flourish","clustering model","combine time","comparing historical","data demonstrate","data produced","demand analysis","design graph","dockless bike","dockless shared","explore potential","extract bike","find bikes","flexible cycling","flow pattern","give suggestions","graph clustering","historical trajectory","latent flow","mobike trajectory","mobile application","new concept","patterns discovery","poi information","potential patterns","shared bikes","sparsity constraints","typical categories","urban planning","recent years","time information","pattern discovery"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["bike flow","flow patterns","bike trajectory","trajectory data","poi recommendation","trajectory logs","activity acquired","allows users","better urban","bike activity","bikes flourish","clustering model","combine time","comparing historical","data demonstrate","data produced","demand analysis","design graph","dockless bike","dockless shared","explore potential","extract bike","find bikes","flexible cycling","flow pattern","give suggestions","graph clustering","historical trajectory","latent flow","mobike trajectory","mobile application","new concept","pattern discovery","patterns discovery","poi information","potential patterns","shared bikes","sparsity constraints","time information","typical categories","urban planning","recent years"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["bike flow","flow patterns","bike trajectory","trajectory data","poi recommendation","trajectory logs","activity acquired","allows users","better urban","bike activity","bikes flourish","clustering model","combine time","comparing historical","data demonstrate","data produced","demand analysis","design graph","dockless bike","dockless shared","explore potential","extract bike","find bikes","flexible cycling","flow pattern","give suggestions","graph clustering","historical trajectory","latent flow","mobike trajectory","mobile application","new concept","pattern discovery","patterns discovery","poi information","potential patterns","shared bikes","sparsity constraints","time information","typical categories","recent years","urban planning"]},{"DocId":551,"Year":2019,"Title":"Exploring different combinations of data and methods for urban land use analysis: A survey","Abstract":"Modern planning and management of urban spaces is an essential topic for smart cities and depends on up-to-date and reliable information on land use and functional roles of the places that integrate urban areas. In the last years, driven by increased availability of geo-referenced data from social or embedded sensors and remote sensing (RS) images, various methods become popular for land use analysis. This paper addresses the various methods employed in this context, as well as needed data and respective categorization, best applications of each method, and their comparison. We focus on approaches based on data from RS images, open maps and various categories of crowdsourced data. We identify and discuss the way these approaches use Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML). From our initial study we concluded that even using the same methods and the same kind of data, results depend on spatial configuration of the data, accordingly to the specificity of each region.

This paper shows that different artificial intelligence techniques can be combined to provide the commander with various form of intelligence augmentation and to support the decision making process. A warfare model has been developed where an AI system, representing a red unit, learns how to select the position for a target and for several improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in order to prevent the blue unit to locate the target. The blue unit is trained to reach the target by using deep reinforcement learning, while an evolutionary algorithm is used to train the red unit. These techniques do not rely on large amounts of historical data. Different approaches have been used and discussed to optimise the co-learning of the two agents, showing that optimal behaviour can be learned in an urban environment. Information about the most likely positions of the target and the IEDs can be extracted from the policy learned by the system, and used by the commander to provide intelligence augmentation while planning an operation and evaluating different possible courses of action. The reliability of this information depends on the realism of the AI system simulating the red unit, that is strictly dependent on the model used for the blue unit during the training. \u00a9 COPYRIGHT SPIE.

As a general approach of public emotion, measuring happiness has is an active focus with great marketing potential since actually, it concerned prominently by the government in recent years. Different authors have measured urban emotion in a variety of ways. Prior spatial-oriented urban emotion measurement tools practice on the macroscale level for the nation and mesoscale level for community result in a lack of microscale level for the street. This paper presents a spatial-oriented microscale measurement approach of urban emotion based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, which enables a data collection and visualization from human emotion recognition and object recognition technology.

The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity.

one of the most important applications in downstream space activities. It is widely used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, topographic mapping, agricultural censuses and disaster prevention. However, traditional satellite remote sensing is subject to high cost and long data acquisition cycles, and it is difficult for users to get the data in time. These problems result in insufficient data supply capacity of remote sensing satellites, which leads to difficulties in supporting daily business applications and establishing a fast-growing business model business models. The small satellite segment has seen rapid market growth and technological advancements since 2013 following the multiple successful launches, most notably the Planet, Spire and others. Economies of scale during production are one of the core advantages of the small satellites segment, thus allowing for significant cost reduction throughout their development and production cycles. At the same time, big data analysis and the artificial intelligence (AI) industries are booming. Periodically full coverage data from small satellites provides a data source for data mining and periodic statistics for a wide range of targets. It provides huge opportunities and extension channels for the applications of big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in Earth observation (EO). The present paper describes research on the technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. In the first section of the paper, a literature review of the common downstream space activities along with identifying the limitations of Earth Observation in terms of high cost and long data acquisition cycles is presented. In the second section, the paper outlines a 4G case study to show that how the improvement of infrastructure brings new application scenarios, verticals and consumers. In the third section, the paper considers the possible new market opportunities of the 5G technology in the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. Finally, it concludes by proposing two prototype models in agriculture monitoring and disaster and emergency responses, assesses the technical and commercial increment relative to the current business.

We conduct our research by first adopting a flexible ontological framework to organize the concepts governing placeness. Next, we curate a dataset of community generated Instagram posts from Starbucks in three major metropolitan cities of the world: New York, Seoul, and Tokyo. The curated dataset is then automatically enriched with contextual attributes such as activity, visitor demographics, and time via machine learning techniques. We finally analyze and validate the quantitative variations in contextual information with findings from well-accepted cross-cultural case studies.

Due to the simultaneous involvement of varied factors with an individual's perception of livability, this concept is difficult to measure. Therefore, a more objective means of quantifying livability is needed. The service industry has demonstrated the intersection of machine learning classifiers and survey domain knowledge for evaluating users' quality of experiences; however, this process of inquiry-based learning has never been considered for solving the communication difficulties between community stakeholders and transportation agencies. Another area of overlap is that of urban computing, which integrates computing technology in the traditional context of urban areas, connecting ubiquitous sensing technologies, computational power, and data about the urban environment to promote quality of life for people living in a particular community. To this aim, the focus of this study is on interpreting a linkage between society stated preferences and quantitative measures of livability by extracting information from survey-based methods and translating it to a quantitative framework using combined service industry and urban computing methodologies. This work focuses on four transportation planning-related research questions in this blended framework: understanding existing livability patterns, predicting heterogeneous perceptions of quality of

We hypothesize that most industries develop new entities based on the number of companies from the same industry that already exist in a region. We also hypothesize that entrepreneurs create new entities based on related industries operating within the same knowledge pool. To test these hypotheses, we used the machine learning decision tree method. The input variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland in 2009. The target values are the number of new companies from these industries created in the years 2009-2015. The principal results show that localization decisions are mostly based on demand and supply industries, in which manufacturing industries play crucial role. Path dependency appears in less than half of the industries' models and thus is not the main factor influencing decisions regarding the creation of new companies. The highest share of path-dependent industries is in manufacturing sector, but the degree of the dependence is lower than in the service sector. The service sector seems to be the least path-dependent, as services usually serve other industries. Competition in industries is a rare factor in new company creation; however, if it appears, it usually shrinks the industry. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["localization decisions","path dependency","entities based","market forces","new companies","new entities","service sector","company creation","create new","crucial role","decisions regarding","dependency appears","different industries","entrepreneurs create","factor influencing","highest share","industries competition","industries created","industries develop","industries located","industries models","industries operating","industries play","influencing decisions","input variables","knowledge pool","learning decision","main factor","manufacturing industries","manufacturing sector","new company","play crucial","principal results","rare factor","related industries","role path","sector seems","services usually","supply industries","target values","tree method","usually serve","usually shrinks","develop new","decision tree","results show","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["localization decisions","path dependency","entities based","market forces","new companies","new entities","service sector","company creation","create new","crucial role","decisions regarding","dependency appears","develop new","different industries","entrepreneurs create","factor influencing","highest share","industries competition","industries created","industries develop","industries located","industries models","industries operating","industries play","influencing decisions","input variables","knowledge pool","learning decision","main factor","manufacturing industries","manufacturing sector","new company","play crucial","principal results","rare factor","related industries","results show","role path","sector seems","services usually","supply industries","target values","tree method","usually serve","usually shrinks","decision tree","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["localization decisions","path dependency","entities based","market forces","new companies","new entities","service sector","company creation","create new","crucial role","decision tree","decisions regarding","dependency appears","different industries","entrepreneurs create","factor influencing","highest share","industries competition","industries created","industries develop","industries located","industries models","industries operating","industries play","influencing decisions","input variables","knowledge pool","learning decision","main factor","manufacturing industries","manufacturing sector","new company","play crucial","principal results","rare factor","related industries","results show","role path","sector seems","services usually","supply industries","target values","tree method","usually serve","usually shrinks","develop new","machine learning"]},{"DocId":571,"Year":2017,"Title":"Multi-scale modeling of territorial dynamics of geospatial anthropogenic energy consumption","Abstract":"Objective: The development of any region or territory stems from its own dynamic nature. Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the

neural network to help predict the microclimate of the building. The geographic representation of an urban area in Syracuse generated in GIS was converted to the computational domain used in CFD simulation. The flow field around the building was simulated using the CFD model under different wind speeds and directions. Results from CFD simulation could be well presented in GIS using anchored coordinate system. The flow patterns were very similar when the wind speed was varied, while they were highly dependent on the wind directions. However, predicting the flow fields of different wind directions requires running the CFD simulation for each case. A neural network for machine learning was adopted to help predict the microclimate around the building so that much time can be saved. The results show that the proposed neural network has the potential to help predict the microclimate. The predicted microclimate could be used for further study of the building performance. \u00a9 2017 Building Simulation Conference Proceedings.

They have highly improved in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions and by the sheer volume of collected images, the necessity of simplification of automation in feature extraction. Road data play a key role in urban planning, traffic management, military applications, and vehicle navigation as well as for decision making in numerous applications. The faster updation of road infrastructure is a need because the technology has brought map in the hands of people in the form of mobile phones and tablets. Road detection is one of the major issues of the road infrastructure extraction. Its accuracy depends on the type of methodology used. An attempt is made here to analyse the first order, the co-occurrence texture features and image transforms useful for discriminating roads from other features specially the buildings. The identified dataset forms high dimension feature space and the Support Vector Machine is a theoretically superior machine learning methodology with great results in classification of high dimensional datasets. In the past, SVMs have been tested and evaluated only as pixel-based image classifiers. Moving from pixel-based techniques towards object-based representation, the dimensions of remote sensing imagery feature space increases significantly. An SVM approach for classification was followed, based on primitive image objects produces by a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. The SVM procedure produced the final object classification results which were compared to the Nearest Neighbor classifier results and were found to give better results in OBIA domain. \u00a9 2017 ACRS.

augmented learning model","Abstract":"From a salient point of view, urban planning has a significant impact on the expansion of the residential, industrial and commercial land. Land planning has a positive impact on the development of residential land but negatively affects the expansion of industrial, commercial and mining land, that is to say, the plot planned for construction land has a lower probability of transforming into construction land, which is not in line with common sense, indicating that the compilation of the land planning is far from the expansion of actual construction land. Therefore, this paper presents the urban inefficient industrial land recognition system based on augmented learning model. We adopt endogenous optimization method to determine the weight of each input factor, do not need to estimate parameters in advance, no correlation requirement to input and output variables, avoiding the input-output relationship of the expression and the index weight to determine the specific functional form of subjectivity. With this model, the urban planning model is then optimized to satisfy the general requirements.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["construction land","augmented learning","industrial land","inefficient industrial","land recognition","recognition system","system based","urban inefficient","land planning","learning model","actual construction","adopt endogenous","common sense","correlation requirement","endogenous optimization","estimate parameters","functional form","general requirements","index weight","industrial commercial","input factor","land land","lower probability","mining land","negatively affects","output variables","planning model","plot planned","positive impact","residential industrial","salient point","sense indicating","significant impact","specific functional","variables avoiding","view urban","commercial land","optimization method","residential land","paper presents","urban planning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["construction land","augmented learning","inefficient industrial","land recognition","recognition system","system based","urban inefficient","industrial land","land planning","learning model","actual construction","adopt endogenous","common sense","correlation requirement","endogenous optimization","estimate parameters","functional form","general requirements","index weight","industrial commercial","input factor","land land","lower probability","mining land","negatively affects","output variables","planning model","plot planned","positive impact","residential industrial","salient point","sense indicating","significant impact","specific functional","variables avoiding","view urban","optimization method","commercial land","residential land","paper presents","urban planning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["construction land","augmented learning","industrial land","inefficient industrial","land recognition","recognition system","system based","urban inefficient","land planning","learning model","actual construction","adopt endogenous","commercial land","common sense","correlation requirement","endogenous optimization","estimate parameters","functional form","general requirements","index weight","industrial commercial","input factor","land land","lower probability","mining land","negatively affects","output variables","planning model","plot planned","positive impact","residential industrial","salient point","sense indicating","significant impact","specific functional","variables avoiding","view urban","optimization method","residential land","urban planning","paper presents"]},{"DocId":577,"Year":2017,"Title":"1st Asia-Pacific Web and Web-Age Information Management Joint Conference on Web and Big Data, APWeb-WAIM 2017 held in Conjuction with the International Workshop on Mobile Web Data Analytics, MWDA 2017, International Workshop on Hot Topics in Big Spatial Data and Urban Computing, HotSpatial 2017, International Workshop on Graph Data Management and Analysis, GDMA 2017, 2nd International Workshop on Data Driven Crowdsourcing, DDC 2017, 2nd International Workshop on Spatio-temporal Data Management and Analytics, SDMA 2017 and International Workshop on Mobility Analytics from Spatial and Social Data, MASS 2017","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 25 papers.

stakeholders and members of public, to inform plans and evaluation of proposals. A lot of rich information comes in textual forms, which traditionally have to be read manually. With advancements in machine learning capabilities, there is potential to tap on it to aid planners in synthesizing insights from large amount of textual feedback data more efficiently. In this paper, we developed a more general urban-centric feedback analysis framework, which encompasses the spatio-temporal thematic of ground sensing. Three essential methods: geotagging, topic modeling, and trend analysis are proposed and a prototype has been implemented. The results of experiments indicate that the proposed framework could not only accurately extract precise geospatial information, but also efficiently analyze the semantic themes based on a probabilistic topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Importantly, the spatial and temporal trends of detected topics indicate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and then benefit domain experts in their routine work and reveal many interesting insights on ground sensing matters. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ground sensing","topic modeling","accurately extract","aid planners","allocation importantly","analysis framework","analytics framework","benefit domain","detected topics","domain experts","efficiently analyze","essential methods","experiments indicate","extract precise","feedback analysis","feedback data","general feedback","geospatial information","geotagging topic","getting feedback","inform plans","information comes","interesting insights","involved getting","learning capabilities","methods geotagging","precise geospatial","proposed algorithm","read manually","rich information","routine work","semantic themes","sensing matters","sensing three","sensing urban","sta thematic","synthesizing insights","temporal trends","textual feedback","textual forms","thematic analytics","themes based","three essential","topics indicate","trend analysis","urban ground","various stakeholders","probabilistic topic","large amount","proposed framework","dirichlet allocation","latent dirichlet","urban planning","machine learning"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ground sensing","topic modeling","accurately extract","aid planners","allocation importantly","analysis framework","analytics framework","benefit domain","detected topics","domain experts","efficiently analyze","essential methods","experiments indicate","extract precise","feedback analysis","feedback data","general feedback","geospatial information","geotagging topic","getting feedback","inform plans","information comes","interesting insights","involved getting","large amount","learning capabilities","methods geotagging","precise geospatial","proposed algorithm","read manually","rich information","routine work","semantic themes","sensing matters","sensing three","sensing urban","sta thematic","synthesizing insights","temporal trends","textual feedback","textual forms","thematic analytics","themes based","three essential","topics indicate","trend analysis","urban ground","various stakeholders","probabilistic topic","proposed framework","dirichlet allocation","latent dirichlet","urban planning","machine learning"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["ground sensing","topic modeling","accurately extract","aid planners","allocation importantly","analysis framework","analytics framework","benefit domain","detected topics","domain experts","efficiently analyze","essential methods","experiments indicate","extract precise","feedback analysis","feedback data","general feedback","geospatial information","geotagging topic","getting feedback","inform plans","information comes","interesting insights","involved getting","large amount","learning capabilities","methods geotagging","precise geospatial","proposed algorithm","read manually","rich information","routine work","semantic themes","sensing matters","sensing three","sensing urban","sta thematic","synthesizing insights","temporal trends","textual feedback","textual forms","thematic analytics","themes based","three essential","topics indicate","trend analysis","urban ground","various stakeholders","probabilistic topic","dirichlet allocation","latent dirichlet","proposed framework","urban planning","machine learning"]},{"DocId":579,"Year":2017,"Title":"The syntactic signature of starbucks' locations Towards a machine-learning approach to location decision-making","Abstract":"The space syntax Theory of Natural Movement postulates that everything else being equal, land use selects their location based on the asymmetry of accessibility created by the configuration of the street network. In this article, I test the hypothesis whether configurational (syntactic) properties of an urban street network are relevant for the location of land use. If syntactic features are relevant, then land use types may have a 'syntactic signature'. To identify this blueprint, I apply machine-learning techniques to datasets of syntactic measures, for ten business types. The results are ten models, each with the syntactic blueprint of a type of business. The models are used to predict the existence, or not, of such businesses in segments of the map of London. The performance of the models varies, with fifty per cent reaching statistical significance, including one with 'good' prediction ability. The models for Starbucks coffee shops and solicitor's offices have the strongest prediction ability. The exploratory exercise demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning method Random Forests, when supervised and individually applied to a business activity, to identify the syntactic signature of business types. Such models can be used during planning and design and on location studies. The results strengthen the candidacy of syntactic measurements to location-decision-making.

At the moment, depiction of the land surface temperature (LST) at city\/municipality scale particularly in certain areas of Misamis Oriental, Philippines is inadequate as support to efficient mitigations and adaptations of the surface urban heat island (SUHI). Thus, this study purposely attempts to provide application on the Landsat 8 satellite data and low density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) products in mapping out quality semi-Automated LST model and crop-level land cover classification in a local scale through theoretical and algorithm base approach utilizing the principle of data analysis subjected to object based model. The paper also aims to explore the relationship between the derived LST and land cover classification. The results of the presented model showed the ability of comprehensive data analysis, GIS functionalities and object based image analysis (OBIA) approach with the integration of machine learning intelligence on automating complex map production processes with considerable efficiency and high accuracy. The findings may potentially lead to expanded investigation of temporal dynamics of land surface UHI. It is worthwhile to note that the environmental significance of these interactions can provide microclimate perception, awareness and improved decision making for land use planning and characterization at local and neighborhood scale. As a result, it can aid in facilitating problem identification, support mitigations and adaptations more efficiently. \u00a9 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Al-Douri (2010) argued that conventional urban planning may lack adequate coverage of the essential design aspects of the built environment, which can be corrected by digital models and information technology tools that may help designers to visualize and interact with design alternatives and correct this problem. Following the work of Carmona and Punter (2002), Ai-Douri classified urban design aspects, such as urban form, townscape, public realm, conservation areas, land use, and landscape architecture. Under the multi-user architecture for team environments, the technical conditions for the implementation of cooperative design comprises both a visual representation and a semantic representation, as well as a shared workspace for shared understanding (Saad and Maher 1996). Meanwhile, research on online design tools has recently appeared in literature regarding coordination, collaboration, and communication in cooperative design (Klein 1995; Nurcan 1998; Okukuni et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2009) using virtual reality (VR). It is worthwhile to explore the prospect of online cooperative design as an application and extension of VR technology.

through AI approaches to the study of human living in space","Abstract":"Spatial environments have been studied by many scholars in different disciplines, and the present study aims at contributing to the broader discussion from an urban-planning view. Indoor and outdoor townscapes, because of their dynamic complexity, seem to offer ill-structured holds to the typical spatial behaviour of an agent, particularly when spatial behaviours is analyzed in mainstream AI robotics. Therefore, a question arises about the 'fundamentals' of spacescapes from the point of view of the needs of living agents, having to live in and move through them in resilient and intelligent ways. In this context, the subject of the present paper is the diagnosis and the control of a structured simple space, geometrically intended as the minimum arc of a graph. Conditions, situations, elements, behaviours are explored and partially analyzed in their spatial-temporal dimensions, subsequently aiming at setting up a system architecture to let spatial agents control their de-structuring impact. The research makes use of text analysis and interpretation, both applied to an in-class questionnaire survey, exploring low level (movement orientation) and high level (memories and fantasies) behaviours in human interaction with a space. The experiment is developed by relying on a large class of students from the Technical University of Bari, daily using a long and apparently amorphous corridor to reach lecturers' offices for advices, exams and explanations.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["advices exams","agent particularly","ai robotics","broader discussion","different disciplines","geometrically intended","human living","intelligent ways","lecturers offices","living agents","mainstream ai","makes use","partially analyzed","present paper","reach lecturers","research makes","space geometrically","space spatial","spatial behaviours","understanding townscapes","agents control","ai approaches","amorphous corridor","apparently amorphous","bari daily","complexity seem","conditions situations","daily using","dimensions subsequently","elements behaviours","exploring low","fantasies behaviours","graph conditions","high level","large class","level memories","level movement","low level","minimum arc","movement orientation","offer holds","outdoor townscapes","present study","question arises","questionnaire survey","simple space","situations elements","spatial environments","structured simple","study aims","subsequently aiming","survey exploring","system architecture","text analysis","typical spatial","using long","view indoor","dynamic complexity","human interaction","let spatial","spatial agents","spatial behaviour","technical university"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["advices exams","agent particularly","ai approaches","ai robotics","broader discussion","different disciplines","geometrically intended","human living","intelligent ways","lecturers offices","living agents","mainstream ai","makes use","partially analyzed","present paper","reach lecturers","research makes","space geometrically","space spatial","spatial behaviours","understanding townscapes","agents control","amorphous corridor","apparently amorphous","bari daily","complexity seem","conditions situations","daily using","dimensions subsequently","elements behaviours","exploring low","fantasies behaviours","graph conditions","high level","large class","level memories","level movement","low level","minimum arc","movement orientation","offer holds","outdoor townscapes","present study","question arises","questionnaire survey","simple space","situations elements","spatial environments","structured simple","study aims","subsequently aiming","survey exploring","system architecture","text analysis","typical spatial","using long","view indoor","dynamic complexity","human interaction","let spatial","spatial agents","spatial behaviour","technical university"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["advices exams","agent particularly","ai approaches","ai robotics","broader discussion","different disciplines","geometrically intended","human living","intelligent ways","lecturers offices","living agents","mainstream ai","makes use","partially analyzed","present paper","reach lecturers","research makes","space geometrically","space spatial","spatial behaviours","understanding townscapes","agents control","amorphous corridor","apparently amorphous","bari daily","complexity seem","conditions situations","daily using","dimensions subsequently","elements behaviours","exploring low","fantasies behaviours","graph conditions","high level","large class","level memories","level movement","low level","minimum arc","movement orientation","offer holds","outdoor townscapes","present study","question arises","questionnaire survey","simple space","situations elements","spatial environments","structured simple","study aims","subsequently aiming","survey exploring","system architecture","text analysis","typical spatial","using long","view indoor","dynamic complexity","human interaction","let spatial","spatial agents","spatial behaviour","technical university"]},{"DocId":593,"Year":2009,"Title":"The construction game","Abstract":"Technologies for video games have advanced dramatically over the past decade, revolutionising the motion picture, game and multimedia industries.

The interaction between land use and cover change, as a research field with the crossing of natural science and social science, has become one of core subjects of global change study as well as the front edge and hot point of it. It is necessary to develop research on land use and cover change in urbanization process and build an analog model of urbanization to carry out description, simulation and analysis on dynamic behaviors in urban development change as well as to understand basic characteristics and rules of urbanization process. This has positive practical and theoretical significance for formulating urban and regional sustainable development strategy. The effect of urbanization on land use and cover change is mainly embodied in the change of quantity structure and space structure of urban space, and LUCC model in urbanization process has been an important research subject of urban geography and urban planning. In this paper, based upon previous research achievements, the writer systematically analyzes the research on land use\/cover change in urbanization process with the theories of complexity science research and intelligent computation; builds a model for simulating and forecasting dynamic evolution of urban land use and cover change, on the basis of cellular automation model of complexity science research method and multi-agent theory; expands Markov model, traditional CA model and Agent model, introduces complexity science research theory and intelligent computation theory into LUCC research model to build intelligent computation-based LUCC model for analog research on land use and cover change in urbanization research, and performs case research. The concrete contents are as follows: 1. Complexity of LUCC research in urbanization process. Analyze urbanization process in combination with the contents of complexity science research and the conception of complexity feature to reveal the complexity features of LUCC research in urbanization process. Urban space system is a complex economic and cultural phenomenon as well as a social process, is the comprehensive characterization of urban society, economy and culture, and is a complex space system formed by society, economy and nature. It has dissipative structure characteristics, such as opening, dynamics, self-organization, non-balance etc. Traditional model cannot simulate these social, economic and natural driving forces of LUCC including main feedback relation from LUCC to driving force. 2. Establishment of Markov extended model of LUCC analog research in urbanization process. Firstly, use traditional LUCC research model to compute change speed of regional land use through calculating dynamic degree, exploitation degree and consumption degree of land use; use the theory of fuzzy set to rewrite the traditional Markov model, establish structure transfer matrix of land use, forecast and analyze dynamic change and development trend of land use, and present noticeable problems and corresponding measures in urbanization process according to research results. 3. Application of intelligent computation research and complexity science research method in LUCC analog model in urbanization process. On the basis of detailed elaboration of the theory and the model of LUCC research in urbanization process, analyze the problems of existing model used in LUCC research (namely, difficult to resolve many complexity phenomena in complex urban space system), discuss possible structure realization forms of LUCC analog research in combination with the theories of intelligent computation and complexity science research. Perform application analysis on BP artificial neural network and genetic algorithms of intelligent computation and CA model and MAS technology of complexity science research, discuss their theoretical origins and their own characteristics in detail, elaborate the feasibility of them in LUCC analog research, and bring forward improvement methods and measures on existing problems of this kind of model. 4. Establishment of LUCC analog model in urbanization process based on theories of intelligent computation and complexity science. Based on the research on abovementioned BP artificial neural network, genetic algorithms, CA model and multi-agent technology, put forward improvement methods and application assumption towards their expansion on geography, build LUCC analog model in urbanization process based on CA model and Agent model, realize the combination of learning mechanism of BP artificial neural network and fuzzy logic reasoning, express the regulation with explicit formula, and amend the initial regulation through self study; optimize network structure of LUCC analog model and methods and procedures of model parameters with genetic algorithms. In this paper, I introduce research theory and methods of complexify science into LUCC analog research and presents LUCC analog model based upon CA model and MAS theory. Meanwhile, I carry out corresponding expansion on traditional Markov model and introduce the theory of fuzzy set into data screening and parameter amendment of improved model to improve the accuracy and feasibility of Markov model in the research on land use\/cover change.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["urbanization process","lucc analog","complexity science","intelligent

Many GIS applications need more functions in analysis and decision-making than in data organization or visualization. While confronted with an application like planning a new metro line in a city, the typical GIS cannot accomplish it by itself, unless some human experts or artificial intelligence technology are involved. Numbers of GIS applications essentially are models of theme analyzing, and they are also examples of problem solving in AI. Therefore many theories and technologies from AI can be embedded in GIS to strengthen its ability of automatic analysis. Fortunately mathematical programming is a kind of powerful tool to settle problems with a demand of optimization under some constraint conditions. Many GIS applications happen to be this type, and some mathematical models can usually approximate them accurately. Two new questions aroused. The first is what objective function and constraint conditions that constitute a mathematical programming should be, and the second is how to acquire those mathematical expressions. Due to the establishment of a mathematical programming is highly knowledge-based, so an AI subsystem is designed to autonomously create a mathematical programming. This problem has a typical characteristic of multiple domains crossing from perspective of Knowledge Engineering, so some novel knowledge-processing methods, like knowledge dependence, knowledge transition and knowledge reference, are studied. And a knowledge system represented by frames and a reference-based knowledge-using method are presented here. \u00a9 2005 IEEE.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mathematical programming","gis applications","constraint conditions","theme analyzing","problem solving","accurately two","ai subsystem","analysis fortunately","application like","applications essentially","applications happen","automatic analysis","autonomously create","biggest challenge","constitute mathematical","create mathematical","data organization","dependence knowledge","domains crossing","expressions due","fortunately mathematical","gis problem","human experts","intelligence technology","involved numbers","knowledge dependence","knowledge reference","knowledge system","knowledge transition","like knowledge","like planning","mathematical expressions","methods like","metro line","model design","multiple domains","new metro","new questions","planning new","powerful tool","questions aroused","settle problems","solving nowadays","system represented","two new","typical characteristic","typical gis","usually approximate","knowledge engineering","mathematical models","novel methods","objective function","artificial intelligence"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mathematical programming","gis applications","constraint conditions","theme analyzing","problem solving","accurately two","ai subsystem","analysis fortunately","application like","applications essentially","applications happen","automatic analysis","autonomously create","biggest challenge","constitute mathematical","create mathematical","data organization","dependence knowledge","domains crossing","expressions due","fortunately mathematical","gis problem","human experts","intelligence technology","involved numbers","knowledge dependence","knowledge reference","knowledge system","knowledge transition","like knowledge","like planning","mathematical expressions","mathematical models","methods like","metro line","model design","multiple domains","new metro","new questions","planning new","powerful tool","questions aroused","settle problems","solving nowadays","system represented","two new","typical characteristic","typical gis","usually approximate","knowledge engineering","novel methods","objective function","artificial intelligence"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["mathematical programming","gis applications","constraint conditions","theme analyzing","problem solving","accurately two","ai subsystem","analysis fortunately","application like","applications essentially","applications happen","automatic analysis","autonomously create","biggest challenge","constitute mathematical","create mathematical","data organization","dependence knowledge","domains crossing","expressions due","fortunately mathematical","gis problem","human experts","intelligence technology","involved numbers","knowledge dependence","knowledge engineering","knowledge reference","knowledge system","knowledge transition","like knowledge","like planning","mathematical expressions","mathematical models","methods like","metro line","model design","multiple domains","new metro","new questions","novel methods","objective function","planning new","powerful tool","questions aroused","settle problems","solving nowadays","system represented","two new","typical characteristic","typical gis","usually approximate","artificial intelligence"]},{"DocId":597,"Year":2005,"Title":"The design of urban geographical information system for transportation","Abstract":"With the fast development of national economy and society, urban transportation has not been suitable for the current situation.

this paper, current recommendations for locating, designing, and operating Accident Investigation Sites (AISs) in urban freeway corridors are summarized. The recommendations are based on (a) interviews with freeway corridor traffic management teams in Texas and (b) experiences of the authors. The guidelines can be summarized as follows: The AIS locations must be easily accessible from the freeway. The most desirable location is within one block of the freeway exit ramp terminals. Local police should be involved in locating and esigning AISs. An AIS should be paved, illuminated, have a minimum of 1,000 ft2, and be equipped with some form of telephone communications system. It is better to install AISs as part of a citywide freeway incident management program involving traffic engineers and law enforcement personnel.","AuthorKeywords":null,"KMeans_Cluster_KeyTerms":["accident investigation","freeway corridors","investigation sites","urban freeway","ais locations","citywide freeway","communications system","corridor traffic","current recommendations","desirable location","easily accessible","enforcement personnel","esigning aiss","exit ramp","freeway corridor","freeway exit","freeway incident","incident management","install aiss","involving traffic","local police","locating designing","location design","management program","management teams","operating accident","paper current","paved illuminated","program involving","ramp terminals","sites aiss","telephone communications","terminals local","traffic engineers","law enforcement","traffic management"],"HDBSCAN_Cluster_KeyTerms":["accident investigation","freeway corridors","investigation sites","urban freeway","ais locations","citywide freeway","communications system","corridor traffic","current recommendations","desirable location","easily accessible","enforcement personnel","esigning aiss","exit ramp","freeway corridor","freeway exit","freeway incident","incident management","install aiss","involving traffic","local police","locating designing","location design","management program","management teams","operating accident","paper current","paved illuminated","program involving","ramp terminals","sites aiss","telephone communications","terminals local","traffic engineers","law enforcement","traffic management"],"Agglomerative_Cluster_KeyTerms":["accident investigation","freeway corridors","investigation sites","urban freeway","ais locations","citywide freeway","communications system","corridor traffic","current recommendations","desirable location","easily accessible","enforcement personnel","esigning aiss","exit ramp","freeway corridor","freeway exit","freeway incident","incident management","install aiss","involving traffic","local police","locating designing","location design","management program","management teams","operating accident","paper current","paved illuminated","program involving","ramp terminals","sites aiss","telephone communications","terminals local","traffic engineers","law enforcement","traffic management"]}]
