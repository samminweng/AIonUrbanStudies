festival and holiday event represented nouveau , alternative tourism ( cited in Lee et al.', ', 2008 ) .', 'How time have changed !', 'Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when , more than 20 year later , finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge .', 'Does this constitute progress ?', 'How do festival and event contribute to contemporary society ?', 'What has the remarkable rise in festival and event meant for the development of tourism destination ; for the development of economy , be they local , national or international ?', 'These and many other question preoccupy what is now an extremely large , international community of scholar from a range of discipline who adopt a variety of research approach to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebration at the heart of the diverse festival and event treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity , academic , policy and industry commentator everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in term of number , diversity and popularity has been enormous ( Getz , 1991 ; Finkel , 2009 ; Thrane , 2002 ) .', 'In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festival per year , attracting over 31 million visitor by the mid-1990s ( Janiskee , 1996 ; TIA , 2004 ) .', 'In Australia , the government notes that festival have become ubiquitous , with hundred being held every year ( Australian Government , 2012 ) .', 'In Europe , the growth has been similarly dramatic .', 'According to the International Festival and Event Association ( IFEA ) , the special event industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring event ( Wood , 2012 ) .', 'This significant growth in the practice of festival and event brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession .', 'It soon also brought a rise in academic interest : closely allied to the development of tourism study , academic began to take an interest in charting development in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 year .', 'Much of the research is published in tourism study and specific event-oriented journal , but it also finds expression in a wide range of journal dedicated to management and marketing , urban and place study , art and cultural policy , as well as many social sciences-oriented journal .', 'In the majority of case , festival and special event are presented as broadly positive phenomenon .', 'Throughout the literature , opening paragraphs emphasise the important role they play in advancing local and regional economy , branding place , attracting visitor , extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit .', 'Yet , festival and special event , the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial , complex and dynamic set of activity that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in country throughout the world .', 'In academia , they are studied from diverse management , social science and humanity perspective .', 'As such , interpretation of their impact and contribution to contemporary economy and society as well as approach to valuing , managing and shaping appropriate policy for their advancement are multiple and at time conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time .', 'Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge , the fracture between academic discipline and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields .', 'The literature on the Olympic Games , for example , is now in and of itself very substantial , yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other event that differ by scale and type is very unclear .', 'Getz and Andersson ( 2010 ) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researcher from many perspective : impact ( of varying type ) , place marketing , travel pattern , displacement effect , motivation , market segmentation , quality and satisfaction , regional development , relationship to urban renewal and development , and link to culture and community .', 'However , this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gap are closing in some area , they continue to open up elsewhere all the time .', 'This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concept that would seem very important in term of future development .', ""The concept of ‘ risk management ' , so important from an applied perspective , and that of ‘ emerging economy ' , so important from a geographical perspective , are two example of this.This volume is tasked with introducing , defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concept in the contemporary study of festival and event ."", 'While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of , or closely associated with , tourism study , in reality , it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline area .', 'It is well recognised that festival and special event are important from community , social , cultural , political and economic perspective .', 'Despite the growth and popularity of festival and special event , researcher were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impact and motivation ( Gursoy et al.', ', 2004 ) .', 'However , this imbalance is now being corrected .', 'The recent evolution of the academic study of festival and event can not be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism .', 'As theme of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism study , they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event study .', 'This link between the two area of study is very strong , with tourism study the primary field of enquiry and festival and event a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meaning , practice and policy associated with festival and event remains ongoing .', 'As this volume will show , the understanding of core concept remains uneven , and our knowledge of certain dimension of festival and event activity far exceeds that of

promote the growth of certain industry , second , aimed at minimizing the negative spatial effect generated by such growth .', 'In this sense , analyzing the policy implemented in the study area in question , it can be seen that : Policy promoting the knowledge economy have been implemented by organization and institution from different administrative level , gaining special relevance in the year before the crisis .', 'Nevertheless , the emergence of the crisis has truncated the growth coming to support these sector and has reduced the attention of current economic policy to promote the knowledge economy .', 'Consequently , the basis on which sits the economic development model of the metropolitan agglomeration of Seville are unchanged , so that it remains , above all , linked to the

of public policy to promote the development of knowledge economy in the metropolitan agglomeration of Seville does not seem to have achieved sufficiently energize .', 'Among the reason that may explain this circumstance can be highlighted : the own economic downturn resulting from the crisis , the austerity policy that have reduced public budget considerably in R+D , basic for the generation , transfer and adoption of knowledge , the rise of the value-added tax in the cultural and creative sector , as well as reducing state aid to these sector .', 'Regarding the spatial planning proposal there are some contradiction that challenge their potential contribution to territorial development .', 'For one , called attention to the large number of area of opportunity that are planned and the

the other , although it emphasizes the need to plan action at supralocal , each of the area of technological opportunity are located in a single municipality .', 'But the important thing is to design

space nor its description seems to be of much significance for American urban history .', 'What Wharton wrote about here , however , was Carrollton Gardens , a hotel in a landscaped setting created at the terminus of the streetcar line in the 1830s as an attraction to encourage the public to ride the streetcar and enjoy the refreshment and outdoor experience the garden offered.5 Such commercial space , together with similar example elsewhere in the country , are unexplored opportunity to investigate how nineteenth-century Americans perceived and used open spaces.Carrollton Gardens , in operation between 1835 and 1891 , falls midway in a continuum of similar commercial open space in New Orleans that offered food , outdoor recreation , or amusement , the earliest of which date from 1810 .', ""Sifting through seemingly unremarkable artifact of everyday life such as newspaper advertisement , periodical article , photographic image , and even sheet music , we find numerous

them , and the revenue they generate , the significance of pleasure garden as key precedent in the general evolution of these designed landscape becomes clear.7Substantial evidence , presented here

of marginal interest to landscape historian perhaps because the activity they offered are considered commonplace and therefore less worthy of study than more refined landscape expressions.8Five factor

activity rather than spatial order or design .', ""Second , designer of these space ( if we can even speak of them being `` designed '' ) remain anonymous ."", 'Third , pleasure garden were private

theater , and music ) that usually occurred during favorable weather condition ."", 'Similar attraction may have been present in public park on an occasional basis but were usually of less importance than the year-round active recreation and passive activity for which public park were designed .', 'Finally , a continuum leading from early pleasure gardens to more recent amusement park is not well established or widely acknowledged .', 'Early example have long since vanished , the prevailing secondary literature neglects them in favor of more prominent public park , and later amusement park generally do not figure significantly in contemporary discourse of public open spaces.9 As a consequence , pleasure garden have gone largely unstudied and underappreciated as a landscape typology.Nevertheless , a closer examination is warranted for several reason .', 'Pleasure garden precede other example of designed open space in America , and they occur much earlier than those well-documented effort , found from the mid-nineteenth century onward , to build public park in urban area .', ""They are different , in both form and content , from open space of the `` rural

expression in public project as the profession of landscape architecture evolved from its mid-nineteenth-century origins.Commercial pleasure garden are one of at least five open-space model found in nineteenth-century New Orleans .', ""As elsewhere , local pleasure garden were commercial place of public amusement , eating and drinking , sport , and entertainment , precursor to later `` concert

regarding admission.10 The first notice of a pleasure garden appears in a newspaper advertisement from 1810 in a new residential area upriver from the colonial community ; by the century 's end , pleasure garden had evolved into the suburban beer garden , performance venue , and amusement park of Spanish Fort and West End along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain , precedent for twentieth-century Pontchartrain Beach ( for white ) and Lincoln Beach ( for `` colored '' ) .11 Until now , New Orleans pleasure garden have been discussed briefly , first as performance venue within the context of the

place in the urban fabric ; and the cultural , social , and economic role they played in public life .', 'In addition , their nineteenth-century trajectory demonstrates how external factor related to race , economics , and cultural heritage influenced organization , use , and content of these privately owned open space .', ""Finally , information about local pleasure garden , seen as part of the larger context of open space in other nineteenthcentury American community , adds significantly to a broader knowledge of the country 's urban-landscape history.The map ( Figure 6.1 ) gives general

characterized theatrical attraction , musical entertainment , leisure activity , or decorative motif instead.Notably , the name of well-known European pleasure garden precedent occur locally in different location and at different time , suggesting both knowledge among local of European precedent and specific interest in using nominal association as a means of attracting customers.14 Notice
