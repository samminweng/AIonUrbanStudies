1,,2022,Article,Reconciling data-driven crime analysis with human-centered algorithms,"This study combines traditional statistical methods with machine learning to better understand locally relevant, contextual models for analyzing crime in two urban American cities. Using census tracts as the units of analysis and controlling for several structural characteristics associated with crime, we find that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, violent crime is associated with concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and spatial lag of violent crime. Yet, the most important variable is the spatial lag of violent crime, followed by residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and concentrated disadvantage. In addition, we find that in Chicago, Illinois, violent crime is associated with immigration, owner-occupied housing, proportion in professional occupations, and proportion population with college degree or higher, as well as ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and the spatial lag for violent crime. Machine learning models suggest that for Chicago's violent crime, the most important variable is the spatial lag term for violent crime, followed by total population, immigration, college education or beyond, owner occupancy, ethnic heterogeneity, and employment in professional occupations. The findings for property crime are similar: in Milwaukee, we find that disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population and spatial lag for property crime are significant predictors in the traditional regression models. However, the most important variable for property crime in Milwaukee is the spatial lag term, followed by total population, ethnic heterogeneity, residential stability and disadvantage. The statistically significant predictors of property crime in Chicago include immigration, owner-occupied housing units, living in the same house, proportion of workforce in professional occupations, college education and beyond, total population, and the spatial lag for property crime. In Chicago, the most important variable for property crime is the spatial lag term, then the total population, the proportion of individuals in professional occupations, concentrated immigration, college education and beyond, living in the same house, and the proportion of owner-occupied housing units. Urban planners must consider policies that can effectively reduce nearby crime and violence in all cities that experience high crime levels, but also design locally responsive policies that make sense within a local context: in Milwaukee, residential stability matters more for violent crime than for property crime, while in Chicago, total population is similarly important for both violent crime and property crime. In Milwaukee, ethnic heterogeneity is similarly important for violent and property crime, while in Chicago, ethnic heterogeneity is not a very important variable for violent crime and it is not a significant predictor of property crime. Therefore, urban policy must differently approach social disorganization indicators and support the nuances of the local context for urban planning and policy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Crime analysis; Machine learning; Social disorganization,"Clancy K., Chudzik J., Snowden A.J., Guha S.",10.1016/j.cities.2022.103604
12,,2022,Conference Paper,Investigation of Airflow around Buildings using Large-Eddy Simulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Applications,"The ever-increasing demand for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has led to the desire for integrating them into spaces in close proximity of humans like dense urban spaces, a reality previously thought of as inconceivable. One of the main concerns to be addressed before its widespread adoption is safety, especially in areas of operation adjacent to structures like buildings. This work investigates the effect of building geometries on the flow field in a simplified urban setup consisting of an isolated building to predict their potential impacts on UAS operations. Unanticipated wind gusts or turbulent flow conditions prevalent around various structures constitute a significant challenge for UAS operations in urban environments. We use Large-Eddy Simulation to better understand the unsteady and highly coherent turbulent flow structures produced by buildings in neutral atmospheric boundary layer flow. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a non-intrusive machine learning methodology to predict flow fields to augment safe wind-aware navigation systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a first step towards safely integrating UAS into existing aerial infrastructure. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

21,2.0,2022,Article,Do land policies make a difference? A data-driven approach to trace effects on urban form in France and Germany,"Against the backdrop of rapidly expanding urban structures, land policies in many countries have been adapted to contain and redirect growth to existing urban structures. However, obstacles remain to measure the effects of policies. In the meantime, geoinformation technologies have given rise to a wide range of approaches to measure and describe urban form. Nevertheless, its application for the assessment of land policy has a high, but not yet fully exploited, potential. It is thus the aim of this research to address and investigate the options of spatial analysis and machine learning in particular to analyse urban form from a land policy perspective. To do so, we develop urban metrics informed by urban planning and land readjustment policies of two countries describing urban form on different spatial levels. We therefore formulate hypotheses on causal relations between policy and form. Based on the metrics, we apply the random forest algorithm to classify the building stock of the region. We then extract the residential areas, those with single-family houses, as this is where the effects of the policy are considered most visible. In a next step, we use random forest to predict the nationality of a building. Through variable importance measures, we identify and discuss urban morphological differences between the two countries and test the hypotheses on effects of land policies. We develop and test the approach for the French-German city-region of Strasbourg using OpenStreetMap data. We identify significant differences in the building coverage ratios, which tend to be higher in Germany. This can be linked to differences in planning regulations. Furthermore, German residential areas appear to be more diverse in urban form. Differences in land readjustment policies have proven to be plausible here, as French policies favour strong actors that develop residential areas more uniformly. In Germany, policies favour fragmented ownership-oriented development of residential areas. The metrics and the applied algorithm for building classification have proven to be robust in terms of data heterogeneity and have shown high levels of accuracy. They could also be successfully used for tracing causal relations. © The Author(s) 2021.",Comparative; land policy; random forest; urban analytics; urban form,"Jehling M., Hecht R.",10.1177/2399808321995818
33,1.0,2021,Article,The influence of urban visuospatial configuration on older adults’ stress: A wearable physiological-perceived stress sensing and data mining based-approach,"Population ageing raises many fundamental questions, including how the urban environment can be configured to promote active ageing. The perceived element for older adults' involvement in the environment differs from the average person. Despite this difference, there is little to no research into understanding how the perceived elements (specifically, the visuospatial configuration) of the environment influence older adults' involvement—most studies focused on younger adults. The focus here is stress, which occurs when environmental demand exceeds a person's capability. As stress impacts a person's involvement in the environment and older adults are more likely to feel stress due to their decline in functional capability, it is important to understand how the visuospatial configuration of urban environment influence stress. Older adults were recruited to participate in an urban environment walk while their physiological responses (Photoplethysmogram) were monitored using wearable sensors. Their perceived stress responses were also collected. Spatial clustering and hot spot analysis were conducted to detect locations with clusters of physiological responses caused by spatial factors. These locations were subsequently labelled as stress or non-stress based on participants' perceived stress. The perceived visual elements of the urban environment were extracted using isovist analysis. Principal component analysis, self-organising map and machine learning algorithms were used to understand the relationship. The results demonstrate that isovist minimum visibility, occlusivity, and isovist area are the most influential determinants of older adults' physiological stress. Older adults prefer urban configurations where they can be seen. This study can be used to inform urban design and planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Isovist analysis; Machine learning; Older adult; Person-environment interaction; Physiological stress; Self-organising map,"Torku A., Chan A.P.C., Yung E.H.K., Seo J.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108298
36,,2021,Article,Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation and Prediction from Socioeconomic Variables Using Automatic Feature Selection Procedure-Based Machine Learning Model,"The origin-destination (OD) demand matrix plays an essential role in travel modeling and transport planning. Traditional OD matrices are estimated from expensive and laborious traffic counts and surveys. Accordingly, this study proposes a new combined methodology to estimate or update OD matrices (urban mobility) directly from easy-to-obtain and free-of-charge socioeconomic variables. The Málaga region, Spain, was used as a case study. The proposed methodology involves two stages. First, an automatic feature selection procedure was developed to determine the most relevant socioeconomic variables, discarding the irrelevant ones. Several feature selection techniques were studied and combined. Second, machine learning (ML) models were used to estimate mobility between predefined zones. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR) were tested and compared using the most relevant variables as inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model can be more accurate than traditional methods and ML models without the feature selection procedure. In particular, SVR with feature selection slightly outperformed the combined model using ANNs. The proposed methodology can be a promising and affordable alternative method for estimating OD matrices, reducing costs and lead time significantly, and assisting and improving urban transport planning. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Artificial neural networks; Feature selection; Machine learning; Origin-destination (OD) matrix; Support vector machines; Urban transport planning,"Rodríguez-Rueda P.J., Ruiz-Aguilar J.J., González-Enrique J., Turias I.",10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000763
53,1.0,2021,Article,Automated classification of building structures for urban built environment identification using machine learning,"The urban environment, especially buildings with different structure types, is difficult to identify automatically due to variation in urban function and form and to buildings’ relatively tacit structural attributes. To enable automated classification of building structures in complex urban environment, this study developed a machine learning (ML)-based method. Twenty-nine ML features were defined, and twelve popular ML algorithms were tested. The method was tested by classifying over 3700 buildings in Beijing, China into five common structures. Of the 12 ML algorithms, the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree delivered the highest overall performance, and its classification was verified as effective, i.e., achieving approximately 91.7%, 90.6%, and 91.1% of average recall, precision and F1, respectively, on testing data. This study's classification method helps establish a nexus among urban form, building structures, and materials and resource requirements, thus contributing to the advance of sustainable urban studies, such as urban metabolism and ecological planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Automated classification; Building structures; Built environment; Geographic information system; Machine learning; Urban form,"Zhou P., Chang Y.",10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103008
56,1.0,2021,Article,Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach,"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July–December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. © 2021 The Authors",Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning,"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148406
58,,2021,Article,Exploring the latent manifold of city patterns,"Understanding how cities evolve through time and how humans interact with their surroundings is a complex but essential task that is necessary for designing better urban environments. Recent developments in artificial intelligence can give researchers and city developers powerful tools, and through their usage, new insights can be gained on this issue. Discovering a high-level structure in a set of observations within a low-dimensional manifold is a common strategy used when applying machine learning techniques to tackle several problems while finding a projection from and onto the underlying data distribution. This so-called latent manifold can be used in many applications such as clustering, data visualization, sampling, density estimation, and unsupervised learning. Moreover, data of city patterns has some particularities, such as having superimposed or natural patterns that correspond to those of the depicted locations. In this research, multiple manifolds are explored and derived from city pattern images. A set of quantitative and qualitative tests are proposed to examine the quality of these manifolds. In addition, to demonstrate these tests, a novel specialized dataset of city patterns of multiple locations is created, with the dataset capturing a set of recognizable superimposed patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

61,3.0,2021,Article,Smart environment design planning for smart city based on deep learning,"Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods have contributed to the progression of models in the different aspects of planning, prediction, and uncertainty analysis of urban and smart cities development in the current scenario. Most developed cities have suffered from severe air quality as population growth and industrialization grow rapidly. Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods. © 2021",Deep learning; Smart City (SC); Smart environment design planning; Statistical model,"Liu L., Zhang Y.",10.1016/j.seta.2021.101425
64,2.0,2021,Article,Big data analytics for identifying electricity theft using machine learning approaches in microgrids for smart communities,"Electricity theft (ET) causes major revenue loss in power utilities. It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning,"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.",10.1002/cpe.6316
68,3.0,2021,Article,Geospatial simulation of urban neighbourhood densification potentials,"Although densification of urban areas is being proposed as a sustainable urbanisation strategy, frameworks for detailed large-scale analysis of densification potentials and their evaluation are lacking. A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4–15 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. © 2021 The Author(s)",Archetype; Compact city; Machine learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban structure unit,"Eggimann S., Wagner M., Ho Y.N., Züger M., Schneider U., Orehounig K.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103068
88,,2021,Article,Improving intelligent decision making in urban planning: Using machine learning algorithms,"Generally, decision making in urban planning has progressively become difficult due to the uncertain, convoluted, and multi-criteria nature of urban issues. Even though there has been a growing interest to this domain, traditional decision support systems are no longer able to effectively support the decision process. This paper aims to elaborate an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) that provides relevant assistance to urban planners in urban projects. This research addresses the use of new techniques that contribute to intelligent decision making: machine learning classifiers, naïve Bayes classifier, and agglomerative clustering.

109,1.0,2021,Article,A machine learning approach to the simulation of intercity corporate networks in mainland China,"This paper explores the potential of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the simulation of intercity networks. To this end, we implement the random forest MLA to simulate the intercity corporate networks created by Fortune China 500 firms in mainland China. The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940. Nonetheless, the random forest MLA also faces some challenges in the context of the simulation of intercity networks. We conclude that MLAs are potentially useful for specific applications such as the analysis of network big data, scenario simulation in regional planning, and the detection of driving forces in exploratory research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Intercity network; Machine learning; Modelling; Random forest; Simulation; Urban system,"Li L., Derudder B., Kong X.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101598
112,1.0,2021,Article,Online urban-waterlogging monitoring based on a recurrent neural network for classification of microblogging text,"With the global climate change and rapid urbanization, urban flood disasters spread and become increasingly serious in China. Urban rainstorms and waterlogging have become an urgent challenge that needs to be monitored in real time and further predicted for the improvement of urbanization construction. We trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging. The RNN model has been thoroughly evaluated, and our experimental results showed that it achieved higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Furthermore, we build a nationwide map of urban waterlogging based on recent 2-year microblogging data. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

121,4.0,2021,Review,Review of machine learning techniques for mosquito control in urban environments,"Machine learning (ML) techniques excel at forecasting, clustering, and classification tasks, making them valuable for various aspects of mosquito control. In this literature review, we selected 120 papers relevant to the current state of ML for mosquito control in urban settings. The reviewed work covers several different methodologies, objectives, and evaluation criteria from various environmental contexts. We first divided the existing papers into geospatial, visual, or audio categories. For each category, we analyzed the machine learning pipeline, from dataset creation to model performance. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for further research. While the reviewed ML methods in mosquito control are promising, we recommend a) increased use of crowdsourced and citizen science data, b) a standardized and open ML pipeline for reproducible results, and c) research that incorporates advances in ML. With these suggestions, ML techniques could lead to effective mosquito control in urban environments. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Dengue; Machine learning; Malaria; Mosquitoes; Urban data science; Vector control,"Joshi A., Miller C.",10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101241

166,,2021,Book Chapter,Planning Support Systems for Long-Term Climate Resilience: A Critical Review,"As climate change is becoming a reality, there is an increasing demand to improve urban resilience. Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience,"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.",10.1007/978-3-030-76059-5_24

199,17.0,2020,Review,The conceptual basis of water-energy-food nexus governance: systematic literature review using network and discourse analysis,"In the last decade, the debate on the governance of water, energy, and food (WEF) has intensified, spurring the emergence of the term “nexus governance.” In general, the reduction of trade-offs and construction of synergies between WEF have been placed on the scientific, political, and economic agenda. However, although increasingly used, it is difficult to find a clear meaning and definition of what the term represents. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), using text-mining and machine learning algorithms, this article investigates what are the conceptual basis of the nexus governance debate, and attempts to clarify the main themes, networks, and gaps within this literature. The analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative methods, combining social network analysis (SNA) and discourse analysis (DA). The results highlighted that twenty-four governance-related concepts support this literature, breaking down into eight groups: water and basin governance; environmental and systems governance; risk and resource security governance; economic governance; global governance; urban governance; integrative and cooperative governance; and “epistemic” and transdisciplinary governance. © 2020 The Author(s).

205,8.0,2020,Article,A data-informed analytical approach to human-scale greenway planning: Integrating multi-sourced urban data with machine learning algorithms,"Urban greenways have been recognized as an important strategy to improve human-scale quality in high-density built environments. Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Data-informed urban design; Greenway planning; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-sourced urban data,"Tang Z., Ye Y., Jiang Z., Fu C., Huang R., Yao D.",10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126871

This paper introduces the mathematical fusion model of Galileo and BeiDou satellite navigation system, typical urban coverage conditions are simulated, and a detailed in the aspects of number of visible satellites, positioning error and PDOP values are analysed. The results show that the positioning accuracy of the integrated navigation system in the horizontal is within 3 m, the elevation is within 5 m, and the PDOP value are less than 1.5 in the open sky condition. In any coverage conditions, Galileo stand-alone system cannot guarantee the positioning continuity in the whole day, and positioning performance is the worst in the north coverage condition, unable to obtain the position solutions for more than 40% time in the whole day. In the north coverage condition, BeiDou has the best positioning performance, with a minimum of 4 visible satellites and 99% of PDOP values are less than 10. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Wu Y., Yang Z., Xu N., Yu J.",10.1088/1742-6596/1550/3/032007
250,3.0,2020,Article,Design of machine learning model for Urban planning and management improvement,"With the aid of artificial intelligence, this paper builds a machine learning model with the KNN algorithm to optimize the traditional method of urban planning and management (UPM). The optimization is realized through two steps. First, the relevant theories of the updated UPM of livelihood oriented UPM (LOUPM) are explored for the later machine learning architecture design. People's livelihood has a great influence on UPM. Livelihood orientation makes the complex UPM even more complicated due to diverse living needs of citizens. This paper analyzes the deeper relationship between the people's livelihood and UPM, systematically studies the function and connotation of the people's livelihood behavior, and profoundly discusses current contradictions and restraining factors. Second, based on a better understanding of LOUPM, this paper further proposes an artificial intelligence approach to select most related factors to optimize UPM from databases. In the first paper of this series, in the analysis of the relevant UPM theories, three scopes of LOUPM are concluded to be the evaluation of data sets: authority, time, and space. Then, this paper continues to design a software model with the KNN algorithm to evaluate the urban plans and generates optimization advice for the user. Based on this research, it is possible to explore LOUPM. In order to make every effort to seek ways and methods to meet the challenge of the LOUPM in the new period, and by introducing a creative computing approach of government management and social governance, this article can contribute to the growing demand of China's urbanization process. © 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.

332,1.0,2019,Conference Paper,Intrusion Detection System as Audit in IoT Infrastructure using Ensemble Learning and SMOTE Method,"With the industrial revolution 4.0, the use of IoT-based systems is increasing, both in the field of health manufacturing, urban planning, housing, and even automotive. Therefore, the security of the IoT system needs to be considered, this is related to data integrity, privacy, service stability. Through intrusion detection, activities on the IoT system will be able to be analyzed whether there are suspicious activities that can interfere with or threaten IoT services. In several previous studies in the literature, the approach used to detect intrusions in the IoT system has a high false alarm rate. This research proposes an approach through machine learning, specifically the ensemble learning approach and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) method as a method of detecting intrusions in the IoT system which is expected to produce better performance. The results of this study indicate that the proposed approach is able to detect intrusion and classify into five types of intrusion including normal intrusion, probe, dos, r2l, u2r. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed approach can improve the performance of intrusion detection in terms of accuracy to 97.02%, detection rate of 97%, false alarm rate 0.16%, compared to base learning and approaches in previous studies used as intrusion detection methods, but in processing time performance have not shown satisfying results. © 2019 IEEE.",Audit; Ensemble learning; Intrusion Detection; IoT; Machine learning,"Kurniawan A.A., Santoso H.A., Soeleman M.A., Fanani A.Z.",10.1109/ICSITech46713.2019.8987524
369,3.0,2019,Article,Predicting safe parking spaces: A machine learning approach to geospatial urban and crime data,"This research aims to identify spatial and time patterns of theft in Manhattan, NY, to reveal urban factors that contribute to thefts from motor vehicles and to build a prediction model for thefts. Methods include time series and hot spot analysis, linear regression, elastic-net, Support vector machines SVM with radial and linear kernels, decision tree, bagged CART, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting. Machine learning methods reveal that linear models perform better on our data (linear regression, elastic-net), specifying that a higher number of subway entrances, graffiti, and restaurants on streets contribute to higher theft rates from motor vehicles. Although the prediction model for thefts meets almost all assumptions (five of six), its accuracy is 77%, suggesting that there are other undiscovered factors making a contribution to the generation of thefts. As an output demonstrating final results, the application prototype for searching safer parking in Manhattan, NY based on the prediction model, has been developed. © 2019 by the authors.",Crime prevention through urban planning; Geospatial data; Machine learning; Manhattan; Prediction model; Theft from motor vehicle,"Matijosaitiene I., McDowald A., Juneja V.",10.3390/su11102848
386,24.0,2019,Article,A reduced order model for turbulent flows in the urban environment using machine learning,"To help create a comfortable and healthy indoor and outdoor environment in which to live, there is a need to understand turbulent air flows within the urban environment. To this end, building on a previously reported method [1], we develop a fast-running Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Model (NIROM) for predicting the turbulent air flows found within an urban environment. To resolve larger scale turbulent fluctuations, we employ a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and solve the resulting computational model on unstructured meshes. The objective is to construct a rapid-running NIROM from these results that will have ‘similar’ dynamics to the original LES model. Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and machine learning techniques, this Reduced Order Model (ROM) is six orders of magnitude faster than the high-fidelity LES model and we demonstrate how ‘similar’ it can be to the high-fidelity model by comparing statistical quantities such as the mean flows, Reynolds stresses and probability densities of the velocities. We also include validation of the high-fidelity model against data from wind tunnel experiments. This paper represents a key step towards the use of reduced order modelling for operational purposes with the tantalising possibility of it being used in place of Gaussian plume models, and the potential for greatly improved model fidelity and confidence. © 2018",Gaussian process regression; Machine learning; Non-intrusive reduced order modelling; Operational modelling; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Urban flows,"Xiao D., Heaney C.E., Mottet L., Fang F., Lin W., Navon I.M., Guo Y., Matar O.K., Robins A.G., Pain C.C.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.035
399,,2019,Conference Paper,Intelligence augmentation for urban warfare operation planning using deep reinforcement learning,"The density, diversity, connectedness and scale of urban environments make military operations challenging. This paper shows that different artificial intelligence techniques can be combined to provide the commander with various form of intelligence augmentation and to support the decision making process. A warfare model has been developed where an AI system, representing a red unit, learns how to select the position for a target and for several improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in order to prevent the blue unit to locate the target. The blue unit is trained to reach the target by using deep reinforcement learning, while an evolutionary algorithm is used to train the red unit. These techniques do not rely on large amounts of historical data. Different approaches have been used and discussed to optimise the co-learning of the two agents, showing that optimal behaviour can be learned in an urban environment. Information about the most likely positions of the target and the IEDs can be extracted from the policy learned by the system, and used by the commander to provide intelligence augmentation while planning an operation and evaluating different possible courses of action. The reliability of this information depends on the realism of the AI system simulating the red unit, that is strictly dependent on the model used for the blue unit during the training. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

414,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,Automating layout synthesis with constructive preference elicitation,"Layout synthesis refers to the problem of arranging objects subject to design preferences and structural constraints. Applications include furniture arrangement, space partitioning (e.g. subdividing a house into rooms), urban planning, and other design tasks. Computer-aided support systems are essential tools for architects and designers to produce custom, functional layouts. Existing systems, however, do not learn the designer’s preferences, and therefore fail to generalize across sessions or instances. We propose addressing layout synthesis by casting it as a constructive preference elicitation task. Our solution employs a coactive interaction protocol, whereby the system and the designer interact by mutually improving each other’s proposals. The system iteratively recommends layouts to the user, and learns the user’s preferences by observing her improvements to the recommendations. We apply our system to two design tasks, furniture arrangement and space partitioning, and report promising quantitative and qualitative results on both.

These algorithms usually operate in a short-time analysis decomposing the incoming events in time and frequency domain. In this paper, an automatic sound recognizer is studied, which investigates audio events of interest from urban environment. Our experiments were conducted using a close set of audio events from which well known and commonly used audio descriptors were extracted and models were training using powerful machine learning algorithms.

564,26.0,2014,Article,A tool for urban soundscape evaluation applying Support Vector Machines for developing a soundscape classification model,"To ensure appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines,"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108

In this chapter, we introduce a novel data mining techniques and natural language processing approaches for automated detection student's personality and behaviors in an educational game (Land Science) where students act as interns in an urban planning firm and discuss in groups their ideas.

Rather than conventional counting by detection or regression/machine-learning methods, we propose an image retrieval approach, which uses an image descriptor to estimate the people count. We review the performance of several image descriptors. In addition, we propose a straightforward global image descriptor for image retrieval based on compressed sensing theory. Extensive evaluations on existing crowd analysis benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our image retrieval-based approach compared to state-of-the-art regression-based people counting methods. © 2014 IEEE.",compressed sensing; global image descriptor; people counting; sparse representation,"Foroughi H., Ray N., Zhang H.",10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854424

To better understand the conversational demands of mentors and players, this paper investigates the dynamics and linguistic features of multi-party chat in the context of an online educational game.
