1,,2022,Article,Reconciling data-driven crime analysis with human-centered algorithms,"This study combines traditional statistical methods with machine learning to better understand locally relevant, contextual models for analyzing crime in two urban American cities. Using census tracts as the units of analysis and controlling for several structural characteristics associated with crime, we find that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, violent crime is associated with concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and spatial lag of violent crime. Yet, the most important variable is the spatial lag of violent crime, followed by residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and concentrated disadvantage. In addition, we find that in Chicago, Illinois, violent crime is associated with immigration, owner-occupied housing, proportion in professional occupations, and proportion population with college degree or higher, as well as ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and the spatial lag for violent crime. Machine learning models suggest that for Chicago's violent crime, the most important variable is the spatial lag term for violent crime, followed by total population, immigration, college education or beyond, owner occupancy, ethnic heterogeneity, and employment in professional occupations. The findings for property crime are similar: in Milwaukee, we find that disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population and spatial lag for property crime are significant predictors in the traditional regression models. However, the most important variable for property crime in Milwaukee is the spatial lag term, followed by total population, ethnic heterogeneity, residential stability and disadvantage. The statistically significant predictors of property crime in Chicago include immigration, owner-occupied housing units, living in the same house, proportion of workforce in professional occupations, college education and beyond, total population, and the spatial lag for property crime. In Chicago, the most important variable for property crime is the spatial lag term, then the total population, the proportion of individuals in professional occupations, concentrated immigration, college education and beyond, living in the same house, and the proportion of owner-occupied housing units. Urban planners must consider policies that can effectively reduce nearby crime and violence in all cities that experience high crime levels, but also design locally responsive policies that make sense within a local context: in Milwaukee, residential stability matters more for violent crime than for property crime, while in Chicago, total population is similarly important for both violent crime and property crime. In Milwaukee, ethnic heterogeneity is similarly important for violent and property crime, while in Chicago, ethnic heterogeneity is not a very important variable for violent crime and it is not a significant predictor of property crime. Therefore, urban policy must differently approach social disorganization indicators and support the nuances of the local context for urban planning and policy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Crime analysis; Machine learning; Social disorganization,"Clancy K., Chudzik J., Snowden A.J., Guha S.",10.1016/j.cities.2022.103604
5,,2022,Article,A comprehensive study of the COVID-19 impact on PM2.5 levels over the contiguous United States: A deep learning approach,"We investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PM2.5 levels in eleven urban environments across the United States: Washington DC, New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Detroit, Phoenix, and Seattle. We estimate daily PM2.5 levels over the contiguous U.S. in March–May 2019 and 2020, and leveraging a deep convolutional neural network, we find a correlation coefficient, an index of agreement, a mean absolute bias, and a root mean square error of 0.90 (0.90), 0.95 (0.95), 1.34 (1.24) μg/m3, and 2.04 (1.87) μg/m3, respectively. Results from Google Community Mobility Reports and estimated PM2.5 concentrations show a greater reduction of PM2.5 in regions with larger decreases in human mobility and those in which individuals remain in their residential areas longer. The relationship between vehicular PM2.5 (i.e., the ratio of vehicular PM2.5 to other sources of PM2.5) emissions and PM2.5 reductions (R = 0.77) in various regions indicates that regions with higher emissions of vehicular PM2.5 generally experience greater decreases in PM2.5. While most of the urban environments ⸺ Washington DC, New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Seattle ⸺ show a decrease in PM2.5 levels by 21.1%, 20.7%, 18.5%, 8.05%, 3.29%, 3.63%, 6.71%, 4.82%, 13.5%, and 7.73%, respectively, between March–May of 2020 and 2019, Phoenix shows a 5.5% increase during the same period. Similar to their PM2.5 reductions, Washington DC, New York, and Boston, compared to other cities, exhibit the highest reductions in human mobility and the highest vehicular PM2.5 emissions, highlighting the great impact of human activity on PM2.5 changes in eleven regions. Moreover, compared to changes in meteorological factors, changes in pollutant concentrations, including those of black carbon, organic carbon, SO2, SO4, and especially NO2, appear to have had a significantly greater impact on PM2.5 changes during the study period. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model; COVID-19; Deep convolutional neural network; Google mobility reports; PM2.5 estimation; United States,"Ghahremanloo M., Lops Y., Choi Y., Jung J., Mousavinezhad S., Hammond D.",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.118944
7,,2022,Article,Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to Modeling Residential Infill Development in the City of Los Angeles,"While infill development is widely accepted by cities as an alternative to urban sprawl, a very dearth of research has attempted to measure infill development and identify contributing factors to infill development. Filling this research gap, this paper models residential infill development in the City of Los Angeles by employing five machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper attempts to identify the best-performing ML algorithms by comparing the performance of the ML algorithms. Of the five ML algorithms tested, the random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms are selected as the best-performing algorithms. The RF algorithm ranks independent variables from most to least important. Overall, the ranks suggested that residential infill development in the City of Los Angeles is significantly influenced by the physical conditions of property and neighborhood rather than socioeconomic characteristics. Diverse land uses, good housing mixes, and rail transit accessibility also, importantly, contributed to the infill development. This finding suggests that the city's planning efforts, such as the promotion of accessory dwelling unit (ADU) development and the expansion of rail transit, can create a virtuous circle for sustainable urban development. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Kim D., Shim J., Park J., Cho J., Kumar S.",10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000787
10,,2022,Review,Reconceptualizing urban heat island: Beyond the urban-rural dichotomy,"Past decades have seen drastically increasing research effort and progress on the study of the phenomenon of urban heat island (UHI). Despite its simplicity, this convenient concept has promoted significant advances in scientific research and policy making processes in the urban environmental community. Nevertheless, the oversimplification and inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy, inherited in the UHI concept, is increasingly manifest today in the continuously urbanized world. In this study, we conduct a holistic and in-depth survey of the inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy intrinsic to the definition of UHI, from theoretical, technical, and practical perspectives. In addition, in the light of recent research advances, we urge to radically reconceptualize UHI by proposing a novel paradigm by treating the total urban environment as a complex dynamic system. The new framework broadens the frontier of conventional urban environmental study by utilizing advanced techniques of complex systems and data sciences, including complex network theory, machine learning techniques, causal inference, etc. The reconceptualization of UHI is also expected to foster decision making and urban planning, and to avoid the one-sidedness of the singular and often too exclusive aim of heat mitigation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Complex urban system; Environmental sustainability; Mitigation and adaptation; Networks; Urban heat island,Wang Z.-H.,10.1016/j.scs.2021.103581
12,,2022,Conference Paper,Investigation of Airflow around Buildings using Large-Eddy Simulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Applications,"The ever-increasing demand for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has led to the desire for integrating them into spaces in close proximity of humans like dense urban spaces, a reality previously thought of as inconceivable. One of the main concerns to be addressed before its widespread adoption is safety, especially in areas of operation adjacent to structures like buildings. This work investigates the effect of building geometries on the flow field in a simplified urban setup consisting of an isolated building to predict their potential impacts on UAS operations. Unanticipated wind gusts or turbulent flow conditions prevalent around various structures constitute a significant challenge for UAS operations in urban environments. We use Large-Eddy Simulation to better understand the unsteady and highly coherent turbulent flow structures produced by buildings in neutral atmospheric boundary layer flow. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a non-intrusive machine learning methodology to predict flow fields to augment safe wind-aware navigation systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a first step towards safely integrating UAS into existing aerial infrastructure. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

14,,2022,Article,"A hybrid Daily PM2.5 concentration prediction model based on secondary decomposition algorithm, mode recombination technique and deep learning","Accurate and effective PM2.5 concentration prediction has important implications for public health and the ecological environment. To provide more accurate early warnings for haze prevention, urban planning, and people's travel planning, this paper proposes a new combined PM2.5 concentration prediction model. Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), followed by decomposition and reconstruction of the data by adaptive variational mode decomposition (AVMD) and sample entropy (SE), and then the reconstructed subseries are predicted by long and short-term memory networks (LSTM). The empirical analysis was carried out with three datasets from Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding, and the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The validity and robustness of the proposed model were verified, with R2 (0.982), RMSE (2.792), and MAPE (9.088%) being optimal in all comparison experiments. (2) The incorporation of secondary decomposition and pattern reorganization algorithms can effectively handle data with high volatility and non-linearity. (3) Compared with traditional machine learning models, the long and short-term memory network is more suitable for time series prediction. The model provides a novel and effective PM2.5 concentration prediction tool for the government and the public. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Adaptive variational mode decomposition; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Long short-term memory network; PM2.5 concentration prediction; Sample entropy,"Sun W., Xu Z.",10.1007/s00477-021-02100-2
15,,2022,Review,Automatic identification of addresses: A systematic literature review,"Address matching continues to play a central role at various levels, through geocoding and data integration from different sources, with a view to promote activities such as urban planning, location-based services, and the construction of databases like those used in census operations. However, the task of address matching continues to face several challenges, such as non-standard or incomplete address records or addresses written in more complex languages. In order to better understand how current limitations can be overcome, this paper conducted a systematic literature review focused on automated approaches to address matching and their evolution across time. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, resulting in a final set of 41 papers published between 2002 and 2021, the great majority of which are after 2017, with Chinese authors leading the way. The main findings revealed a consistent move from more traditional approaches to deep learning methods based on semantics, encoder-decoder architectures, and attention mechanisms, as well as the very recent adoption of hybrid approaches making an increased use of spatial constraints and entities. The adoption of evolutionary-based approaches and privacy preserving methods stand as some of the research gaps to address in future studies. © 2021 by the authors.

17,,2022,Article,Spatio-temporal prediction and factor identification of urban air quality using support vector machine,"Accurate air quality prediction can provide better supervision and reference for management policies. Due to difficulties in data acquisition, combined spatio-temporal prediction is still inconclusive. This study utilizes the support vector machine (SVM) method to predict air quality of unknown space and time. Extracted from a geographic information system (GIS), geographic features such as population, land use, economy, pollution sources, and terrain parameters were added to a time series. Temporal prediction was first executed in the reference stations, and the predicted air quality index (AQI) was then used to spatially infer the future AQI of unknown locations. Verification indicated high accuracy for short-term temporal prediction. Various meteorological and climatic effects were observed to be influential in seasonal difference. In the spatial inference stage, urbanization and city types were spatial features that appeared to impact air quality. Agriculture and forest use, transportation use, residential use, and economic factors were clearly correlated to AQIs, whereas population and labor force were not. This study establishes a prediction framework in northern Taipei based on SVM. Other locations can build their own models based on local actual data to achieve better decision-making, urban planning, or other applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Air quality prediction; Geographic information system; Machine learning; Spatio-temporal features; Support vector machine,"Liu C.-C., Lin T.-C., Yuan K.-Y., Chiueh P.-T.",10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101055
18,,2022,Book Chapter,Towards a Multi-agents Model for Automatic Big Data Processing to Support Urban Planning,"The objective of this paper was to propose a multi-agents model for automating big data processing, to improve the process of decision-making and urban planning. The huge amounts of collected data from different domains, such as urban management and remote sensing, are characterized as big data with a spatial component. Smart data is the approach to deal with big data characteristics and challenges by focusing on the Value aspect. The focus on smart data on the relevant data and the mechanism of automation and collaboration of the agents, will contribute to the efficient automating for big data analytics and processing. The proposed approach is based on a collection of agents, and adopt the concept of smart data, this paradigm focus on the aspect value from the big data and help to retrieve the useful information from the large volumes of data by intelligent processing. The proposed model describes the functionalities of the agents. The agents receive data in real time, perform the operations of storing data, pre-processing, streaming processing and batch processing and finally transfer the results of analysis to the services and applications. Machine learning techniques can be used to enhance the aspect of cognition of the agents; through a case study, we used supervised learning methods to build a classification model to support the process of urban planning by predicting the type of habitat adequate for the population based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Automation; Big data; Big data analytics; Decision-making; Machine learning; Multi-agent system; Smart data; Urban planning,"Sassite F., Addou M., Barramou F.",10.1007/978-3-030-80458-9_1
19,,2022,Article,Predicting citywide distribution of air pollution using mobile monitoring and three-dimensional urban structure,"Understanding relationships between urban structure patterns and air pollutants is key to sustainable urban planning. In this study, we employ a mobile monitoring method to collect PM2.5 and BC data in the city of Philadelphia, PA during the summer of 2019 and apply the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) methodology to examine relationships between urban structure and atmospheric pollution. We find that PM2.5 and BC vary by STURLA class, and some classes exhibit significant difference in pollution concentrations. We also find that the proportions in which STURLA components are present throughout the urban landscape can be used to predict the spatial distribution of urban air pollution. Among frequently sampled STURLA classes, gpl (grass, pavement, and low-rise buildings) hosted the highest PM2.5 concentrations on average (16.60 ± 4.29 µg/m3), while tgbwp (trees, grass, bare soil, water, pavement) hosted the highest BC concentrations (2.31 ± 1.94 µg/m3). Furthermore, STURLA combined with machine learning modeling was able to correlate PM2.5 (R2= 0.68, RMSE 2.82 µg/m3) and BC (R2 = 0.64, RMSE 0.75 µg/m3) concentrations with urban landscape composition and interpolate concentrations throughout the city. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the STURLA methodology in modeling relationships between air pollution and urban structure patterns. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Air pollution; Mobile monitoring; Spatial prediction; STURLA; Urban structure,"Cummings L.E., Stewart J.D., Kremer P., Shakya K.M.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103510
20,,2022,Article,Cultivating historical heritage area vitality using urban morphology approach based on big data and machine learning,"The conservation of historical heritage can bring social benefits to cities by promoting community economic development and societal creativity. In the early stages of historical heritage conservation, the focus was on the museum-style concept for individual structures. At present, heritage area vitality is often adopted as a general conservation method to increase the vibrancy of such areas. However, it remains unclear whether urban morphological elements suitable for urban areas can be applied to heritage areas. This study uses ridge regression and LightGBM with multi-source big geospatial data to explore whether urban morphological elements that affect the vitality of heritage and urban areas are consistent or have different spatial distributions and daily variations. From a sample of 12 Chinese cities, our analysis shows the following results. First, factors affecting urban vitality differ from those influencing heritage areas. Second, factors influencing urban and heritage areas' vitality have diurnal variations and differ across cities. The overarching contribution of this study is to propose a quantitative and replicable framework for heritage adaptation, combining urban morphology and vitality measures derived from big geospatial data. This study also extends the understanding of forms of heritage areas and provides theoretical support for heritage conservation, urban construction, and economic development. © 2021 The Authors",Heritage conservation; Historical heritage; Urban morphology; Urban planning; Vitality,"Wu J., Lu Y., Gao H., Wang M.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101716
21,2.0,2022,Article,Do land policies make a difference? A data-driven approach to trace effects on urban form in France and Germany,"Against the backdrop of rapidly expanding urban structures, land policies in many countries have been adapted to contain and redirect growth to existing urban structures. However, obstacles remain to measure the effects of policies. In the meantime, geoinformation technologies have given rise to a wide range of approaches to measure and describe urban form. Nevertheless, its application for the assessment of land policy has a high, but not yet fully exploited, potential. It is thus the aim of this research to address and investigate the options of spatial analysis and machine learning in particular to analyse urban form from a land policy perspective. To do so, we develop urban metrics informed by urban planning and land readjustment policies of two countries describing urban form on different spatial levels. We therefore formulate hypotheses on causal relations between policy and form. Based on the metrics, we apply the random forest algorithm to classify the building stock of the region. We then extract the residential areas, those with single-family houses, as this is where the effects of the policy are considered most visible. In a next step, we use random forest to predict the nationality of a building. Through variable importance measures, we identify and discuss urban morphological differences between the two countries and test the hypotheses on effects of land policies. We develop and test the approach for the French-German city-region of Strasbourg using OpenStreetMap data. We identify significant differences in the building coverage ratios, which tend to be higher in Germany. This can be linked to differences in planning regulations. Furthermore, German residential areas appear to be more diverse in urban form. Differences in land readjustment policies have proven to be plausible here, as French policies favour strong actors that develop residential areas more uniformly. In Germany, policies favour fragmented ownership-oriented development of residential areas. The metrics and the applied algorithm for building classification have proven to be robust in terms of data heterogeneity and have shown high levels of accuracy. They could also be successfully used for tracing causal relations. © The Author(s) 2021.",Comparative; land policy; random forest; urban analytics; urban form,"Jehling M., Hecht R.",10.1177/2399808321995818
24,1.0,2021,Article,Urban soils as a spatial indicator of quality for urban socio-ecological systems,"The development of criteria and indicators to quantify the transition to sustainability of the urban socio-ecological systems quality is determinant for planning policies and the 21st century urban agenda. This study models the spatial variation in the concentration and distribution of some macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients in the soil of a high-altitude city in the Andes. Meanwhile, machine learning methods were employed to study some interactions between the different dimensions that constitute an urban socio-ecosystem that caused these variations. We proposed a methodology that considered two phases: a) field work to collect data on 300 soil samples; laboratory analysis to measure the concentrations of 24 macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients; and the design of geophysical, spectral, and urban co-variables; b) statistical and geo-informatics analysis, where multivariate analysis grouped the elements into factors; and, machine learning integrated with co-variables was applied to derive the intensity of each factor across the city. Multivariate statistics described the variation in soil co-concentrations with a moderate percentage (42%). Four factors were determined that grouped some of the analyzed elements, as follows: F1 (Zn, S, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr), F2 (Ba, Ag, K, In, and Mg), F3 (B, V, Li, and Sr), and F4 (Si and Mn). The percentage R2 out-of-bag of the spatial model were: F1 = 20%, F2 = 8%, F3 = 14%, and F4 = 10%. Our outputs show that the enrichment and contamination by anthropogenic factors, such as the increase in population density, land use, road network, and traffic generated by fossil fuel vehicles, should be prioritized in urban planning decisions. © 2021",Andes; Cities; Environmental Quality; Machine learning; Volcanic urban soils,"Bonilla-Bedoya S., López-Ulloa M., Mora-Garcés A., Macedo-Pezzopane J.E., Salazar L., Herrera M.Á.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113556
25,,2021,Article,Data-based wildfire risk model for Mediterranean ecosystems-case study of the Concepción metropolitan area in central Chile,"Wildfire risk is latent in Chilean metropolitan areas characterized by the strong presence of wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs). The Concepción metropolitan area (CMA) constitutes one of the most representative samples of that dynamic. The wildfire risk in the CMA was addressed by establishing a model of five categories (near zero, low, moderate, high, and very high) that represent discernible thresholds in fire occurrence, using geospatial data and satellite images describing anthropic-biophysical factors that trigger fires. Those were used to deliver a model of fire hazard using machine learning algorithms, including principal component analysis and Kohonen self-organizing maps in two experimental scenarios: Only native forest and only forestry plantation. The model was validated using fire hotspots obtained from the forestry government organization. The results indicated that 12.3% of the CMA's surface area has a high and very high risk of a forest fire, 29.4% has a moderate risk, and 58.3% has a low and very low risk. Lastly, the observed main drivers that have deepened this risk were discussed: First, the evident proximity between the increasing urban areas with exotic forestry plantations and, second, climate change that threatens triggering more severe and large wildfires because of human activities. © 2021 Edilia Jaque Castillo et al.",,"Jaque Castillo E., Fernández A., Fuentes Robles R., Ojeda C.G.",10.5194/nhess-21-3663-2021
26,,2021,Article,Machine-learning models to replicate large-eddy simulations of air pollutant concentrations along boulevard-type streets,"Running large-eddy simulations (LESs) can be burdensome and computationally too expensive from the application point of view, for example, to support urban planning. In this study, regression models are used to replicate modelled air pollutant concentrations from LES in urban boulevards. We study the performance of regression models and discuss how to detect situations where the models are applied outside their training domain and their outputs cannot be trusted. Regression models from 10 different model families are trained and a cross-validation methodology is used to evaluate their performance and to find the best set of features needed to reproduce the LES outputs. We also test the regression models on an independent testing dataset. Our results suggest that in general, log-linear regression gives the best and most robust performance on new independent data. It clearly outperforms the dummy model which would predict constant concentrations for all locations (multiplicative minimum RMSE (mRMSE) of 0.76 vs. 1.78 of the dummy model). Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to detect concept drift, i.e. situations where the model is applied outside its training domain and a new LES run may be necessary to obtain reliable results. Regression models can be used to replace LES simulations in estimating air pollutant concentrations, unless higher accuracy is needed. In order to have reliable results, it is however important to do the model and feature selection carefully to avoid overfitting and to use methods to detect the concept drift. © 2021 Moritz Lange et al.",,"Lange M., Suominen H., Kurppa M., Järvi L., Oikarinen E., Savvides R., Puolamäki K.",10.5194/gmd-14-7411-2021
27,,2021,Article,Landslide susceptibility mapping using artificial neural network tuned by metaheuristic algorithms,"As a frequent natural disaster, landslides incur significant economic and human losses worldwide. The main idea of this paper is to propose novel integrative models for landslide susceptibility evaluation in a prone area of Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari Province in Iran. To do this, four metaheuristic techniques, namely chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), crow search algorithm (CSA), satin bowerbird optimization (SBO), and water cycle algorithm (WCA) are used to supervise the training of an artificial neural network (ANN). A spatial database is created by 170 historical landslides and 14 most common conditioning factors. The models are optimized in terms of hyper-parameters and elite ones are then used to produce the susceptibility maps. During the training phase, all models could acquire a reliable understanding of the landslide pattern. The obtained accuracy index of area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that the maps produced by the WCA-ANN (AUROC = 0.925) and SBO-ANN (AUROC = 0.900) are more accurate than those of the ChOA-ANN (AUROC = 0.851) and CSA-ANN (AUROC = 0.855). Considering this assessment, the suggested hybrid models are reliable enough for landslide susceptibility modeling. Accordingly, the generated susceptibility map can be used for urban planning and generating alert systems over the studied area. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Landslide; Machine learning; Metaheuristic optimization; Natural hazard; Susceptibility modeling,"Mehrabi M., Moayedi H.",10.1007/s12665-021-10098-7
28,,2021,Review,Artificial intelligence in urban forestry—A systematic review,"Environmental quality and the citizens' well-being largely depend on the urban forests. But managing this natural capital is challenging for its biological complexity and interactions with other environmental, social, and economic aspects of the cities. In line with the current digital revolution with the rise of Smart Cities, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more common, including in urban forestry. In this systematic review, we evaluated 67 studies on the interplay between AI and urban forestry surveyed on Science Direct and Scopus to provide an overview of the state of the art and identify new research avenues. The sample includes studies in 23 countries and 85 cities, including 5 megacities, comprising the remote assessment of canopy cover and species distribution; ecosystem services assessment; management practices; and socioeconomic aspects of urban forestry. Most studies focused on extant urban forests, with few examples evaluating temporal trends, and only one focused on future scenarios despite the predictive potential of AI. A total of 22 AI methods were employed in these studies. Only half of them point to clear advantages of the chosen methods, such as robustness against missing data, overfitting, collinearity, non-linearity, non-normality, the combination of discrete and continuous variables, and higher accuracy. The choice of these methods depends on the various combinations of aim, timescale, data type, and data source. The application of AI in urban forestry is in full growth and will support decision making to improve livability in the cities. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH",Deep learning; Governance; Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Nature-based solutions; Urban planning; Urban trees,"César de Lima Araújo H., Silva Martins F., Tucunduva Philippi Cortese T., Locosselli G.M.",10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127410

Parametric solar radiation simulations are conducted by varying the urban canyon geometry, orientation and surface reflectance. The study proposes the Solar Irradiation Ratio (SIR) and develops a qualitative classification scheme for solar exposure and irradiation uniformity in order to compare simulation results from different cities and label each urban canyon surface accordingly. Finally, the study trains and tests Random Forest classifiers which enable the quick classification of any symmetrical canyon geometry by providing canyon geometry, orientation and surface reflectance as inputs. Testing reveals that the classifiers have decent performance (accuracy: 0.89 – 0.94, precision: 0.82 – 0.92) and consequently may be used in early urban design and planning studies to get a quick estimate of the solar performance of a given symmetrical urban canyon, before full-scale simulations take place. © 2021",Classification; Machine Learning; Reflectance; Simulation; Solar radiation; Urban canyon,Vartholomaios A.,10.1016/j.scs.2021.103379
33,1.0,2021,Article,The influence of urban visuospatial configuration on older adults’ stress: A wearable physiological-perceived stress sensing and data mining based-approach,"Population ageing raises many fundamental questions, including how the urban environment can be configured to promote active ageing. The perceived element for older adults' involvement in the environment differs from the average person. Despite this difference, there is little to no research into understanding how the perceived elements (specifically, the visuospatial configuration) of the environment influence older adults' involvement—most studies focused on younger adults. The focus here is stress, which occurs when environmental demand exceeds a person's capability. As stress impacts a person's involvement in the environment and older adults are more likely to feel stress due to their decline in functional capability, it is important to understand how the visuospatial configuration of urban environment influence stress. Older adults were recruited to participate in an urban environment walk while their physiological responses (Photoplethysmogram) were monitored using wearable sensors. Their perceived stress responses were also collected. Spatial clustering and hot spot analysis were conducted to detect locations with clusters of physiological responses caused by spatial factors. These locations were subsequently labelled as stress or non-stress based on participants' perceived stress. The perceived visual elements of the urban environment were extracted using isovist analysis. Principal component analysis, self-organising map and machine learning algorithms were used to understand the relationship. The results demonstrate that isovist minimum visibility, occlusivity, and isovist area are the most influential determinants of older adults' physiological stress. Older adults prefer urban configurations where they can be seen. This study can be used to inform urban design and planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Isovist analysis; Machine learning; Older adult; Person-environment interaction; Physiological stress; Self-organising map,"Torku A., Chan A.P.C., Yung E.H.K., Seo J.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108298
34,,2021,Article,Identifying urban built environment factors in pregnancy care and maternal mental health outcomes,"Backgrounds: Risk factors related to the built environment have been associated with women’s mental health and preventive care. This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients’ residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients’ residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Results: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. Conclusions: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD. Findings may inform urban design policies and provide awareness for care providers on the association of patients’ residing neighborhoods and healthy pregnancy. © 2021, The Author(s).",Built environment; Postpartum depression; Pregnancy care,"Zhang Y., Tayarani M., Wang S., Liu Y., Sharma M., Joly R., RoyChoudhury A., Hermann A., Gao O.H., Pathak J.",10.1186/s12884-021-04056-1
36,,2021,Article,Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation and Prediction from Socioeconomic Variables Using Automatic Feature Selection Procedure-Based Machine Learning Model,"The origin-destination (OD) demand matrix plays an essential role in travel modeling and transport planning. Traditional OD matrices are estimated from expensive and laborious traffic counts and surveys. Accordingly, this study proposes a new combined methodology to estimate or update OD matrices (urban mobility) directly from easy-to-obtain and free-of-charge socioeconomic variables. The Málaga region, Spain, was used as a case study. The proposed methodology involves two stages. First, an automatic feature selection procedure was developed to determine the most relevant socioeconomic variables, discarding the irrelevant ones. Several feature selection techniques were studied and combined. Second, machine learning (ML) models were used to estimate mobility between predefined zones. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR) were tested and compared using the most relevant variables as inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model can be more accurate than traditional methods and ML models without the feature selection procedure. In particular, SVR with feature selection slightly outperformed the combined model using ANNs. The proposed methodology can be a promising and affordable alternative method for estimating OD matrices, reducing costs and lead time significantly, and assisting and improving urban transport planning. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Artificial neural networks; Feature selection; Machine learning; Origin-destination (OD) matrix; Support vector machines; Urban transport planning,"Rodríguez-Rueda P.J., Ruiz-Aguilar J.J., González-Enrique J., Turias I.",10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000763
39,,2021,Conference Paper,"High-resolution air temperature mapping in a data-scarce, arid area by means of low-cost mobile measurements and machine learning","The availability of gridded, screen-level air temperature data at an effective spatial and temporal resolution is important for many fields such as climatology, ecology, urban planning and design. This study aims at providing such data in a data-scarce, arid city within the greater Cairo region (Egypt), namely the Sixth of October, where, to our knowledge, no such data are available. By using (i) air temperature data, collected from mobile measurements, (ii) multiple spectral indices, (iii) spatial analysis techniques and (iv) random forest regression modelling, we produced air temperature maps (for both daytime and nighttime) at 30-m spatial resolution for the entire city. The proposed method is systematic and relies on low-cost instrumentation and freely-available satellite data and hence it can be replicated in similar data-scarce, arid areas to allow for better spatial and temporal monitoring of air temperature. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.",,"Eldesoky A.H.M., Colaninno N., Morello E.",10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012045
40,,2021,Conference Paper,A machine-learning model for the prediction of aggregated building heating demand from pan-European land-use maps,"Aggregated building energy demand is a useful indicator for urban energy planning. It can be used by planners and decision-makers to identify clusters of high energy demand in a given urban area and efficiently plan, for example, district heating networks. Various data sources exist at the pan-European level describing land use and built areas. Combined with statistical data, such maps have been used in previous research for estimating building energy performance aggregated at the hectare level, using engineering assumptions. In this paper, we show that large-scale land-use maps alone can be used for predicting annual building energy demand with an accuracy comparable to the one of previous engineering models. We hence present a preliminary method based on Convolutional Neural Networks at different spatial resolutions. The resulting model was trained and tested in an area of about 170 km2 in Geneva (Switzerland) using a local annual heating demand dataset comprising 16239 buildings. On a 300-m aggregation tile, the obtained mean error (14.3%) is significantly reduced compared to the one of a simple linear model (37.2%). Using solely land-use data, we also achieve similar results for a 100-m tile as those of an engineering model from the literature. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.",,"Peronato G., Boghetti R., Kämpf J.H.",10.1088/1742-6596/2042/1/012019
41,,2021,Article,National Empirical Models of Air Pollution Using Microscale Measures of the Urban Environment,"National-scale empirical models of air pollution (e.g., Land Use Regression) rely on predictor variables (e.g., population density, land cover) at different geographic scales. These models typically lack microscale variables (e.g., street level), which may improve prediction with fine-spatial gradients. We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K). We compared predictor variables (e.g., traditional vs microscale) and emerging modeling approaches (ML-K) to well-established approaches (i.e., traditional variables in a PLS-K or SW-K framework). We found that combined predictor variables (traditional + microscale) in the ML-K models outperformed the well-established approaches (10-fold spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 increased 0.02-0.42 [average: 0.19] among six criteria pollutants). Comparing all model types using microscale variables to models with traditional variables, the performance is similar (average difference of 10-fold spatial CV R2 = 0.05) suggesting microscale variables are a suitable substitute for traditional variables. ML-K and microscale variables show promise for improving national empirical models. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",Empirical models; exposure assessment; machine learning; street-level features; urban form,"Lu T., Marshall J.D., Zhang W., Hystad P., Kim S.-Y., Bechle M.J., Demuzere M., Hankey S.",10.1021/acs.est.1c04047
43,1.0,2021,Article,An end-to-end point of interest (Poi) conflation framework,"Point of interest (POI) data serves as a valuable source of semantic information for places of interest and has many geospatial applications in real estate, transportation, and urban planning. With the availability of different data sources, POI conflation serves as a valuable technique for enriching data quality and coverage by merging the POI data from multiple sources. This study proposes a novel end-to-end POI conflation framework consisting of six steps, starting with data procurement, schema standardisation, taxonomy mapping, POI matching, POI unification, and data verification. The feasibility of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study conducted in the eastern region of Singapore, where the POI data from five data sources was conflated to form a unified POI dataset. Based on the evaluation conducted, the resulting unified dataset was found to be more comprehensive and complete than any of the five POI data sources alone. Furthermore, the proposed approach for identifying POI matches between different data sources outperformed all baseline approaches with a matching accuracy of 97.6% with an average run time below 3 min when matching over 12,000 POIs to result in 8699 unique POIs, thereby demonstrating the framework’s scalability for large scale implementation in dense urban contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

44,,2021,Article,Machine learning simulation of land cover impact on surface urban heat island surrounding park areas,"The urban heat island effect has been studied extensively by many researchers around the world with the process of urbanization coming about as one of the major culprits of the increasing urban land surface temperatures. Over the past 20 years, the city of Dallas, Texas, has consistently been one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and has faced rapid urbanization and great amounts of urban sprawl, leading to an increase in built-up surface area. In this study, we utilize Landsat 8 satellite images, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, land use/land cover (LULC) data, and a state-of-the-art methodology combining machine learning algorithms (eX-treme Gradient Boosted models, or XGBoost) and a modern game theoretic-based approach (Shap-ley Additive exPlanation, or SHAP values) to investigate how different land use/land cover classi-fications impact the land surface temperature and park cooling effects in the city of Dallas. We con-clude that green spaces, residential, and commercial/office spaces have the largest impacts on Land Surface Temperatures (LST) as well as the Park’s Cooling Intensity (PCI). Additionally, we have found that the extent and direction of influence of these categories depends heavily on the surrounding area. By using SHAP values we can describe these interactions in greater detail than pre-vious studies. These results will provide an important reference for future urban and park place-ment planning to minimize the urban heat island effect, especially in sprawling cities. © 2021 by the authors.

45,,2021,Article,Uncovering the nature of urban land use composition using multi-source open big data with ensemble learning,"Detailed information on urban land uses has been an essential requirement for urban land management and policymaking. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning technologies have contributed to the mapping and monitoring of multi-scale urban land uses, yet there lacks a holistic mapping framework that is compatible with different end users’ demands. Moreover, land use mix has evolved to be a key component in modern urban settings, but few have explicitly measured the spatial complexity of land use or quantitively uncovered its driving forces. Addressing these challenges, here we developed a novel two-stage bottom-up scheme for mapping essential urban land use categories. In the first stage, we conducted object-based land use classification using crowdsourcing features derived from multi-source open big data and an automated ensemble learning approach. In the second stage, we identified parcel-based land use attributes, including the dominant type and mixture mode, by spatially correlating land parcels with the object-based results. Furthermore, we investigated the potential influencing factors of land use mix using principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. Experimental results in Ningbo, a coastal city in China, showed that the proposed framework could accurately depict the distribution and composition of urban land uses. At the object scale, the highest classification accuracy was as high as 86% and 78% for the major (Level I) and minor (Level II) categories, respectively. At the parcel scale, the generated land use maps were spatially consistent with the object-based maps. We found larger parcels were more likely to be mixed in land use, and industrial lands were characterized as the most complicated category. We also identified multiple factors that had a collective impact on land use mix, including geography, socioeconomy, accessibility, and landscape metrics. Altogether, our proposed framework offered an alternative to investigating urban land use composition, which could be applied in a broad range of implications in future urban studies. © 2021 by the authors.

47,1.0,2021,Article,Prediction of crime rate in urban neighborhoods based on machine learning,"As the impact of crime on the lives of residents has increased, there are a number of methods for predicting where crime will occur. They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan. In addition the ideas in this paper can be applied as a set of methodologies to predict other relevant urban characteristic parameters and visualize them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Big data analysis; Crime rate; Machine learning; Urban design,"He J., Zheng H.",10.1016/j.engappai.2021.104460
50,1.0,2021,Article,Nonlinear relationship between urban form and street-level PM2.5 and CO based on mobile measurements and gradient boosting decision tree models,"Exposure to PM2.5 and CO has been proven to be closely related to physical health. Since 2012, they have been added to the pollutant list for national monitoring in Wuhan. However, the fine-scale variation in pollution, especially at the street level, is complex and requires further exploration. In this study, the influence of urban form on the street-level air pollution distribution was comprehensively assessed according to the urban factors, high-resolution meteorological data, PM2.5 and CO concentration data collected via mobile monitoring along roads in Wuhan. Furthermore, potential urban factors, including the land-use and urban form characteristics, were obtained from geographic information system. Both linear regression and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models were developed to explore the relationship between the observed concentrations and the predictor variables. The modeling results demonstrate that the GBDT model, which captured the non-linear relationship, helps to better explain more of the variations in the pollutant concentrations than the linear model. This study provides insights into machine learning models for pollution prediction and demonstrate the important relationship between urban form and street-level pollutants. The results suggest that the urban form of the podium-level porosity can be set higher than 0.7 to promote the ventilation of street-level PM2.5 and CO, building density can be less than 0.35, and the standard deviation of height can be set to ~10 m in central Wuhan to mitigate street-level PM2.5. Thus, quantitatively demonstrating the impact of urban form on the PM2.5 and CO concentrations can help decision-makers with urban planning and management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); Machine learning; Street-level air pollution; Urban form,"Liu M., Chen H., Wei D., Wu Y., Li C.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108265
53,1.0,2021,Article,Automated classification of building structures for urban built environment identification using machine learning,"The urban environment, especially buildings with different structure types, is difficult to identify automatically due to variation in urban function and form and to buildings’ relatively tacit structural attributes. To enable automated classification of building structures in complex urban environment, this study developed a machine learning (ML)-based method. Twenty-nine ML features were defined, and twelve popular ML algorithms were tested. The method was tested by classifying over 3700 buildings in Beijing, China into five common structures. Of the 12 ML algorithms, the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree delivered the highest overall performance, and its classification was verified as effective, i.e., achieving approximately 91.7%, 90.6%, and 91.1% of average recall, precision and F1, respectively, on testing data. This study's classification method helps establish a nexus among urban form, building structures, and materials and resource requirements, thus contributing to the advance of sustainable urban studies, such as urban metabolism and ecological planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Automated classification; Building structures; Built environment; Geographic information system; Machine learning; Urban form,"Zhou P., Chang Y.",10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103008

Researchers have applied machine learning models to generate 2D drawings with pixels or 3D models with voxels, but the pixelization reduces the precision of the geometries. Therefore, in order to learn and generate 3D geometries as vectorized models with higher precision and faster computation speed, we develop a specific artificial neural network, learning and generating design features for the forms of buildings. A customized data structure with feature parameters is constructed, meeting the requirements of the neural network by rebuilding surfaces with controlling points and appending additional input neurons as quantified vectors to describe the properties of the design. The neural network is first trained with generated design data and then tested by adjusting the feature parameters. The prediction of the generated data shows the basic generative ability of the neural network. Furthermore, trained with design data collected from existing buildings, the neural network learns and infers the geometric design features of architectural design with different feature parameters, providing a data-driven method for designers to generate and analyze architectural forms. © 2021 The Authors",Architectural form finding; Artificial neural networks; Computational design; Machine learning,"Zheng H., Yuan P.F.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108178
56,1.0,2021,Article,Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach,"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July–December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. © 2021 The Authors",Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning,"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148406
57,,2021,Review,Changes in the Urban Surface Thermal Environment of a Chinese Coastal City Revealed by Downscaling MODIS LST with Random Forest Algorithm,"Analysis of the formation and evolution of urban surface thermal environment is crucial for urban planning and improving the environment of a settlement. Qingdao was selected in this study as a typical coastal city undergoing rapid urbanization, and the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of its urban surface thermal environment from 2010 to 2019 were evaluated. The random forest (RF) algorithm was adopted to obtain its land surface temperature (LST) map with 30-m resolution by downscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product; the remote sensing indices emphasizing different land cover types, LST calculated by the radiative transfer equation, and elevation were used as input variables in the algorithm. The heat island intensity (HII), urban heat island (UHI) volume, and UHI grade were used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of the urban surface thermal environment in Qingdao. The results show an increasing trend in average HII between 1.1 and 2.52°C in the study area over the past 10 years. The northern city appeared to have the highest UHI volume, while change of the UHI volume in Huangdao District of southwestern Qingdao was the most significant. The areas with high HII have gradually expanded during the last 10 years, and the areas with a 10-yr persistently high HII are distributed mainly in old urban areas with high building density and a dense population. Different factors may influence UHI, such as artificial heat sources, surface heat sources, and hybrid heat sources. Finally, adjusting the urban structure, increasing the vegetated area, and changing building colors are proposed to mitigate UHI in the areas with continuously high HII. © 2021, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",coastal city; downscaling; random forest; surface thermal environment; urban heat island,"Xu N., Deng F., Liu B., Li C., Fu H., Yang H., Zhang J.",10.1007/s13351-021-0023-4
58,,2021,Article,Exploring the latent manifold of city patterns,"Understanding how cities evolve through time and how humans interact with their surroundings is a complex but essential task that is necessary for designing better urban environments. Recent developments in artificial intelligence can give researchers and city developers powerful tools, and through their usage, new insights can be gained on this issue. Discovering a high-level structure in a set of observations within a low-dimensional manifold is a common strategy used when applying machine learning techniques to tackle several problems while finding a projection from and onto the underlying data distribution. This so-called latent manifold can be used in many applications such as clustering, data visualization, sampling, density estimation, and unsupervised learning. Moreover, data of city patterns has some particularities, such as having superimposed or natural patterns that correspond to those of the depicted locations. In this research, multiple manifolds are explored and derived from city pattern images. A set of quantitative and qualitative tests are proposed to examine the quality of these manifolds. In addition, to demonstrate these tests, a novel specialized dataset of city patterns of multiple locations is created, with the dataset capturing a set of recognizable superimposed patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

60,3.0,2021,Article,Evaluating the role of urban fabric on surface urban heat island: The case of Istanbul,"Urban heat islands, one of the fundamental anthropogenic impacts on local climates, have been a growing concern especially for high-density urban areas such as Istanbul. This paper outlines the use of a supervised machine learning technique to understand the effects of the urban fabric on surface urban heat island (SUHI) formation in Istanbul, and identify effective variables to provide a basis for research and practice focusing on SUHI mitigation. An analysis using the Ridge Regression Model found that 71% of land surface temperature anomalies in Istanbul are linked to building coverage ratio (BCR), surface/volume ratio (SVR), sky-view factor (SVF), canyon geometry factor (CGF), and vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI and BCR were the urban fabric components with the highest contribution to SUHI formation, while the effects of SVF and CGF remained relatively low. This research can help planners and designers gauge the contribution of the urban fabric to micro-climate issues and adapt SUHI mitigation strategies for projects aiming to build climate-sensitive urban environments. It also provides insight into and improves knowledge of supervised machine learning approaches to the urban planning and design disciplines. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Istanbul; Land surface temperature; Ridge regression model; Surface urban heat island; Urban fabric,"Erdem Okumus D., Terzi F.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103128

Most developed cities have suffered from severe air quality as population growth and industrialization grow rapidly. Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods. © 2021",Deep learning; Smart City (SC); Smart environment design planning; Statistical model,"Liu L., Zhang Y.",10.1016/j.seta.2021.101425
62,,2021,Article,DTEx: A dynamic urban thermal exposure index based on human mobility patterns,"Background: Extreme heat in light of climate change is increasingly threatening the health and comfort of urban residents. Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of heat exposure is a critical factor in directing mitigation measures. Current heat vulnerability indices provide insight into heat sensitivities within given communities but do not account for the dynamic nature of the human movement as people travel for different activities. Here, we present a new Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure index (DTEx) that captures the varying heat exposure within urban environments. Methods: We developed the DTEx to understand human heat exposure patterns in a mid-sized city. This index incorporates the human movement pattern and the heat hazard pattern obtained via novel and advanced techniques. We generated the human movement pattern from large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data. The heat hazard patterns were extrapolated via machine learning models from air temperature data measured through vehicle-mounted sensors. The exposure index was then developed by combining the two parameters using their standard-deviation-classified indices. Results: Our exposure index varied between 2 and 12, indicating low to high thermal exposures. Several high-temperature spots associated with a large volume of foot traffic are successfully identified through this DTEx. We observed the hottest spots at shopping plazas but not specifically in the urban center. During the selected football gameday, the exposure index surged across most places near the football stadium but was reduced considerably further away. Discussion: The proposed DTEx is novel because it provides dynamic heat monitoring capability to facilitate heat mitigation strategies at vulnerable locations in urban environments. Combining the mobility data and extensive sensor data generates rich details on the most heat-exposed areas due to human congregation. Such information will be critical for risk communication and urban planning for policymakers. DTEx could also help smart route planning in sustainable cities to avoid heat hazards risks. © 2021 The Authors",Ambient air temperature; Crowdsourcing; Foot traffic; Thermal comfort; Volunteered geographic information (VGI),"Yin Y., Grundstein A., Mishra D.R., Ramaswamy L., Hashemi Tonekaboni N., Dowd J.",10.1016/j.envint.2021.106573
64,2.0,2021,Article,Big data analytics for identifying electricity theft using machine learning approaches in microgrids for smart communities,"Electricity theft (ET) causes major revenue loss in power utilities. It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning,"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.",10.1002/cpe.6316
65,,2021,Article,Application of random forest and shap tree explainer in exploring spatial (In)justice to aid urban planning,"In light of recent local, national, and global events, spatial justice provides a potentially powerful lens by which to explore a multitude of spatial inequalities. For more than two decades, scholars have been espousing the power of this concept to help develop more equitable and just communities. However, defining spatial justice and developing a methodology for quantitatively an-alyzing it is complicated and no agreed upon metric for examining spatial justice has been developed. Instead, individual measures of spatial injustices have been studied. One such individual measure is economic mobility. Recent research on economic mobility has revealed the importance of local geography on upward mobility and may serve as an important keystone in developing a metric for multiple place-based issues of spatial inequality. This paper seeks to explore place-based variables within individual census tracts in an effort to understand their impact on economic mobility and potentially spatial justice. The methodology relies on machine learning techniques and the results show that the best performing model is able to predict economic mobility of a census tract based on its spatial variables with 86% accuracy. The availability and density of jobs, compactness of the area, and the presence of medical facilities and underground storage tanks have the greatest influence, whereas some of the influential features are positively while the others are negatively associated. In the end, this research will allow for comparative analysis between differing geographies and also identify leading variables in the overall quest for spatial justice. © 2021 by the authors.

Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction. © 2021",2000 MSC: 91D25; 91D10; Agent-based models; Crime prediction; Data-driven models; Location-based social services; Open data; Simulation; Urban data,"Rosés R., Kadar C., Malleson N.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101660
68,3.0,2021,Article,Geospatial simulation of urban neighbourhood densification potentials,"Although densification of urban areas is being proposed as a sustainable urbanisation strategy, frameworks for detailed large-scale analysis of densification potentials and their evaluation are lacking. A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4–15 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations. We show that in countries with a high number of post-war neighbourhoods in well-connected locations, considerable densification opportunities could be realised in already built-up residential areas. © 2021 The Author(s)",Archetype; Compact city; Machine learning; Redensification; Urban design; Urban structure unit,"Eggimann S., Wagner M., Ho Y.N., Züger M., Schneider U., Orehounig K.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103068
70,,2021,Article,Meta-regression framework for energy consumption prediction in a smart city: A case study of Songdo in South Korea,"Nowadays the concept of smart city has gained in popularity in urban studies. A smart city collects diverse information to monitor and analyze urban systems, such as energy management. It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Energy consumption; Ensemble meta regressor; Machine learning; Smart city; Topical information,"Carrera B., Peyrard S., Kim K.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103025
71,,2021,Article,"Evaluation of the environmental impacts of urbanization from the viewpoint of increased skin temperatures: a case study from Istanbul, Turkey","Urbanization is an inevitable process all around the world especially in developing countries like Turkey. Istanbul has been experiencing rapid urban expansion for the past 60 years. This urban expansion is leading to the replacement of forests by various artificial surfaces. This situation has a critical impact on the natural surfaces due to the alteration of heat energy balance. In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3 km2, and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260 km2. Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years. © 2021, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).",Istanbul; LST; Random Forest; Urban development; Urban heat island,"Khorrami B., Heidarlou H.B., Feizizadeh B.",10.1007/s12518-020-00350-3
75,,2021,Article,Ai augmented approach to identify shared ideas from large format public consultation,"Public data, contributed by citizens, stakeholders and other potentially affected parties, are becoming increasingly used to collect the shared ideas of a wider community. Having collected large quantities of text data from public consultation, the challenge is often how to interpret the dataset without resorting to lengthy time-consuming manual analysis. One approach gaining ground is the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Based on machine learning technology applied to analysis of human natural languages, NLP provides the opportunity to automate data analysis for large volumes of texts at a scale that would be virtually impossible to analyse manually. Using NLP toolkits, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying and visualising shared ideas from large format public consultation. The approach analyses grammatical structures of public texts to discover shared ideas from sentences comprising subject + verb + object and verb + object that express public options. In particular, the shared ideas are identified by extracting noun, verb, adjective phrases and clauses from subjects and objects, which are then categorised by urban infrastructure categories and terms. The results are visualised in a hierarchy chart and a word tree using cascade and tree views. The approach is illustrated using data collected from a public consultation exercise called “Share an Idea” undertaken in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the 2011 earthquake. The approach has the potential to upscale public participation to identify shared design values and associated qualities for a wide range of public initiatives including urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

76,11.0,2021,Review,IoT for smart cities: Machine learning approaches in smart healthcare—A review,"Smart city is a collective term for technologies and concepts that are directed toward making cities efficient, technologically more advanced, greener and more socially inclusive. These concepts include technical, economic and social innovations. This term has been tossed around by various actors in politics, business, administration and urban planning since the 2000s to establish tech-based changes and innovations in urban areas. The idea of the smart city is used in conjunction with the utilization of digital technologies and at the same time represents a reaction to the economic, social and political challenges that post-industrial societies are confronted with at the start of the new millennium. The key focus is on dealing with challenges faced by urban society, such as environ-mental pollution, demographic change, population growth, healthcare, the financial crisis or scarcity of resources. In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently. Throughout this paper, it will be discussed in detail how AI-powered IoT and WSNs are applied in the healthcare sector. This research will be a baseline study for understanding the role of the IoT in smart cities, in particular in the healthcare sector, for future research works. © 2021 by the authors.

79,,2021,Article,Assessing the cooling efficiency of urban parks using data envelopment analysis and remote sensing data,"Urban parks can contribute to significant cooling effect for the city microclimate and, therefore, promote urban residents’ outdoor thermal comfort. As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5 ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"Sun Y., Gao C., Li J., Gao M., Ma R.",10.1007/s00704-021-03665-2

Presently, many researchers employ the conservative machine learning based analysis but those are not appropriate for IoT based health data analysis because of their physical feature extraction and low accuracy. In this paper, we propose remote health monitoring and data analysis by integrating IoT and deep learning concepts. We proposed novel IoT based FoG assisted cloud network architecture that accumulates real-time health care data from patients via several medical IoT sensor networks, these data are analyzed using a deep learning algorithm deployed at Fog based Healthcare Platform. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is applied to the sustainable smart cities to evaluate the process for real-time. The proposed framework not only analyses the healthcare data but also provides immediate relief measures to the patient facing critical conditions and needs immediate consultancy of doctor.

81,5.0,2021,Article,"GIS-based comparative study of Bayes network, Hoeffding tree and logistic model tree for landslide susceptibility modeling","Landslides, one of the most common hazards around the world, have brought about severe damage to life and property of human. To prevent and mitigate landslides, various models have been introduced to assess landslide susceptibility. In this paper, Hoeffding Tree (HT), a prevailing data stream mining algorithm, was employed to predict landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China for the first time. Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances. Concretely, for training dataset, LMT model showed the highest AUC (0.854), followed by HT (0.726) and BN (0.709). However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China. Additionally, this study proved that HT model is a promising classifier for landslide susceptibility modeling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Frequency Ratio; Landslide susceptibility assessment; Machine learning; Muchuan County,"Chen W., Zhang S.",10.1016/j.catena.2021.105344

A variable drop-off loop function, based on the concept of early termination for reduction of model capacity, regularization, and generalization control, was tested. A susceptibility index for airborne particulate matter of less than 10 μm diameter (PM10) was modeled using monthly maximum values and spectral bands and indices from Landsat 8 imagery, and Open Street Maps were used to prepare a range of independent variables. Probability and classification index maps were prepared using extreme-gradient boosting (XGBOOST) and random forest (RF) algorithms. These were assessed against utility criteria such as a confusion matrix of overall accuracy, quantity of variables, processing delay, degree of overfitting, importance distribution, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).

91,,2021,Article,Sustainable development scale of housing estates: An economic assessment using machine learning approach,"Economic sustainability is often addressed from the perspective of economic growth and at the national level. In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",density; housing; machine learning; threshold; urban planning,"Tang B.-S., Ho W.K.O., Wong S.W.",10.1002/sd.2168
94,2.0,2021,Article,Designing roadside green infrastructure to mitigate traffic-related air pollution using machine learning,"Communities located in near-road environments are exposed to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), causing adverse health effects. While roadside vegetation barriers can help mitigate TRAP, their effectiveness to reduce TRAP is influenced by site-specific conditions. To test vegetation designs using direct field measurements or high-fidelity numerical simulations is often infeasible since urban planners and local communities often lack the access and expertise to use those tools. There is a need for a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use method to evaluate vegetation barrier designs based on their capacity to mitigate TRAP. In this paper, we investigated five machine learning (ML) methods, including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and neural networks (NN), to predict size-resolved and locationally dependent particle concentrations downwind of various vegetation barrier designs. Data from 83 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations was used to train and test the ML models. We developed downwind region-specific models to capture the complexity of this problem and enhance the overall accuracy. Our feature space was composed of variables that can be feasibly obtained such as vegetation width, height, leaf area index (LAI), particle size, leaf area density (LAD) and wind speed at different heights. RF, NN, and XGB performed well with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 6–7% and an average test R2 value &gt;0.91, while SVM and LR had an NRMSE of approximately 13% and an average test R2 value of 0.56. Using feature selection, vegetation dimensions and particle size had the highest influence in predicting pollutant concentrations. The ML models developed can help create tools to aid local communities in developing mitigation strategies to address TRAP problems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Air quality; Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Particulate matter (PM); Urban designs; Vegetation,"Hashad K., Gu J., Yang B., Rong M., Chen E., Ma X., Zhang K.M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144760
95,1.0,2021,Article,Urban morphological feature extraction and multi-dimensional similarity analysis based on deep learning approaches,"The study of urban morphology contributes to the evolution of cities and sustainable development. Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots’ figure–ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences.

99,1.0,2021,Article,Identifying urban poverty using high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning approaches: Implications for housing inequality,"Enriching Asian perspectives on the rapid identification of urban poverty and its implications for housing inequality, this paper contributes empirical evidence about the utility of image features derived from high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning approaches for identifying urban poverty in China at the community level. For the case of the Jiangxia District and Huangpi District of Wuhan, image features, including perimeter, line segment detector (LSD), Hough transform, gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), histogram of oriented gradients (HoG), and local binary patterns (LBP), are calculated, and four machine learning approaches and 25 variables are applied to identify urban poverty and relatively important variables. The results show that image features and machine learning approaches can be used to identify urban poverty with the best model performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.5341 and 0.5324 for Jiangxia and Huangpi, respectively, although some differences exist among the approaches and study areas. The importance of each variable differs for each approach and study area; however, the relatively important variables are similar. In particular, four variables achieved relatively satisfactory prediction results for all models and presented obvious differences in varying communities with different poverty levels. Housing inequality within low-income neighborhoods, which is a response to gaps in wealth, income, and housing affordability among social groups, is an important manifestation of urban poverty. Policy makers can implement these findings to rapidly identify urban poverty, and the findings have potential applications for addressing housing inequality and proving the rationality of urban planning for building a sustainable society. © 2021 by the authors.

101,10.0,2021,Article,An ensemble energy consumption forecasting model based on spatial-temporal clustering analysis in residential buildings,"Due to the availability of smart metering infrastructure, high-resolution electric consumption data is readily available to study the dynamics of residential electric consumption at finely resolved spatial and temporal scales. Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer’s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

At an urban level, this study collected various sources of data and proposed a machine learning method (Back Propagation Neural Network - BPNN) to predict different functions of UBCE by BEF in Changxing, a representative small city in China. The study found that UBCE can be significantly affected by BEF such as density, function, and morphology. The BPNN has a good prediction performance on different functions of UBCE, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is stable within 10 %–20 %. The prediction results showed that the average value of different functions of UBCE presented an obvious variation. The carbon emission map showed that the high UBCE are mainly clustered in the middle-east and south of the central city of Changxing. By comparison with other studies, the accuracy of this method was proved. This method could be applied to predict carbon emissions of the urban planning scheme. Optimizing the BEF of urban blocks can play key roles in the reduction of carbon emissions and then alleviation of the UHI. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment factors; Low-carbon city; Machine learning; Prediction; Urban blocks carbon emissions,"Zhang X., Yan F., Liu H., Qiao Z.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.102875
103,1.0,2021,Article,Learning with self-attention for rental market spatial dynamics in the Atlanta metropolitan area,"The rental housing market plays a critical role in the United States real estate market. Prior studies have used various approaches to model housing rent, such as interpolation, hedonic modeling, and machine learning. However, only a few studies have modeled rental prices based on textual data, which provides rich and contextual information about rental properties. In addition, many models, especially deep learning models, use an end-to-end black box for prediction, which hides the decision process. Such models are difficult to interpret and explain the driving factors. This study builds on our previous work, aiming to develop and evaluate rental market spatial dynamics models combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and self-attention mechanism. We compare the performance of the proposed model with our previous models on predicting rental prices in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

105,2.0,2021,Article,"Predictive models using “cheap and easy” field measurements: Can they fill a gap in planning, monitoring, and implementing fecal sludge management solutions?","The characteristics of fecal sludge delivered to treatment plants are highly variable. Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. © 2021 The Authors",fecal sludge; image analysis; machine learning; Random forest; sanitation; WASH,"Ward B.J., Andriessen N., Tembo J.M., Kabika J., Grau M., Scheidegger A., Morgenroth E., Strande L.",10.1016/j.watres.2021.116997
107,,2021,Article,Local and application-specific geodemographics for data-led urban decision making,"This work seeks to introduce improvements to the traditional variable selection procedures employed in the development of geodemographic classifications. It presents a proposal for shifting from a traditional approach for generating general-purpose one-size-fits-all geodemographic classifications to application-specific classifications. This proposal addresses the recent scepticism towards the utility of general-purpose applications by employing supervised machine learning techniques in order to identify contextually relevant input variables from which to develop geodemographic classifications with increased discriminatory power. A framework introducing such techniques in the variable selection phase of geodemographic classification development is presented via a practical use-case that is focused on generating a geodemographic classification with an increased capacity for discriminating the propensity for Library use in the UK city of Leeds. Two local classifications are generated for the city, one a general-purpose classification, and the other, an application-specific classification incorporating supervised Feature Selection methods in the selection of input variables. The discriminatory power of each classification is evaluated and compared, with the result successfully demonstrating the capacity for the application-specific approach to generate a more contextually relevant result, and thus underpins increasingly targeted public policy decision making, particularly in the context of urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

108,1.0,2021,Article,Investigation of urban climates and built environment relations by using machine learning,"Climate change can cause a cascade of effects from the individual organisms to ecosystem-scale where in nature, all species are elements of complex networks of interactions. Hence, every impact on every scale has a significant role. Those properties of the networks are decisive on the global ecosystem, so how they will be modified by climate change needs serious studies. The vast population of the urban areas exerts significant effects on climate change even though they cover a small proportion of the surface of the Earth; however, impacts of urbanization on climate and ecosystems remain inadequately understood. In the meantime, urbanization continues to increase and in 2030, two-thirds of the population is expected to be living in urban areas with an increasing rate in time. It is of great importance to elaborate on the relations between urbanization and climate. In this respect, the use of information technologies with an extensive computational capacity is one of the cornerstones of climate and urban studies. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the automated recognition of patterns from data. The use of machine learning algorithms can bring significant advantages to both understandings and predicting the climate. The computational power with big data, their ability to capture nonlinear behavior, and learn as new data arrive make machine learning a useful tool for understanding climate and developing urban planning. In this sense, the purpose of this study is to show the advantages of machine learning algorithm by developing a recurrent neural network algorithm to make climate predictions and stating possible effects of machine learning on design and its contribution to understanding the climate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Architecture; Climate; Climate change; Machine learning; Urban design,"Koc M., Acar A.",10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100820
109,1.0,2021,Article,A machine learning approach to the simulation of intercity corporate networks in mainland China,"This paper explores the potential of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the simulation of intercity networks. To this end, we implement the random forest MLA to simulate the intercity corporate networks created by Fortune China 500 firms in mainland China. The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940. Nonetheless, the random forest MLA also faces some challenges in the context of the simulation of intercity networks. We conclude that MLAs are potentially useful for specific applications such as the analysis of network big data, scenario simulation in regional planning, and the detection of driving forces in exploratory research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Intercity network; Machine learning; Modelling; Random forest; Simulation; Urban system,"Li L., Derudder B., Kong X.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101598
111,10.0,2021,Article,Improving GPS Code Phase Positioning Accuracy in Urban Environments Using Machine Learning,"The accuracy of location information, mainly provided by the global positioning system (GPS) sensor, is critical for Internet-of-Things applications in smart cities. However, built environments attenuate GPS signals by reflecting or blocking them resulting in some cases multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These effects cause range errors that degrade GPS positioning accuracy. Enhancements in the design of antennae and receivers deliver a level of reduction of multipath. However, NLOS signal reception and residual effects of multipath are still to be mitigated sufficiently for improvements in range errors and positioning accuracy. Recent machine learning-based methods have shown promise in improving pseudorange-based position solutions by considering multiple variables from raw GPS measurements. However, positioning accuracy is limited by low accuracy signal reception classification. Unlike the existing methods, which use machine learning to directly predict the signal reception classification, we use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based method to predict the pseudorange errors by considering the signal strength, satellite elevation angle and pseudorange residuals. With the predicted pseudorange errors, two variations of the algorithm are proposed to improve positioning accuracy. The first corrects pseudorange errors and the other either corrects or excludes the signals determined to contain the effects of multipath and NLOS signals. The results for a challenging urban environment characterized by high-rise buildings on one side, show that the 3-D positioning accuracy of the pseudorange error correction-based positioning measured in terms of the root mean square error is 23.3 m, an improvement of more than 70% over the conventional methods. © 2014 IEEE.",Global positioning system (GPS); gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); multipath; non-line-of-sight (NLOS); urban positioning,"Sun R., Wang G., Cheng Q., Fu L., Chiang K.-W., Hsu L.-T., Ochieng W.Y.",10.1109/JIOT.2020.3037074

Urban rainstorms and waterlogging have become an urgent challenge that needs to be monitored in real time and further predicted for the improvement of urbanization construction. We trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging. The RNN model has been thoroughly evaluated, and our experimental results showed that it achieved higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT).

115,2.0,2021,Article,Proposing an effective and inexpensive tool to detect urban surface temperature changes associated with urbanization processes in small cities,"A consequence of urbanization is the loss of vegetation cover, replaced by urban areas. This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Change detection index; LST; NDBI; NDVI; Urban heat island; Urban planning,"Silva A.G.L., Torres M.C.A.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.107634

The awareness is growing that the urban development potential (‘magnetism’) of cities is closely related to safety and security conditions in these cities. This paper develops a new analytical framework based on a wealth of empirical data on both safety/security and socio-economic magnetism achievements of many world cities, by combining two comprehensive relevant global urban data bases. The aim of the study is to offer a comparative analysis of the combined safety/security data and socio-economic performance data of 30 global cities, through the use of an advanced sequential cluster dynamics analysis that is (partly) inspired by a novel machine learning approach (using Python software). In this way, cities can be categorized according to their quantitative characteristic features represented by the relevant clusters. It appears that city safety/security features are an important predictor of the variability in overall urban performance regarding magnetism.

123,7.0,2021,Article,Disentangling the comparative roles of multilevel built environment on body mass index: Evidence from China,"One common goal of urban planning is to promote health, where the built environment (BE) is believed to play an essential role. This study provides new evidence for the links between body mass index (BMI) and the BE at different geographic scales in a unified framework. Based on a sample of 10,962 individuals across 95 cities in China, this study explores the collective effects of the BE attributes at neighborhood and city levels on BMI using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach. Moreover, whether the relationships between the city-level BE attributes and BMI vary across social groups is revealed. The results indicate that the city-level BE attributes have larger collective effects on BMI than the neighborhood-level BE attributes. Specifically, population size is the greatest contributor to predicting BMI, with a relative importance of 13.92% among all influential factors. Moreover, it is found that the effects of city-level BE attributes vary across different social groups. These findings suggest it is of vital importance for urban planners to coordinate both neighborhood- and city-level BE planning to deter the risks of obesity, and urban planning can be more effective if it is implemented considering local socio-demographic characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Different geographic scales; Interactive effects; Machine learning method; Obesity; Relative importance,"Wang X., Shao C., Yin C., Guan L.",10.1016/j.cities.2020.103048

With an increasingly large number of studies on urban place detection in language, behavior, pricing, and demography, recent critiques of longstanding regional science perspectives on place detection have focused on the arbitrariness and non-geographical nature of measures of best fit. In this paper, we develop new explicitly geographical measures of cluster fit. These hybrid spatial–social measures, called geosilhouettes, are demonstrated to capture the “core” of geographical clusters in racial data on census blocks in Brooklyn neighborhoods. These new geosilhouettes are also useful in a variety of boundary analysis and outlier detection problems. In this paper, the thinking behind geosilhouettes is presented, their mathematical form is defined, they are demonstrated, and new directions of research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.",clustering; Data science; segregation; unsupervised learning; urban sociology,"Wolf L.J., Knaap E., Rey S.",10.1177/2399808319875752
131,11.0,2021,Article,"Rainfall-induced shallow landslide detachment, transit and runout susceptibility mapping by integrating machine learning techniques and gis-based approaches","Rainfall-induced shallow landslides represent a serious threat in hilly and mountain areas around the world. The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the “reach angle” method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. © 2021 by the authors.

132,1.0,2021,Article,4D building reconstruction with machine learning and historical maps,"The increasing importance of three-dimensional (3D) city modelling is linked to these data’s different applications and advantages in many domains. Images and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data availability are now an evident and unavoidable prerequisite, not always verified for past scenarios. Indeed, historical maps are often the only source of information when dealing with historical scenarios or multi-temporal (4D) digital representations. The paper presents a methodology to derive 4D building models in the level of detail 1 (LoD1), inferring missing height information through machine learning techniques. The aim is to realise 4D LoD1 buildings for geospatial analyses and visualisation, valorising historical data, and urban studies. Several machine learning regression techniques are analysed and employed for deriving missing height data from digitised multi-temporal maps. The implemented method relies on geometric, neighbours, and categorical attributes for height prediction. Derived elevation data are then used for 4D building reconstructions, offering multitemporal versions of the considered urban scenarios. Various evaluation metrics are also presented for tackling the common issue of lack of ground-truth information within historical data. © 2021 by the authors.

136,2.0,2021,Article,Delineation of an Urban Community Life Circle Based on a Machine-Learning Estimation of Spatiotemporal Behavioral Demand,"Delineating life circles is an essential prerequisite for urban community life circle planning. Recent studies combined the environmental contexts with residents’ global positioning system (GPS) data to delineate the life circles. This method, however, is constrained by GPS data, and it can only be applied in the GPS surveyed communities. To address this limitation, this study developed a generalizable delineation method without the constraint of behavioral data. According to previous research, the community life circle consists of the walking-accessible range and internal structure. The core task to develop the generalizable method was to estimate the spatiotemporal behavioral demand for each plot of land to acquire the internal structure of the life circle, as the range can be delineated primarily based on environmental data. Therefore, behavioral demand estimation models were established through logistic regression and machine learning techniques, including decision trees and ensemble learning. The model with the lowest error rate was chosen as the final estimation model for each type of land. Finally, we used a community without GPS data as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimation models and delineation method. This article extends the existing literature by introducing spatiotemporal behavioral demand estimation models, which learn the relationships between environmental contexts, population composition and the existing delineated results based on GPS data to delineate the internal structure of the community life circle without employing behavioral data. Furthermore, the proposed method and delineation results also contributes to facilities adjustments and location selections in life circle planning, people-oriented transformation in urban planning, and activity space estimation of the population in evaluating and improving the urban policies. © 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",community life circle; decision tree; demand estimation model; ensemble learning; spatiotemporal behavioral demand,"Li C., Xia W., Chai Y.",10.1007/s11769-021-1174-z
140,,2021,Article,A glimpse into the future of exposure and vulnerabilities in cities? Modelling of residential location choice of urban population with random forest,"The most common approach to assessing natural hazard risk is investigating the willingness to pay in the presence or absence of such risk. In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus. Avenues for future research include the operational strengthening of these linkages for more effective disaster risk management. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

This paper selects the pollutant data and meteorological data of Hangzhou from 2016 to 2020 to analyze the influence of seasonal factors, pollutant factors and meteorological factors on PM2.5 concentration in Hangzhou. The results show that the concentration of PM2.5 varies significantly in different seasons, so this paper adopts the method of seasonal prediction.

To accommodate urban planning for these changes, cities, and communities need to know how many (micromobility) vehicles are on the road. In this work, we design a concept for a compact, mobile, and energy-efficient system to classify and count micromobility vehicles. We aim for a battery-powered system, which can be installed in a short time by a single person and is non-invasive for the ground or traffic. For this purpose, we investigate a system architecture consisting of uncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging sensors and a neuromorphic co-processor. This processor can perform classifications in a fixed time of 16,2μs without requiring additional hardware for learning. It can adapt its knowledge base to new environments without external updates. Our system is aimed to achieve adequate accuracy only using a low-resolution sensor and moderate processing power. We will show that an object representation of only 256 Bytes is sufficient to achieve a four-class classification accuracy higher than 80%, with an overall power consumption of less than 7mW.

149,1.0,2021,Article,Autonomous 3-D UAV Localization Using Cellular Networks: Deep Supervised Learning Versus Reinforcement Learning Approaches,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an integral part of numerous commercial and military applications. In many of these applications, the UAV is required to self-navigate in highly dynamic urban environments. This means that the UAV must have the ability to determine its location in an autonomous and real time manner. Existing localization techniques rely mainly on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and do not provide a reliable real time localization solution, particularly in dense urban environments. Our objective is to propose an effective alternative solution to enable the UAV to autonomously determine its location independent of the GPS and without message exchanges. We therefore propose utilizing the existing 5G cellular infrastructure to enable the UAV to determine its 3-D location without the need to interact with the cellular network. We formulate the UAV localization problem to minimize the error of the RSSI measurements from the surrounding cellular base stations. While exact optimization techniques can be applied to accurately solve such a problem, they cannot provide the real time calculation that is needed in such dynamic applications. Machine learning based techniques are strong candidates to provide an attractive alternative to provide a near-optimal localization solution with the needed practical real-time calculation. Accordingly, we propose two machine learning-based approaches, namely, deep neural network and reinforcement learning based approaches, to solve the formulated UAV localization problem in real time. We then provide a detailed comparative analysis for each of the proposed localization techniques along with a comparison with the optimization-based techniques as well as other techniques from the literature. © 2013 IEEE.",5G; deep learning; neural networks; optimization; Q-learning; reinforcement learning; UAV 3-D autonomous localization,"Afifi G., Gadallah Y.",10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126775

159,1.0,2021,Article,Predicting susceptibility to landslides under climate change impacts in metropolitan areas of South Korea using machine learning,"Landslides cause considerable damage to life and property worldwide. In order to prevent and respond to landslides, it is necessary to identify vulnerable areas. This study identified areas that are likely to be damaged by landslides and aimed to predict future landslides. We compared and analyzed areas using machine learning (ML) algorithms, and conducted susceptibility mapping and landslide prediction using an algorithm that produced excellent results. For landslide predictions, the probability distribution of precipitation in the representative concentration pathway scenario 8.5 was used. We accounted for future uncertainties by using several regional climate model scenarios. Comparing the performances of different ML algorithms, the overall prediction accuracy of the random forest (0.932) was excellent. Susceptibility to landslides in the future determined using the random forest and five other regional climate models exhibited minor differences, but the average susceptibility increased over time. In addition, many urban areas are distributed around forest areas that have high landslide vulnerabilities, which provide important perspectives for urban and environmental planning. © 2021 The Author(s).

160,,2021,Review,"Reviewing the application of machine learning methods to model urban form indicators in planning decision support systems: Potential, issues and challenges","Modern cities dynamically face several challenges including digitalization, sustainability, resilience and economic development. Urban planners and designers must develop urban forms that address these challenges. With the integration of new communication and information technologies (Smartphone, GIS, Drones, IoT, Sensors, etc.), urban activities have generated large volumes of urban data. The rapid growth in terms of collection and big data storage capacities combined with the ever-increasing computational power of modern machines have made possible their efficient treatment using machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The emergence of such groundbreaking methods has in turn helped to address the challenges of modern-day cities in several domains (health, security, mobility, etc). ML algorithms have been proposed to model the urban form's indicators for intelligent urban planning decision making. They have been proven to perform better than the traditional methods. However, the potential of ML has not yet been fully explored in research for urban planning decision support. This paper presents a comprehensive review of ML applications for mitigating the challenges of modern cities planning. First and foremost, an overview of the urban forms, sources of urban data, the ML and DL techniques as well as their potential in solving the aforementioned challenges. For each ML method, we will highlight it working principle, advantages, disadvantages and potential applications using comparative tables. Finally, we will discuss the issues and challenges of ML methods in urban form's modeling while ultimately advocating some future research directions. © 2021",Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Ensemble methods; Machine learning; Neural networks; Urban big data; Urban data; Urban form; Urban models; Urban planning,"Koumetio Tekouabou S.C., Diop E.B., Azmi R., Jaligot R., Chenal J.",10.1016/j.jksuci.2021.08.007

Effectively using urban data to solve city development and planning issues has become a research hot-spot. Currently, the data scale in modern cities is quite different, and the fitting degree of machine learning algorithm based on single city is not mature yet. This paper studies the problem with transfer learning technique, and trains the prediction model of urban hotel development scale using multi-source city data.

164,,2021,Article,Machine Learning Predictors for Sustainable Urban Planning,"While essential for economic reasons, rapid urbanization has had many negative impacts on the environment and the social wellbeing of humanity. Heavy traffic, unexpected geohazards are some of the effects of uncontrollable development. This situation points its fingerto urban planning and design; there are numerous automation tools to help urban planners assess and forecast, yet unplanned development still occurs, impeding sustainability. Automation tools use machine learning classification models to analyze spatial data and various trend views before planning a new urban development. Although there are many sophisticated tools and massive datasets, big cities with colossal migration still witness traffic jams, pollution, and environmental degradation affecting urban dwellers’ quality. This study will analyze the current predictors in urban planning machine learning models and identify the suitable predictors to support sustainable urban planning. A correct set of predictors could improve the efficiency of the urban development classification models and help urban planners to enhance the quality of life in big cities. © 2021.

166,,2021,Book Chapter,Planning Support Systems for Long-Term Climate Resilience: A Critical Review,"As climate change is becoming a reality, there is an increasing demand to improve urban resilience. Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience,"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.",10.1007/978-3-030-76059-5_24
168,,2021,Conference Paper,An Intelligent Tree Planning Approach Using Location-Based Social Networks Data,"How do we make sure that all citizens in a city have access to enough green space? An increasing part of the world’s population lives in urban areas, where contact with nature is largely reduced to street trees and parks. As optional tree planting sites and financial resources are limited, determining the best planting site can be formulated as an optimization problem with constraints. Can we locate these sites based on the popularity of nearby venues? How can we ensure that we include groups of people who tend to spend time in tree deprived areas? Currently, tree location sites are chosen based on criteria from spatial-visual, physical and biological, and functional categories. As these criteria do not give any insights into which citizens are benefiting from the tree placement, we propose new data-driven tree planting policies that take socio-cultural aspects as represented by the citizens’ behavior into account. We combine a Location Based Social Network (LBSN) mobility data set with tree location data sets, both of New York City and Paris, as a case study. The effect of four different policies is evaluated on simulated movement data and assessed on the average, overall exposure to trees as well as on how much inequality in tree exposure is mitigated. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Community detection algorithms; Mobility data; Multi-objective optimization; Social network analysis; Tree planning; Urban computing,"van Staalduinen J.H., Tetteroo J., Gawehns D., Baratchi M.",10.1007/978-3-030-76640-5_10

Land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) have facilitated a wide spectrum of applications and further triggered new opportunities in urban studies. New and improved Earth observations, algorithms, and advanced products for extracting thematic urban information, in association with emerging social sensing big data and auxiliary crowdsourcing datasets, all together offer great potentials to mapping fine-resolution EULUC from regional to global scales. Here we review the advances of EULUC mapping research and practices in terms of their data, methods, and applications. Based on the historical retrospect, we summarize the challenges and limitations of current EULUC studies regarding sample collection, mixed land use problem, data and model generalization, and large-scale mapping efforts. Finally, we propose and discuss future opportunities, including cross-scale mapping, optimal integration of multi-source features, global sample libraries from crowdsourcing approaches, advanced machine learning and ensembled classification strategy, open portals for data visualization and sharing, multi-temporal mapping of EULUC change, and implications in urban environmental studies, to facilitate multi-scale fine-resolution EULUC mapping research. © 2021 The Author(s).

174,1.0,2021,Conference Paper,EquiTensors: Learning Fair Integrations of Heterogeneous Urban Data,"Neural methods are state-of-the-art for urban prediction problems such as transportation resource demand, accident risk, crowd mobility, and public safety. Model performance can be improved by integrating exogenous features from open data repositories (e.g., weather, housing prices, traffic, etc.), but these uncurated sources are often too noisy, incomplete, and biased to use directly. We propose to learn integrated representations, called EquiTensors, from heterogeneous datasets that can be reused across a variety of tasks. We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with ""oracle""models that use hand-selected datasets. © 2021 ACM.",data integration; fairness in machine learning; neural networks; open data; spatial-temporal predictions,"Yan A., Howe B.",10.1145/3448016.3452777
176,2.0,2021,Article,Development of a novel hybrid multi-boosting neural network model for spatial prediction of urban flood,"In this study, a new hybridized machine learning algorithm for urban flood susceptibility mapping, named MultiB-MLPNN, was developed using a multi-boosting technique and MLPNN. The model was tested in Amol City, Iran, a data-scarce city in an ungauged area which is prone to severe flood inundation events and currently lacks flood prevention infrastructure. Performance of the hybridized model was compared with that of a standalone MLPNN model, random forest and boosted regression trees. Area under the curve, efficiency, true skill statistic, Matthews correlation coefficient, misclassification rate, sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate model performance. In validation, the MultiB-MLPNN model showed the best predictive performance. The hybridized MultiB-MLPNN model is thus useful for generating realistic flood susceptibility maps for data-scarce urban areas. The maps can be used to develop risk-reduction measures to protect urban areas from devastating floods, particularly where available data are insufficient to support physically based hydrological or hydraulic models. © 2021 The Author(s).

178,,2021,Article,Estimating the influence of building and urban form on the thermal loads of urban dwellings in the Mediterranean climate using machine learning,"The paper presents a novel method of generating metamodels that can quantify the influence of urban form on the heating and cooling loads of dwellings for the Mediterranean climate. The goal of the metamodels is to inform the early urban design process with quick and accurate feedback on the energy demand of a given urban configuration. The proposed method generates training datasets through Monte Carlo dynamic energy simulations of a single thermal zone. The study focuses on the geometrical parameters that affect building energy balance at the urban scale, such as dwelling shape, compactness, adjacencies and shading, utilizing a set of morphological indicators to relate these parameters to heating and cooling loads. The study focuses on the Mediterranean climate of Thessaloniki, Greece and utilizes several open-source tools (Ladybug Tools, EnergyPlus and Scikit-learn) under a streamlined workflow. The metamodels, which are trained using the Random Forest algorithm are then validated on 12 real-world urban sites of Thessaloniki with a reported Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) of 12% and 15% for heating and cooling loads, respectively. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",cooling loads; energy plus; Heating loads; machine learning; metamodeling; residential; urban form,"Vartholomaios A., Chatzidimitriou A., Ioannidis K.",10.1080/15567249.2021.1916796
179,,2021,Conference Paper,Measuring sustainability and urban data operationalization: An integrated computational framework to evaluate and interpret the performance of the urban form,"With rapid urbanization, the necessity for sustainable development has skyrocketed, and sustainable urban development is a must. Recent advances in computing performance of urban layouts in real-time allow for new paradigms of performance-driven design. As beneficial as utilizing multiple layers of urban data may be, it can also create a challenge in interpreting and operationalizing data. This paper presents an integrated computational framework to measure sustainability, operationalize and interpret the urban form's performance data using generative design methods, novel performance simulations, and machine learning predictions. The performance data is clustered into three pillars of sustainability: social, environmental, and economical, and it is followed with the performance space exploration, which assists in extracting knowledge and actionable rules of thumb. A significant advantage of the framework is that it can be used as a discussion table in participatory planning processes since it could be easily adapted to interactive environments. © 2021 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Data interpretation; Generative design; Machine learning; Performance simulation; Urban sustainability,"Elshani D., Koenig R., Duering S., Schneider S., Chronis A.",

With the development of polarized SAR in the direction of high resolution, a single feature often cannot fully express the detailed information of ground objects, resulting in poor classification results and low accuracy. The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score.

181,,2021,Book Chapter,Modeling Urban Futures: Data-Driven Scenarios of Climate Change and Vulnerability in Cities,"Cities are complex systems where social, ecological, and technological processes are deeply coupled. This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata model uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical flood hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations. Our work shows that coproduced scenarios, when grounded with historical and emerging data, can provide paths that increase resilience to weather hazards as well as enhancing ecosystem services provided to citizens. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",Climate vulnerability; Hazard; Land use/cover change modeling; Mapping; Urban development scenarios,"Ortiz L., Mustafa A., Rosenzweig B., McPhearson T.",10.1007/978-3-030-63131-4_9

We construct a ResNet-50-based social detection model to explore the potential relationship between street view images and job-housing attributes. The method extracts street view images of a neighborhood in all eight directions to predict land parcels’ job-housing attributes and uses an entropy index to measure the degree of job-housing mixture in Shenzhen as an example. The social-detection model performs well with a low RMSE (0.1094) in identifying job-housing patterns. The eight-direction neighborhood method shows the best support for sufficient neighborhood information from street view images (RMSE = 0.1135) compared with other neighborhood methods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using street-view images and deep learning to characterize job-housing attributes consistent with findings from urban studies with socioeconomic data; for example, the research finding concurs that Shenzhen has many high job-housing mixtures with very few areas designated for jobs or residences. The proposed method, when applied regularly, can help monitor spatial dynamics of urban job-housing patterns to inform city planning and development. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deep learning; job-housing; socioeconomic characteristics; street view images; Urban spatial structure,"Yao Y., Zhang J., Qian C., Wang Y., Ren S., Yuan Z., Guan Q.",10.1080/13658816.2021.1895170

Under the backdrop of global urbanization, some cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters that are influenced by unplanned urban expansion. Rational planning of urban functional areas needs to be strengthened to improve the scientific approach of urban planning and urbanization. In this study, the classification of urban functional areas based on dual-modal data (i.e., remote sensing image and user behavior data) was implemented using machine learning (ML) algorithms. After the set test, the classification accuracy of urban functional areas reached 82.45%. Through analysis, it could be concluded that the use of data of two modalities achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by using data of a single modality.

195,7.0,2021,Article,Estimating quality of life dimensions from urban spatial pattern metrics,"The spatial structure of urban areas plays a major role in the daily life of dwellers. The current policy framework to ensure the quality of life of inhabitants leaving no one behind, leads decision-makers to seek better-informed choices for the sustainable planning of urban areas. Thus, a better understanding between the spatial structure of cities and their socio-economic level is of crucial relevance. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to quantify this two-way relationship. Therefore, we measured spatial patterns of 31 cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We rely on spatial pattern metrics derived from a Local Climate Zone classification obtained by fusing remote sensing and open GIS data with a machine learning approach. Based upon the data, we quantified the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and socio-economic variables related to ‘education’, ‘health’, ‘living conditions’, ‘labor’, and ‘transport’ by means of multiple linear regression models, explaining the variability of the socio-economic variables from 43% up to 82%. Additionally, we grouped cities according to their level of ‘quality of life’ using the socio-economic variables, and found that the spatial pattern of low-dense built-up types was different among socio-economic groups. The proposed methodology described in this paper is transferable to other datasets, levels, and regions. This is of great potential, due to the growing availability of open statistical and satellite data and derived products.

Most cities and urban regions all over the world compete to increase resident and visitor satisfaction. The growing requirements and rapidity of introducing new technologies to all aspects of residents’ lives force cities and urban regions to implement “smart cities” concepts in their activities. Real estate is one of the principal anthropogenic components of urban environment thus become a subject of thorough multidisciplinary analysis in the field of data requiring spatial information systems. Recent advances in information technology, combined with the increased availability of high-resolution imagery from Earth observation, create an opportunity to use new sources of data that enable to identify, monitor, and solved many of urban environmental problem. The aim of the paper is to elaborate precise, complete and detailed property information with the use of remote sensing observations in a suitable numerical algorithm. The authors concentrate on providing one of the most important, and probably the most lacking, feature describing properties – building usable floor area (BUFA). The solution is elaborated in the form of an automatic algorithm based on machine learning and computer vision technology related to LiDAR (big data), close range images with respect to spatial information systems requirements.

We used a machine learning-based workflow to predict high resolution (30 m) and sub-daily atmospheric variables fields of near-surface air temperature and humidity, and wind speed. The method used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition applied on ground stations observations or Global Climate Model (GCM) residual error, in a sequence with bias correction and statistical models (Linear Regression-LR, Artificial Neural Network model-ANN and Empirical Quantile Mapping-EQM) to provide downscaling from large scale atmospheric conditions to complex terrain variability. The predictions described relationships of Principal Component (PC) scores dependent on GCM temporal variability on 6-hourly basis (with LR or ANN or EQM), and PC loadings dependent on topographic indexes to help providing horizontal sub-grid extrapolation. The methods were validated with a 1-year dataset from a dense weather stations network deployed in a complex terrain basin in tropical climate of Southeast Brazil. We present an exhaustive description of the PC modes daily/seasonal variability for each variable, and their spatial variability associated to the topography and thermal driven circulations. The predictions in general substantially improved accuracy when compared to GCM outputs, especially near the valley and in sheltered area where local effects are mandatories.

199,17.0,2020,Review,The conceptual basis of water-energy-food nexus governance: systematic literature review using network and discourse analysis,"In the last decade, the debate on the governance of water, energy, and food (WEF) has intensified, spurring the emergence of the term “nexus governance.” In general, the reduction of trade-offs and construction of synergies between WEF have been placed on the scientific, political, and economic agenda. However, although increasingly used, it is difficult to find a clear meaning and definition of what the term represents. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), using text-mining and machine learning algorithms, this article investigates what are the conceptual basis of the nexus governance debate, and attempts to clarify the main themes, networks, and gaps within this literature. The analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative methods, combining social network analysis (SNA) and discourse analysis (DA).

201,8.0,2020,Article,Thermal comfort prediction by applying supervised machine learning in green sidewalks of Tehran,"Purpose: This research aims to introduce a new methodology for integration between urban design strategies and supervised machine learning (SML) method – by applying both energy engineering modeling (evaluating phase) for the existing green sidewalks and statistical energy modeling (predicting phase) for the new ones – to offer algorithms that help to catch the optimum morphology of green sidewalks, in case of high quality of the outdoor thermal comfort and less errors in results. Design/methodology/approach: The tools of the study are the way of processing by SML, predicting the future based on the past. Machine learning is benefited from Python advantages. The structure of the study consisted of two main parts, as the majority of the similar studies follow: engineering energy modeling and statistical energy modeling. According to the concept of the study, at first, from 2268 models, some are randomly selected, simulated and sensitively analyzed by ENVI-met. Furthermore, the Envi-met output as the quantity of thermal comfort – predicted mean vote (PMV) and weather items are inputs of Python. Then, the formed data set is processed by SML, to reach the final reliable predicted output. Findings: The process of SML leads the study to find thermal comfort of current models and other similar sidewalks. The results are evaluated by both PMV mathematical model and SML error evaluation functions. The results confirm that the average of the occurred error is about 1%. Then the method of study is reliable to apply in the variety of similar fields. Finding of this study can be helpful in perspective of the sustainable architecture strategies in the buildings and urban scales, to determine, monitor and control energy-based behaviors (thermal comfort, heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation) in operational phase of the systems (existed elements in buildings, and constructions) and the planning and designing phase of the future built cases – all over their life spans. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are related to the study variables and alternatives that are notable impact on the findings. Furthermore, the most trustable input data will result in the more accuracy in output. Then modeling and simulation processes are most significant part of the research to reach the exact results in the final step. Practical implications: Finding of the study can be helpful in urban design strategies. By finding outdoor thermal comfort that resulted from machine learning method, urban and landscape designers, policymakers and architects are able to estimate the features of their designs in air quality and urban health and can be sure in catching design goals in case of thermal comfort in urban atmosphere. Social implications: By 2030, cities are delved as living spaces for about three out of five people. As green infrastructures influence in moderating the cities’ climate, the relationship between green spaces and habitants’ thermal comfort is deduced. Although the strategies to outside thermal comfort improvement, by design methods and applicants, are not new subject to discuss, applying machines that may be common in predicting results can be called as a new insight in applying more effective design strategies and in urban environment’s comfort preparation. Then study’s footprint in social implications stems in learning from the previous projects and developing more efficient strategies to prepare cities as the more comfortable and healthy places to live, with the more efficient models and consuming money and time. Originality/value: The study achievements are expected to be applied not only in Tehran but also in other climate zones as the pattern in more eco-city design strategies.

203,3.0,2020,Article,Learning from urban form to predict building heights,"Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. © 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

204,7.0,2020,Article,Using GIS and machine learning to classify residential status of urban buildings in low and middle income settings,"Utilising satellite images for planning and development is becoming a common practice as computational power and machine learning capabilities expand. In this paper, we explore the use of satellite image derived building footprint data to classify the residential status of urban buildings in low and middle income countries. A recently developed ensemble machine learning building classification model is applied for the first time to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to Nigeria. The model is informed by building footprint and label data of greater completeness and attribute consistency than have previously been available for these countries. A GIS workflow is described that semiautomates the preparation of data for input to the model. The workflow is designed to be particularly useful to those who apply the model to additional countries and use input data from diverse sources. Results show that the ensemble model correctly classifies between 85% and 93% of structures as residential and nonresidential across both countries. The classification outputs are likely to be valuable in the modelling of human population distributions, as well as in a range of related applications such as urban planning, resource allocation, and service delivery. © 2020 by the authors.

205,8.0,2020,Article,A data-informed analytical approach to human-scale greenway planning: Integrating multi-sourced urban data with machine learning algorithms,"Urban greenways have been recognized as an important strategy to improve human-scale quality in high-density built environments. Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Data-informed urban design; Greenway planning; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-sourced urban data,"Tang Z., Ye Y., Jiang Z., Fu C., Huang R., Yao D.",10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126871
207,21.0,2020,Article,"A data-driven approach for multi-scale GIS-based building energy modeling for analysis, planning and support decision making","Urban planners, local authorities, and energy policymakers often develop strategic sustainable energy plans for the urban building stock in order to minimize overall energy consumption and emissions. Planning at such scales could be informed by building stock modeling using existing building data and Geographic Information System-based mapping. However, implementing these processes involves several issues, namely, data availability, data inconsistency, data scalability, data integration, geocoding, and data privacy. This research addresses the aforementioned information challenges by proposing a generalized integrated methodology that implements bottom-up, data-driven, and spatial modeling approaches for multi-scale Geographic Information System mapping of building energy modeling. This study uses the Irish building stock to map building energy performance at multiple scales. The generalized data-driven methodology uses approximately 650,000 Irish Energy Performance Certificates buildings data to predict more than 2 million buildings’ energy performance. In this case, the approach delivers a prediction accuracy of 88% using deep learning algorithms. These prediction results are then used for spatial modeling at multiple scales from the individual building level to a national level. Furthermore, these maps are coupled with available spatial resources (social, economic, or environmental data) for energy planning, analysis, and support decision-making. The modeling results identify clusters of buildings that have a significant potential for energy savings within any specific region. Geographic Information System-based modeling aids stakeholders in identifying priority areas for implementing energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the stakeholders could target local communities for retrofit campaigns, which would enhance the implementation of sustainable energy policy decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Building energy performance; Data-driven approaches; Energy performance certificate; GIS modeling; Machine learning; Urban building energy modeling; Urban planning,"Ali U., Shamsi M.H., Bohacek M., Purcell K., Hoare C., Mangina E., O'Donnell J.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115834
214,4.0,2020,Article,"GIS-enabled digital twin system for sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions: A case study of Jeonju city, south Korea","Despite the growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project—in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

215,4.0,2020,Article,Combining CityGML files and data-driven models for microclimate simulations in a tropical city,"This research first developed a solution to convert LOD 2 CityGML files to LOD 1 files. Then, by using LOD 1 files as geometric inputs, this study developed a python-based microclimate simulation program based on a customized machine learning algorithm to better understand the relationship between urban morphology and outdoor temperature. The integration with the 3D geometry makes this prediction model not only useful to the scientific research, but also as an urban planning tool for environmentally sustainable design. For model development, meteorological data and urban morphology features were used to predict the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily daytime average temperature and daily night-time average temperature. Voting regression (VOT) based on ordinary least square and random forests was used as the regression model. The average CV-R2 and the CV-RMSE predicted by VOT for the outdoor air temperature were 0.84 and 0.52°C. Compared with ordinary least squares, VOT improved R2 by an average of 18% and RMSE by an average of 24%. Sensitivity analysis indicated the daytime temperature was inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of urban canyon streets. In tropical climates, greenery can be used as a cooling measure. A negative logarithmic relationship was found between the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and green plot ratio. This shows that as the green coverage increases, the cooling effect of greenery increases, and it is more effective to adopt greenery early in areas with less vegetation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",CityGML; Data-driven model; Outdoor air temperature; Urban canyon aspect ratio,"Chen S., Zhang W., Wong N.H., Ignatius M.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107314
216,6.0,2020,Article,Urban ambient air temperature estimation using hyperlocal data from smart vehicle-borne sensors,"High-quality temperature data at a finer spatio-temporal scale is critical for analyzing the risk of heat exposure and hazards in urban environments. The variability of urban landscapes makes cities a challenging environment for quantifying heat exposure. Most of the existing heat hazard studies have inherent limitations on two fronts; first, the spatio-temporal granularities are too coarse, and second, the inability to track the ambient air temperature (AAT) instead of land surface temperature (LST). Overcoming these limitations requires developing models for mapping the variability in heat exposure in urban environments. We investigated an integrated approach for mapping urban heat hazards by harnessing a diverse set of high-resolution measurements, including both ground-based and satellite-based temperature data. We mounted vehicle-borne mobile sensors on city buses to collect high-frequency temperature data throughout 2018 and 2019. Our research also incorporated key biophysical parameters and Landsat 8 LST data into Random Forest regression modeling to map the hyperlocal variability of heat hazard over areas not covered by the buses. The vehicle-borne temperature sensor data showed large temperature differences within the city, with the largest variations of up to 10 °C and morning-afternoon diurnal changes at a magnitude around 20 °C. Random Forest modeling on noontime (11:30 am – 12:30 pm) data to predict AAT produced accurate results with a mean absolute error of 0.29 °C and successfully showcased the enhanced granularity in urban heat hazard mapping. These maps revealed well-defined hyperlocal variabilities in AAT, which were not evident with other research approaches. Urban core and dense residential areas revealed larger than 5 °C AAT differences from their nearby green spaces. The sensing framework developed in this study can be easily implemented in other urban areas, and findings from this study will be beneficial in understanding the heat vulnerabilities of individual communities. It can be used by the local government to devise targeted hazard mitigation efforts such as increasing green space, developing better heat-safety policies, and exposure warning for workers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Human thermal comfort; Machine learning; Mobile sensing; Smart and connected communities; Urban heat hazards,"Yin Y., Tonekaboni N.H., Grundstein A., Mishra D.R., Ramaswamy L., Dowd J.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101538
217,10.0,2020,Article,"Urban pluvial flooding prediction by machine learning approaches – a case study of Shenzhen city, China","Urban pluvial flooding is a threatening natural hazard in urban areas all over the world, especially in recent years given its increasing frequency of occurrence. In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events – especially in the future climate – this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning. © 2020 The Authors",Machine learning; Rainfall threshold; Shenzhen city; Urban pluvial flooding,"Ke Q., Tian X., Bricker J., Tian Z., Guan G., Cai H., Huang X., Yang H., Liu J.",10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103719
218,5.0,2020,Article,A hybrid air pollutant concentration prediction model combining secondary decomposition and sequence reconstruction,"Acid rain is a serious threat to terrestrial ecosystems. To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction.

This study uses the large inflow of immigrants in Barcelona between 1998 and 2008 to study whether the configuration of buildings and open urban areas in a block is associated with the residential segregation of immigrants—a proxy for social interaction. Based on a rich set of shape metrics, I use machine learning techniques to classify each block in Barcelona into one of eight typologies, which provide a summary measure of their built environment. I then combine these data with measures of residential segregation constructed at the building level using data on the exact address of each resident of Barcelona. The findings show that some features of the built environment of a block—as measured by the typologies—are systematically associated with reduced residential segregation of Spaniards and newly arrived immigrants in that block. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Machine learning; Segregation; Urban design; Urban form,Salazar Miranda A.,10.1016/j.cities.2020.102852
221,2.0,2020,Conference Paper,Machine learning-based methods for path loss prediction in urban environment for LTE networks,"This paper presents prediction path loss models in an urban environment for cellular networks with the help of machine learning methods. For this goal, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms are exploited and assessed. The training and testing procedure is carried out with the help of a path loss dataset generated by simulated results considering a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network utilizing a digital terrain model. The simulation takes into account an urban environment for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) propagation condition. The results reveal that all the evaluated algorithms forecast path loss with a remarkable accuracy, providing root-mean-square errors on the order of 2. 1-2.2dB for LOS and 3. 4-4.1dB for NLOS locations, respectively. Among the examined algorithms, KNN shows the best performance, thus being an appealing option to predict path loss in urban areas. For comparison purposes, the COST231 Walfisch-Ikegami empirical model was applied, which presents the worst performance, providing the highest errors under-predicting path loss, especially in NLOS locations. © 2020 IEEE.",3D simulation; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Machine learning; Path loss prediction; Urban environment,"Moraitis N., Tsipi L., Vouyioukas D.",10.1109/WiMob50308.2020.9253369
222,4.0,2020,Article,Identifying tree traits for cooling urban heat islands—a cross-city empirical analysis,"Research Highlights: This paper presents a cross-city empirical study on micro-climatic thermal benefits of urban trees, using machine-learning analysis to identify the importance of several in situ measured tree physiognomy traits for cooling. Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

223,4.0,2020,Article,Systematizing and upscaling urban climate change mitigation,"The question of what cities can contribute to mitigation and adapting to climate change is gaining traction among researchers and policy makers alike. However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities. © 2020 The Author(s).

This enables data-driven building and energy models to capture the urban dynamics, specifically the intrinsic occupant and energy use behavioural profiles that are not usually considered in traditional models. Although there are related reviews, none investigated urban data for use in modelling occupant behaviour and energy use at multiple scales, from buildings to neighbourhood to city. This survey paper aims to fill this gap by providing a critical summary and analysis of the works reported in the literature. We present the different sources of occupant-centric urban data that are useful for data-driven modelling and categorise the range of applications and recent data-driven modelling techniques for urban behaviour and energy modelling, along with the traditional stochastic and simulation-based approaches.

227,1.0,2020,Article,Water Distribution-Transportation Interface Connectivity Responding to Urban Geospatial Morphology,"Water distribution and transportation systems are geospatially colocated, forming a network of connections. This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity.

228,6.0,2020,Article,Predicting urban cold-air paths using boosted regression trees,"Ensuring the transport of colder air masses from rural surroundings or inner urban open spaces into the dense urban center is a vital approach for reducing nocturnal warming of urban areas in summer, i.e. the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Hence, cold-air paths are an important mitigation aspect in urban planning. The identification of cold-air paths by field measurements, however, is time-consuming and it is difficult to cover larger spatial domains (e.g. entire cities). Therefore, we used a machine learning technique, boosted regression trees (BRT), for estimating the spatial distribution of cold-air paths in three German cities (Braunschweig, Freiburg, Stuttgart). We identified the most important predictor variables for cold-air path occurrence and tested the spatial transferability of BRT models from one training city to the other study cities. Three variables explaining differences in surface elevation indicated strongest influence on spatial distribution of cold-air paths: relative surface elevation, topographic position index, and topographic wind index. We achieved predictions for the spatial distribution of cold-air paths for cities the model was trained on, resulting in model performances of 0.85 < AUC < 0.96 (AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Model transfers to other cities, however, achieved only poor to moderate results (0.5 < AUC < 0.8). The city of Freiburg tended to be the most suitable basis for a general model, since it covers the largest range of conditions. Transfer works best for ‘similar’ cities, i.e. cities with a comparable range of predictor variables and morphological structure. Cold-air path identification via BRT modelling appeared to be a promising method delivering helpful information for urban planning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Grunwald L., Schneider A.-K., Schröder B., Weber S.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103843

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =∼130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities. Ethics and dissemination This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations. ©",epidemiology; public health; statistics & research methods,"Clark S.N., Alli A.S., Brauer M., Ezzati M., Baumgartner J., Toledano M.B., Hughes A.F., Nimo J., Bedford Moses J., Terkpertey S., Vallarino J., Agyei-Mensah S., Agyemang E., Nathvani R., Muller E., Bennett J., Wang J., Beddows A., Kelly F., Barratt B., Beevers S., Arku R.E.",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035798
232,17.0,2020,Article,Landslide susceptibility assessment of wildfire burnt areas through earth-observation techniques and a machine learning-based approach,"Climate change has increased the likelihood of the occurrence of disasters like wildfires, floods, storms, and landslides worldwide in the last years. Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques).

Land-use distribution is one of the key factors affecting air quality, and research on the impact of land-use distribution on air pollution has drawn wide attention. However, considerable studies have mostly used linear regression models, which fail to capture the nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns) and to show how impacts on PM2.5 vary with land-use magnitudes. In addition, related studies have generally focused on annual analyses, ignoring the seasonal variability of the impact of land-use distribution on PM2.5, thus leading to possible estimation biases for PM2.5 . This study was designed to address these issues and assess the impacts of land-use distribution on PM2.5 in Weifang, China. A machine learning statistical model, the boosted regression tree (BRT), was applied to measure nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5, capture how land-use magnitude impacts PM2.5 across different seasons, and explore the policy implications for urban planning. The main conclusions are that the air quality will significantly improve with an increase in grassland and forest area, especially below 8% and 20%, respectively. When the distribution of construction land is greater than around 10%, the PM2.5 pollution can be seriously substantially increased with the increment of their areas. The impact of gardens and farmland presents seasonal characteristics. It is noted that as the weather becomes colder, the inhibitory effect of vegetation distribution on the PM2.5 concentration gradually decreases, while the positive impacts of artificial surface distributions, such as construction land and roads, are aggravated because leaves drop off in autumn (September–November) and winter (December–February). According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that Weifang should strengthen pollution control in winter, for instance, expand the coverage areas of evergreen vegetation like Pinus bungeana Zucc. and Euonymus japonicus Thunb, and increase the width and numbers of branches connecting different main roads. The findings also provide quantitative and optimal land-use planning and strategies to minimize PM2.5 pollution, referring to the status of regional urbanization and greening construction. © 2020 by the authors.

239,23.0,2020,Article,Simulating urban land use change by integrating a convolutional neural network with vector-based cellular automata,"Vector-based cellular automata (VCA) models have been applied in land use change simulations at fine scales. However, the neighborhood effects of the driving factors are rarely considered in the exploration of the transition suitability of cells, leading to lower simulation accuracy. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-VCA model that adopts the CNN to extract the high-level features of the driving factors within a neighborhood of an irregularly shaped cell and discover the relationships between multiple land use changes and driving factors at the neighborhood level. The proposed model was applied to simulate urban land use changes in Shenzhen, China. Compared with several VCA models using other machine learning methods, the proposed CNN-VCA model obtained the highest simulation accuracy (figure-of-merit = 0.361). The results indicated that the CNN-VCA model can effectively uncover the neighborhood effects of multiple driving factors on the developmental potential of land parcels and obtain more details on the morphological characteristics of land parcels. Moreover, the land use patterns of 2020 and 2025 under an ecological control strategy were simulated to provide decision support for urban planning. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cellular automata; convolutional neural network; fine scale; Land use change; urban planning,"Zhai Y., Yao Y., Guan Q., Liang X., Li X., Pan Y., Yue H., Yuan Z., Zhou J.",10.1080/13658816.2020.1711915
241,,2020,Article,A deep learning approach to urban street functionality prediction based on centrality measures and stacked denoising autoencoder,"In urban planning and transportation management, the centrality characteristics of urban streets are vital measures to consider. Centrality can help in understanding the structural properties of dense traffic networks that affect both human life and activity in cities. Many cities classify urban streets to provide stakeholders with a group of street guidelines for possible new rehabilitation such as sidewalks, curbs, and setbacks. Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments. In our work, a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) predicts a street's functionality, then logistic regression is used as a classifier. Our proposed classifier can differentiate between four different classes adopted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT): principal arterial road, minor arterial road, collector road, and local road. The SDAE-based model showed that regular grid configurations with repeated patterns are more influential in forming the functionality of road networks compared to those with less regularity in their spatial structure. © 2020 by the authors.

242,1.0,2020,Article,BISTRO: Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization,"The current trend toward urbanization and adoption of flexible and innovative mobility technologies will have complex and difficult-to-predict effects on urban transportation systems. Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design. This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO's utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices. © 2020 ACM.",Agent-based models; big data; computing with heterogeneous data; digital decision support systems; human mobility; intelligent transportation systems; smart cities; system dynamics; urban informatics,"Feygin S.A., Lazarus J.R., Forscher E.H., Golfier-Vetterli V., Lee J.W., Gupta A., Waraich R.A., Sheppard C.J.R., Bayen A.M.",10.1145/3384344

GNSS signals are easily blocked in urban environments, which leads to discontinuity and instability of position solution. With the construction of BeiDou and Galileo satellite navigation system in the final stage, multi-satellite fusion will be the future development trend of GNSSs. This paper introduces the mathematical fusion model of Galileo and BeiDou satellite navigation system, typical urban coverage conditions are simulated, and a detailed in the aspects of number of visible satellites, positioning error and PDOP values are analysed. The results show that the positioning accuracy of the integrated navigation system in the horizontal is within 3 m, the elevation is within 5 m, and the PDOP value are less than 1.5 in the open sky condition. In any coverage conditions, Galileo stand-alone system cannot guarantee the positioning continuity in the whole day, and positioning performance is the worst in the north coverage condition, unable to obtain the position solutions for more than 40% time in the whole day. In the north coverage condition, BeiDou has the best positioning performance, with a minimum of 4 visible satellites and 99% of PDOP values are less than 10. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Wu Y., Yang Z., Xu N., Yu J.",10.1088/1742-6596/1550/3/032007
247,32.0,2020,Article,The effects of 3D architectural patterns on the urban surface temperature at a neighborhood scale: Relative contributions and marginal effects,"Urban architecture is an important contributor to urban heat island (UHI) effects. Yet thorough investigations into how three-dimensional (3D) architectural patterns influence urban thermal conditions collectively and individually are limited. This study bridges this gap by adopting a machine learning method, boosted regression tree (BRT), to analyze the relative influences and marginal effects of 3D urban architecture on land surface temperature (LST). Ten architectural metrics are incorporated to describe the composition and configuration of 3D architectural patterns at a neighborhood scale in the typical megacity of Shanghai. The results show that in summer, the building coverage ratio (BCR), mean architecture height (MAH), mean architecture height standard deviation (AHSD) and mean architecture projection area (MAPA) are the most influential factors, with relative contributions of 39.3%, 16.5%, 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively. The regulation amplitudes (ΔT) of the dominant metrics for the neighborhood average LST temperature are 2.7 °C, 0.9 °C, 0.6 °C, and 0.6 °C, respectively. Moreover, with the LST, the BCR exhibits a monotonic positive correlation, the MAH and AHSD show a stepwise negative correlation, and the MAPA shows a combination of positive and negative correlation. It is generally recommended to decrease the development intensity and architectural base area, while increase the building height and roughness to improve the urban thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale. The dominant contributors and related marginal effects are generally consistent across different seasons. These findings can provide quantitative insights for mitigating the LST effects via rational design and management of 3D architectural patterns. Given the distinctive insights provided, the BRT method is recommended for disentangling the relationship between LST and environmental variables in upcoming studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",3D architectural pattern; Boosted regression tree (BRT); Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI),"Sun F., Liu M., Wang Y., Wang H., Che Y.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120706
248,15.0,2020,Article,"Comparison of random forest model and frequency ratio model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in Yunyang county (Chongqing, China)","To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR) model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters; especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments. © 2020 by the authors.

250,3.0,2020,Article,Design of machine learning model for Urban planning and management improvement,"With the aid of artificial intelligence, this paper builds a machine learning model with the KNN algorithm to optimize the traditional method of urban planning and management (UPM). The optimization is realized through two steps. First, the relevant theories of the updated UPM of livelihood oriented UPM (LOUPM) are explored for the later machine learning architecture design. People's livelihood has a great influence on UPM. Livelihood orientation makes the complex UPM even more complicated due to diverse living needs of citizens. This paper analyzes the deeper relationship between the people's livelihood and UPM, systematically studies the function and connotation of the people's livelihood behavior, and profoundly discusses current contradictions and restraining factors. Second, based on a better understanding of LOUPM, this paper further proposes an artificial intelligence approach to select most related factors to optimize UPM from databases. In the first paper of this series, in the analysis of the relevant UPM theories, three scopes of LOUPM are concluded to be the evaluation of data sets: authority, time, and space. Then, this paper continues to design a software model with the KNN algorithm to evaluate the urban plans and generates optimization advice for the user. Based on this research, it is possible to explore LOUPM. In order to make every effort to seek ways and methods to meet the challenge of the LOUPM in the new period, and by introducing a creative computing approach of government management and social governance, this article can contribute to the growing demand of China's urbanization process. © 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.

253,8.0,2020,Article,Machine learning-based and 3d kinematic models for rockfall hazard assessment using LiDAR Data and GIS,"Rockfall is one of the most hazardous phenomena in mountainous and hilly regions with high and steep terrain. Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment. © 2020 by the authors.",3D kinematic modeling; GIS model; LiDAR; Machine learning; Rockfall hazard,"Fanos A.M., Pradhan B., Alamri A., Lee C.-W.",10.3390/rs12111755
255,9.0,2020,Article,"Exploring the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership, using both inferential and machine learning approaches","Ride-sourcing services are getting more popular each year, and their markets are growing. Much has been speculated, but not much has been tested regarding the impacts of ride-sourcing services on the transportation system. In this study, we examine the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership of households, by using the most up-to-date (2017) national household travel survey data. To better capture the effect of ride-sourcing services on vehicle ownership, we controlled for the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of households and built environment variables, i.e., density, diversity, design, and distance to transit. Two approaches were used to model vehicle ownership: a probabilistic or inferential model (i.e., multilevel Poisson), and a machine learning method (i.e., random forest). This is the first study to utilize such advanced methods to model vehicle ownership and capture non-linear relationships, using the largest sample of household travel records ever assembled for such a study. The results suggest that there is a negative correlation between using ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership. Vehicle ownership is also negatively associated with the number of years Uber, as the biggest ride-sourcing service, has operated in a county. The relative contributions of ride-sourcing variables, however, are very limited compared to other variables controlled in this study which makes intuitive sense. For urban planning and design practices, this study suggests that the probability of car shedding will increase if the usage of ride-sourcing services becomes a habit, these services become more available, and built environments become more dense, connected, and transit-served. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Multilevel modeling; Random forest; Ride-sourcing services; Uber; Vehicle ownership,"Sabouri S., Brewer S., Ewing R.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103797

To date, the unprecedented development of location-based services has generated a large amount of unstructured address data. Traditional address matching methods mainly focus on the literal similarity of address records and are therefore not applicable to the unstructured address data. In this study, we introduce an address matching method based on deep learning to identify the semantic similarity between address records. First, we train the word2vec model to transform the address records into their corresponding vector representations. Next, we apply the enhanced sequential inference model (ESIM), a deep text-matching model, to make local and global inferences to determine if two addresses match. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, we fine-tune the model with real-world address data from the Shenzhen Address Database and compare the outputs with those of several popular address matching methods. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a higher matching accuracy for unstructured address records, with its precision, recall, and F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) reaching 0.97 on the test set. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deep neural network; Geocoding; machine learning; semantic matching; word2vec,"Lin Y., Kang M., Wu Y., Du Q., Liu T.",10.1080/13658816.2019.1681431
265,19.0,2020,Article,Patterns of historical and future urban expansion in Nepal,"Globally, urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented rate at the cost of agricultural and forested lands in peri-urban areas fringing larger cities. Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal. © 2020 by the author.",Cropland loss; Machine learning models; Markov chain; Urban expansion,"Rimal B., Sloan S., Keshtkar H., Sharma R., Rijal S., Shrestha U.B.",10.3390/rs12040628

267,,2020,Conference Paper,Machine learning for comparative urban planning at scale: An aviation case study,"Aviation is in flux, experiencing 5.4% yearly growth over the last two decades. However, with COVID-19 aviation was hard hit. This, along with its contribution to global warming, has led to louder calls to limit its use. This situation emphasizes how urban planners and technologists could contribute to understanding and responding to this change. This paper explores a novel workflow of performing image-based machine learning (ML) on satellite images of over 1.000 world airports that were algonthmically collated using European Space Agency Sentinel2 API. From these, the top 350 United States airports were analyzed with land use parameters extracted around the airport using computer vision, which were mapped against their passenger footfall numbers. The results demonstrate a scalable approach to identify how easy and beneficial it would be for certain airports to expand or contract and how this would impact the surrounding urban environment in terms of pollution and congestion. The generic nature of this workflow makes it possible to potentially extend this method to any large infrastructure and compare and analyze specific features across a large number of images while being able to understand the same feature through time. This is critical in answering key typology-based urban design challenges at a higher level and without needing to perform on-ground studies, which could be expensive and time-consuming. © Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

274,1.0,2020,Article,Evaluating multivariable statistical methods for downscaling nighttime land surface temperature in urban areas,"For research and practice in fields such as the environment and meteorology, nighttime land surface temperature (LST) images at fine resolution provide important basic data. Since only a few satellite sensors can take fine-resolution thermal infrared images at night, such images are rather scarce. Downscaling of coarse-resolution LST images is a potential method for obtaining high-resolution LST images. However, downscaling methods have been mostly proposed for daytime LST images. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of methods that combine multiple explanatory variables and machine learning algorithms for downscaling coarse-resolution nighttime LST images in urban areas. Verification showed that the errors in the downscaling results were acceptable (mean absolute errors within 2 K). The resulting images could depict the spatial pattern of night LST in the study area in great detail. It was demonstrated that visible-near infrared images taken in the daytime could be used for downscaling of nighttime LST images, the rationality of which was deduced. It was also demonstrated that the performance of the spectral explanatory variables in nighttime LST downscalingwas not lower than that of the mechanism explanatory variables. This method has high application value in many academic and practical efforts, such as land-atmosphere interface radiation budget studies, suitability assessments of human settlement, and urban environmental planning. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Managing the urban economy needs to consider environmental restrictions, environmental monitoring tasks, engineering facilities, and transport. Operational control over the urban environment and the surrounding area can be produced using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the collected data can be processed using a wide range of software and hardware technologies related to the field of artificial intelligence. However, along with any fairly new technology, intelligent unmanned technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. Strengths are mobility and efficiency, relative cheapness, the possibility of a high degree of automation, whereas weaknesses are short flight time, dependence on weather conditions, the certain outstanding tasks of data management and processing. This paper considers the possibilities of using intelligent unmanned technologies based on UAVs for solving the problems of monitoring the urban environment of the Kazakhstan megalopolises. Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles.

Different ways of landscape design can add natural landscape to the urban ecosystem, and will not destroy the ecological environment, but will gradually improve the quality of the ecological environment. However, the design methods of landscape in urban planning in China are not perfect enough, there are many problems, and it is difficult to improve the ecological environment of the city. Therefore, in the process of urban planning, the relevant personnel should fully understand the design methods of landscape, and constantly innovate to create a quality living environment for people. In this paper, we propose the landscape architecture system based on mobile edge streaming media data processing.

278,3.0,2020,Conference Paper,NLOS multipath detection using convolutional neural network,"In global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning, GNSS satellites are often obstructed by buildings, leading to reflected and diffracted signals, which are known as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. Such signals cause major GNSS positioning (also known as “NLOS multipath”) errors. In this paper, a novel NLOS multipath detection technique using a machine-learning approach to improve the positioning accuracy in urban environments is proposed. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to a direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of an NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. To consider the change in shape of the correlation values of NLOS signals and their temporal variation, we propose a method for constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based NLOS discriminator. Furthermore, we propose a method for applying the NLOS probability, which is the output of the CNN, to the positioning calculation. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conducted NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We compared the proposed method with a method using a simple NN. As the experiment results indicate, the proposed method can correctly discriminate approximately 98% of NLOS multipath signals, and the discrimination rate of the proposed CNN-based method is higher than that of the simple NN-based approach. Furthermore, we improved the positioning accuracy from 34.1 to 1.6 m using the proposed method and concluded that the proposed approach can increase the positioning accuracy in urban environments. © 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

279,1.0,2020,Conference Paper,A new method for non-line-of-sight GNSS signal detection for positioning accuracy improvement in urban environments,"The classification of the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals is one of the major problems for robust GNSS positioning and the shadow matching in urban environments. The existing techniques include the multi-sensor integration, 3D map aid, using a dual-polarized antenna, an omnidirectional camera aid are proposed to solve the classification problem. However, they all require external hardware or up-to-date map, which is expensive or impractical for mass-market applications. Consistency checking with the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is widely used for the detection of NLOS signals, but it is efficient only when the majority of the received signals are LOS signals. Machine learning methods, including the decision tree, the support vector machine (SVM) have been explored to classify LOS and NLOS with good accuracy. However, all current machine learning based method only utilize information within one epoch, all the inter-epoch information and data features in time series are lost, and the information of signal propagation in the complex urban environments is not fully manifested in the Rinex level observation and NMEA level observations in one single epoch. In this paper, a multivariate Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (MLSTM-FCN) based signal classification method is proposed. With the aid of the convolution layer and long short term memory block, this method handles the data features in both time domain and value domain. Six time series features of GNSS signal, including differenced C/N0, time differenced ambiguity, double difference phase and pseudorange, phase and pseudorange consistency are analyzed and used as the input of the MLSTM-FCN. Datasets from two locations in the urban Calgary are collected, each of which is used for training and testing purposes respectively. The results reveal that, compared to the SVM classification method, the overall testing accuracy of the newly proposed classifier is improved from 93.00% to 95.97% for the Rinex level observation, and from 92.99% to 93.83 for the NMEA level observation. This improved classification accuracy brought by the proposed classifier is encouraging since it will enhance the robustness of the conventional GNSS positioning and the shadow matching based navigation system by reducing unbounded NLOS signal errors in urban environments and result in significant improvement in positioning accuracy. Compared to the SVM classifier aided single point positioning (SPP) test, the accuracy in the form of RMS of the MLSTM-FCN aided SPP test can be improved by 24.3%, 17.8% and 24.4% in the East, North and Up directions respectively, and the rate of the valid solution can be increased from 99.02% to 99.94%. The new method has the potential to be widely applied by various receiver types with the output of the raw observation or only with the NMEA observations output. © 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

284,5.0,2020,Conference Paper,Support Vector Machine for Path Loss Predictions in Urban Environment,"Path Loss (PL) propagation models are important for accurate radio network design and planning. In this paper, we propose a new radio propagation model for PL predictions in urban environment using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Field measurement campaigns are conducted in urban environment to obtain mobile network and path loss information of radio signals transmitted at 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz frequencies. SVM model is trained with field measurement data to predict path loss in urban propagation environment. Performance of SVM model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Standard Error Deviation (SED). Results show that SVM achieve MAE, MSE, RMSE and SED of 7.953 dB, 99.966 dB, 9.998 dB and 9.940 dB respectively.

290,1.0,2020,Article,Uncertainties of human perception in visual image interpretation in complex urban environments,"Today satellite images are mostly exploited automatically due to advances in image classification methods. Manual visual image interpretation (MVII), however, still plays a significant role e.g., to generate training data for machine-learning algorithms or for validation purposes. In certain urban environments, however, of e.g., highest densities and structural complexity, textural and spectral complications in overlapping roof-structures still demand the human interpreter if one aims to capture individual building structures. The cognitive perception and real-world experience are still inevitable. Against these backgrounds, this article aims at quantifying and interpreting the uncertainties of mapping rooftop footprints of such areas. We focus on the agreement among interpreters and which aspects of perception and elements of image interpretation affect mapping. Ten test persons digitized six complex built-up areas. Hereby, we receive quantitative information about spatial variables of buildings to systematically check the consistency and congruence of results. An additional questionnaire reveals qualitative information about obstacles. Generally, we find large differences among interpreters' mapping results and a high consistency of results for the same interpreter. We measure rising deviations correlate with a rising morphologic complexity. High degrees of individuality are expressed e.g., in time consumption, in-situ- or geographic information system (GIS)-precognition whereas data source mostly influences the mapping procedure. By this study, we aim to fill a gap as prior research using MVII often does not implement an uncertainty analysis or quantify mapping aberrations. We conclude that remote sensing studies should not only rely unquestioned on MVII for validation; furthermore, data and methods are needed to suspend uncertainty. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Cognition; earth observation; elements of image interpretation; level of individual buildings (LoD-1); manual visual image interpretation (MVII); perception; uncertainty; urban morphology,"Kraff N.J., Wurm M., Taubenbock H.",10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3011543
292,,2020,Conference Paper,Characterizing air quality in urban areas with mobile measurement and high resolution open spatial data: Comparison of different machine-learning approaches using a visual interface,"Air quality is one of the most important topics in our urban life, as it is of great significance for human health and urban planning. However, accurate assessment and prediction of air quality in urban areas are difficult. In major cities, typically only a limited number of air quality monitoring stations are available, and inferring air quality in the un-sampled areas throughout the city is challenging. On the other hand, air quality varies in the urban areas non-linearly; it is highly spatially dependent and considerably influenced by multiple factors, such as building distribution, traffic situation and land uses. In this research, we model air quality in the city of Augsburg using spatial features and high quality sensor data. We identify spatial features such as types and areas of different land uses, road networks with high resolution. We integrate open available data to the air quality prediction. In this regard, we compare a simple baseline model with linear regression models (Ordinary Least-Squares and Ridge Regression) and tree-based machine-learning models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest). In our evaluation, given the non-linearity of the data, tree-based models outperform all linear models, which are commonly used in literatures. In addition, we created an interactive and visual dashboard. This dashboard demonstrates the analytical workflow, gives insight into model performance and uncertainty and visualizes the results. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.",Air quality; Dashboard; Land-use regression; Machine-learning,"Shen Y., Lehmler S., Murshed S.M., Riedel T.",10.1007/978-3-030-51005-3_12

This study is also used to manage the energy consumption in urban planning and smart city applications. The previous researchers demonstrate that the big data analysis process is more complex. We use different kinds of sensors such as traffic congestion, weather, smart home, water, and vehicular sensor to collect the resource data. The framework is divided into three phases. The first phase is responsible for collecting the data using IoT devices and interconnects with elasticity (energy-saving) manager. The second phase is data handling operation using MapReduce framework. Third phase deals with decision-making which is an important step to classify the events and produce the decisions accurately. To do this, machine learning concept of deep learning algorithms is used and it produces the decisions more effectively.

305,11.0,2020,Article,A machine learning-based classification system for urban built-up areas using multiple classifiers and data sources,"Information about urban built-up areas is important for urban planning and management. However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification (BAIC) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the BAIC were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the BAIC to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest (POI), Road Network (RN), nighttime light (NTL), a combination of POI and RN data (POI_RN), a combination of POI and NTL data (POI_NTL), a combination of RN and NTL data (RN_NTL), and a combination of POI, RN, and NTL data (POI_RN_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and AdaBoost. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 76 to 89%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. The largest F1 value and OA were obtained using the POI_RN_NTL data and AdaBoost, while the largest AUC was obtained using POI_RN_NTL and POI_NTL data against AdaBoost, LR, and RF; and (2) the advantages of the BAIC include its support for multi-source input data, its objective accuracy assessment, and its robust classifiers. The BAIC can quickly and efficiently realize the automatic classification of urban built-up areas at a reasonably low cost and can be readily applied to other urban areas in the world where any kind of POI, RN, or NTL data coverage is available. The results of this study are expected to provide timely and effective reference information for urban planning and urban management departments, and could also potentially be used to develop large-scale maps of urban built-up areas in the future. © 2019 by the authors.",Machine learning; NTL; POI; Road network; Urban built-up area,"Sun L., Tang L., Shao G., Qiu Q., Lan T., Shao J.",10.3390/RS12010091

315,,2019,Conference Paper,Urban street contexts classification using convolutional neural networks and streets imagery,"The classification of streets on road networks has been focused on the vehicular transportational features of streets. Examples of street labels include arterials, major roads, minor roads and so forth based on their transportational use. City authorities on the other hand have been shifting to more wholistic planning of streets. The modern approach towards designing and planning streets is more inclusive of the street context, meaning the side use of a street combined with the transportational features of a street. Several city authorities are developing new classification schemes for street context that extends traditional classification methods to include the use of land on the sides of a street. In those classification schemes, streets are labeled for example as commercial throughway, residential neighborhood, park etc. This modern approach to urban planning have been adopted by major cities such as the city of San Francisco, the state of Florida and Pennsylvania among many others. Currently, the process of labeling streets according to their contexts is manual and hence is tedious and time consuming. It will require manual labor to regularly relabel streets as the city develops. In this paper, we propose an approach to deploy advancements in computer vision towards modern urban planning. We propose a framework for automatic classification of street contexts. Using labeled street imagery we train deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform the classification of street context. We show that CNN models can perform well achieving accuracies in the 81% to 87% range. We test various CNN architectures and report on their performances. © 2019 IEEE.",Applications; Big Data; Computer Vision; Data from the wild; IoT; Urban Computing,"Alhasoun F., Gonzalez M.",10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00198
318,16.0,2019,Article,Deprivation pockets through the lens of convolutional neural networks,"Machine learning techniques have been frequently applied to map urban deprivation (commonly referred to as slums) in very high-resolution satellite images. Among these, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown exceptional efficiency in automated deprivation mapping at the local scale. Yet these networks have never been used to map very small heterogeneous deprivation areas (pockets) at large scale. This study proposes and evaluates a U-Net-Compound model to map deprivation pockets in Bangalore, India. The model only relies on RGB satellite images with a resolution of 2 m as these are more commonly accessible to local urban planning departments. The experiment assumes a practical situation where only limited reference data is available for the model to learn the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets. It tests whether an updated map of deprivation pockets can be obtained with limited information. The model performance to map a large number of deprivation pockets is examined by incrementally changing the model architecture and the amount of training data. Results show that the proposed model is sensitive to the amount of spatial information contained in the training data. Once sufficient spatial information is learnt through a few samples, the city scale mapping accuracy outperforms existing models in mapping small deprivation pockets, achieving a Jaccard Index of 54%. This study demonstrated that a well-designed convolutional neural network can map the existence, extent, as well as distribution patterns of deprivation pockets at the city scale with limited training data, which is essential for upscaling research outputs to provide important information for the formulation of pro-poor policies. © 2019",Bangalore; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deprivation pockets; Slums,"Wang J., Kuffer M., Roy D., Pfeffer K.",10.1016/j.rse.2019.111448
322,18.0,2019,Article,Data-driven model for cross ventilation potential in high-density cities based on coupled CFD simulation and machine learning,"Effective urban ventilation through decent urban planning and building design can alleviate the deterioration of the urban built environment. However, natural ventilation requirements and guidelines in current building codes and standards are either qualitative or quantitative but subject to an absolute indoor airspeed threshold without considering the outdoor wind environment. To fill this gap, this paper develops an urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and defines a novel ventilation index to assess natural ventilation potential. The index considers wind environments of both indoor and outdoor spaces. First, the coupled CFD model is developed to study wind-driven cross ventilation in high-density cities. A 3D isothermal CFD simulation is solved using the RNG k-ε turbulent model. The simulation results are compared with wind tunnel experiment data from literature. Second, six key design variables are used to generate 3840 parametric design variations for natural ventilation assessment. Third, a novel integrated index CIOIv (coupled indoor and outdoor interaction) is proposed to evaluate the wind speed ratio between the indoor area and outdoor reference area. For demonstration, CIOIv,F1 is used to represent CIOIv on the ground level. Data-driven CIOIv,F1 models are developed to predict indoor building ventilation potential for quick early design support. Compared with multivariate linear regression model, the Gradient Boosting non-linear model displays much higher prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error = 0.16 with R2 = 0.8). In early design stage, designers and engineers can skip the computational expensive CFD simulations and use this data-drive model to quickly check the building natural ventilation potentials of different design options in an urban environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Coupled CFD simulation; Data-driven model; Early design support; High-density city; Machine learning; Urban ventilation,"Ding C., Lam K.P.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106394
323,7.0,2019,Article,An urban data framework for assessing equity in cities: Comparing accessibility to healthcare facilities in Cascadia,"As cities continue to grow worldwide, policymakers and urban planners face the dual task of meeting rising demand for essential services while ensuring that benefits accrue to their citizens equitably. We propose a framework for assessing inclusivity and equity in cities, which leverages open data and machine learning techniques to inform urban infrastructure investment strategies. The framework is applied at a regional scale to compare differential access to healthcare facilities (public hospitals and clinics) via public transit in Vancouver, Seattle and Portland. We find important distributional impacts on vulnerable populations across the three cities. Portland displays the highest inequity in hospital and clinic access, and Vancouver the least, owing to Vancouver's relatively compact geographic area and high population density. For seniors, over 75% are socially excluded from hospitals and over 50% from clinics in Portland, compared to 30% and 3% respectively in Vancouver. In all three cities, significantly more residents of low-income neighborhoods are excluded from healthcare compared to their counterparts in high-income neighborhoods. This translates into proportionally higher transportation costs for low-income area residents compared with high-income area residents, regardless of whether they are socially excluded or not. Transportation costs are notably high for low-income seniors in Seattle and Vancouver. These findings pose a challenge for inclusive planning, since low-income and senior populations may require specialized services and are more reliant on public transportation than the average population. Our evaluation framework provides a systematic approach for municipalities to account for the distributional effects of transportation and service infrastructure planning, to integrate equity into their decision-making, and to learn from the successes and pitfalls of each other's urban policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Equality; Gini index; Inclusivity; Machine learning; Self-organizing maps,"Mayaud J.R., Tran M., Nuttall R.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101401

In this study, we used three statistical models [frequency ratio, certainty factor and index of entropy (IOE)] and a machine learning model [random forest (RF)] for landslide susceptibility mapping in Wanzhou County, China. First, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier geotechnical investigation reports, aerial images, and field surveys. Then, the redundant factors were excluded from the initial fourteen landslide causal factors via factor correlation analysis. To determine the most effective causal factors, landslide susceptibility evaluations were performed based on four cases with different combinations of factors (“cases”). In the analysis, 465 (70%) landslide locations were randomly selected for model training, and 200 (30%) landslide locations were selected for verification. The results showed that case 3 produced the best performance for the statistical models and that case 2 produced the best performance for the RF model. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to verify the accuracy of each model’s results for its respective optimal case.

Therefore, the security of the IoT system needs to be considered, this is related to data integrity, privacy, service stability. Through intrusion detection, activities on the IoT system will be able to be analyzed whether there are suspicious activities that can interfere with or threaten IoT services. In several previous studies in the literature, the approach used to detect intrusions in the IoT system has a high false alarm rate. This research proposes an approach through machine learning, specifically the ensemble learning approach and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) method as a method of detecting intrusions in the IoT system which is expected to produce better performance. The results of this study indicate that the proposed approach is able to detect intrusion and classify into five types of intrusion including normal intrusion, probe, dos, r2l, u2r. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed approach can improve the performance of intrusion detection in terms of accuracy to 97.02%, detection rate of 97%, false alarm rate 0.16%, compared to base learning and approaches in previous studies used as intrusion detection methods, but in processing time performance have not shown satisfying results. © 2019 IEEE.",Audit; Ensemble learning; Intrusion Detection; IoT; Machine learning,"Kurniawan A.A., Santoso H.A., Soeleman M.A., Fanani A.Z.",10.1109/ICSITech46713.2019.8987524

Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range. These threshold effects offer valuable implications for planners to achieve desirable environmental benefits efficiently. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Machine learning; Travel behavior; Urban form,"Wu X., Tao T., Cao J., Fan Y., Ramaswami A.",10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.018
339,13.0,2019,Article,Impact of community deprivation on urban park access over time: Understanding the relative role of contributors for urban planning,"As an important element of urban landscapes, park plays an important role in building environmentally sustainable cities. Thus, it is important to examine park accessibility and how it changes over time in relation to community deprivation so as to provide all residents with equitable services. Using the Gaussian-based 2SFCA (two-step floating catchment area) method, this paper analyzes dynamic park accessibility from 2016 to 2018 for communities within the Hangzhou metropolitan area in China and then quantifies the relative role of local contributors to park accessibility changes (population, park and transport network). A machine learning algorithm, which handles the interdependences of deprivation dimensions, is further employed to determine the relationship between community deprivation and park accessibility changes. Results show that park accessibility continued to grow during the study period, and most communities achieved excellent park accessibility by 2018. Population decreases and park increases contribute positively to improved park accessibility, while transport network changes have had less of an impact. Deprived communities have observed a rising trend of park accessibility, while the elderly concentrated communities are more likely to experience declined park accessibility. Our study provides a new methodological framework, which integrates the geographical accessibility model, economic chain substitution model and machine learning algorithm, for understanding the dynamic park access and associated social inequalities in rapidly urbanizing regions.

349,13.0,2019,Article,Multivariate relationships between campus design parameters and energy performance using reinforcement learning and parametric modeling,"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%.

We chose the four elements of traffic survey—travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency—as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from “WeChat,” a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects—land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types’ building area should be “4:1–3:1”; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350–450 m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15–20%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150 m is 40–50%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50 m is 45–60%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100 m is 50–70%. The results confirm that “functional mixing” and “dense road network” are beneficial to residents’ low-carbon travel proposed by the predecessors. At the same time, we found that not the higher volume rate is, the more favorable for low-carbon travel. Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system. It is not that the higher the bus station coverage is, the better for residents to travel as low-carbon, and the high popularity of public transportation in small cities will increase the carbon emission of residents. The study provides a new way to evaluate the carbon emission assessment of blocks and provides a basis for block planning with low-carbon concept. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Block; Built environment; GIS hotspot analysis; Low-carbon travel,"Hou Q., Zhang X., Li B., Zhang X., Wang W.",10.1007/s00521-018-3447-8
351,15.0,2019,Article,Allocation of emergency response centres in response to pluvial flooding-prone demand points using integrated multiple layer perceptron and maximum coverage location problem models,"The increases in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events due to global climate change and the development of additional pavement, roads and water storage sites due to population growth have enhanced the probability of pluvial flooding (PF) in urban areas. The estimation of urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However, uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the nearest ERC. © 2019",Emergency response point; GIS; Maximum coverage location problem; Pluvial flooding,"Rizeei H.M., Pradhan B., Saharkhiz M.A.",10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101205

357,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,Rapid and automated urban modeling techniques for UAS applications,"Urban models for testing UAV path-planning algorithms commonly apply simple representations using cuboid or cylinderical shapes which may not capture the characteristics of a urban environment. To address this limitation of existing urban models, this paper presents two urban modeling techniques for an unmanned aircraft flight simulation in an urban environment. The first proposed urban modeling technique is an airborne LiDAR source-based approach that incorporates machine learning algorithms to identify the number of buildings and characterize them from the LiDAR information. The second proposed urban modeling technique is an artificial urban modeling technique without any airborne LiDAR resources that applies an adaptive spacing method, an iterative algorithm to define an artificial urban environment. Unlike the LiDAR source-based approach that creates an approximated urban model, the adaptive spacing-based urban modeling algorithm generates an artificial urban environment that is visually different from a reference city, but has similar the characteristics to it. To demonstrate the two proposed urban modeling techniques, numerical simulations are conducted using open-source datasets to construct several realistic urban models. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Choi Y., Pate D., Briceno S., Mavris D.N.",10.1109/ICUAS.2019.8797943
360,12.0,2019,Article,Achieving neuroplasticity in artificial neural networks through smart cities,"Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander’s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander’s concept of “wholeness” through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities. © 2019 by the author.

365,3.0,2019,Article,Using Random Forests on Real-World City Data for Urban Planning in a Visual Semantic Decision Support System,"The constantly increasing amount and availability of urban data derived from varying sources leads to an assortment of challenges that include, among others, the consolidation, visualization, and maximal exploitation prospects of the aforementioned data. A preeminent problem affecting urban planning is the appropriate choice of location to host a particular activity (either commercial or common welfare service) or the correct use of an existing building or empty space. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these challenges availed with machine learning techniques. The proposed system combines, fuses, and merges various types of data from different sources, encodes them using a novel semantic model that can capture and utilize both low-level geometric information and higher level semantic information and subsequently feeds them to the random forests classifier, as well as other supervised machine learning models for comparisons. Our experimental evaluation on multiple real-world data sets comparing the performance of several classifiers (including Feedforward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bag of Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Naïve Bayes), indicated the superiority of Random Forests in terms of the examined performance metrics (Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall, F-measure and G-mean).",decision support system; machine learning; random forests; urban planning,"Sideris N., Bardis G., Voulodimos A., Miaoulis G., Ghazanfarpour D.",10.3390/s19102266
366,1.0,2019,Conference Paper,Learning task-specific city region partition,"The proliferation of publicly accessible urban data provide new insights on various urban tasks. A frequently used approach is to treat each region as a data sample and build a model over all the regions to observe the correlations between urban features (e.g., demographics) and the target variable (e.g., crime count). To define regions, most existing studies use fixed grids or pre-defined administrative boundaries (e.g., census tracts or community areas). In reality, however, definitions of regions should be different depending on tasks (e.g., regional crime count prediction vs. real estate prices estimation). In this paper, we propose a new problem of task-specific city region partitioning, aiming to find the best partition in a city w.r.t. a given task. We prove this is an NP-hard search problem with no trivial solution. To learn the partition, we first study two variants of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We further propose a reinforcement learning scheme for effective sampling the search space. We conduct experiments on two real datasets in Chicago (i.e., crime count and real estate price) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.",Crime prediction; Region partition; Reinforcement learning,"Wang H., Jenkins P., Wei H., Wu F., Li Z.",10.1145/3308558.3313704

Methods include time series and hot spot analysis, linear regression, elastic-net, Support vector machines SVM with radial and linear kernels, decision tree, bagged CART, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting. Machine learning methods reveal that linear models perform better on our data (linear regression, elastic-net), specifying that a higher number of subway entrances, graffiti, and restaurants on streets contribute to higher theft rates from motor vehicles. Although the prediction model for thefts meets almost all assumptions (five of six), its accuracy is 77%, suggesting that there are other undiscovered factors making a contribution to the generation of thefts.

371,26.0,2019,Article,Quantifying the effects of urban form on land surface temperature in subtropical high-density urban areas using machine learning,"It is widely acknowledged that urban form significantly affects urban thermal environment, which is a key element to adapt and mitigate extreme high temperature weather in high-density urban areas. However, few studies have discussed the impact of physical urban form features on the land surface temperature (LST) from a perspective of comprehensive urban spatial structures. This study used the ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and random forest regression (RF) to distinguish the relative contributions of urban form metrics on LST at three observation scales. Results of this study indicate that more than 90% of the LST variations were explained by selected urban form metrics using RF. Effects of the magnitude and direction of urban form metrics on LST varied with the changes of seasons and observation scales. Overall, building morphology and urban ecological infrastructure had dominant effects on LST variations in high-density urban centers. Urban green space and water bodies demonstrated stronger cooling effects, especially in summer. Building density (BD) exhibited significant positive effects on LST, whereas the floor area ratio (FAR) showed a negative influence on LST. The results can be applied to investigate and implement urban thermal environment mitigation planning for city managers and planners. © 2019 by the authors.",Land surface temperature; Ordinary least-squares regression; Random forest regression; Urban form,"Sun Y., Gao C., Li J., Wang R., Liu J.",10.3390/rs11080924
372,45.0,2019,Article,Turning down the heat: An enhanced understanding of the relationship between urban vegetation and surface temperature at the city scale,"Guiding urban planners on the cooling returns of different configurations of urban vegetation is important to protect urban dwellers from adverse heat impacts. To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km 2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 °C (5 °C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales. © 2018",Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Land surface temperature (LST); Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban vegetation,"Duncan J.M.A., Boruff B., Saunders A., Sun Q., Hurley J., Amati M.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.223
377,8.0,2019,Conference Paper,Comparison of ANN Classifier to the Neuro-Fuzzy System for Collusion Detection in the Tender Procedures of Road Construction Sector,"As the contracts in the road construction sector in Poland are usually of extremely high value and financed from the state budget, the tender procedures should not allow for the non-concurrent behaviours of tender participants. Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed. The created tool can be applied for the future tender procedures as a pre-test of a collusion appearance. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Anysz H., Foremny A., Kulejewski J.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/11/112064

Conventional approaches to control energy efficiency of buildings mainly focus on materials and capacity of insulation, but rarely consider urban and building geometries. By examining energy impacts on urban blocks by urban geometric forms, this paper seeks to identify urban geometric types and energy patterns on urban blocks. To achieve the aims of this study, this paper follows two steps: First, significant indicators for analyzing energy performance are identified in urban geometries; second, the types that capture urban geometry of a real city are categorized. As a result, as a reference for urban planning and design, the paper identifies 13 types that represent the characteristics of urban geometries regarding energy performance. The geometric indicators are carefully measured and their significance to energy performance of buildings is examined through regression analysis. According to these indicators, the 13 types are categorized using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, a machine learning method. Additionally, the 13 types are discussed for implementation as references in urban planning and design, particularly in block planning for a city. © 2018 International Energy Initiative",Cluster analysis; Energy; Typology; Urban block; Urban form; Urban geometry,"Oh M., Kim Y.",10.1016/j.esd.2018.12.002
380,147.0,2019,Article,Urban flood risk mapping using the GARP and QUEST models: A comparative study of machine learning techniques,"Flood risk mapping and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Data-mining; FANP; Flood risk management; GIS; Urban planning,"Darabi H., Choubin B., Rahmati O., Torabi Haghighi A., Pradhan B., Kløve B.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.002

Apart from signal processing, four machine learning techniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and clustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between the participants’ physiological responses and environmental conditions.

It is therefore important to take advantage of available infrastructures to maximize the information extraction for each technology. Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services. Furthermore, the resulting annotations pave the way for building a historical vehicle counting dataset to be used for analysing the impact of road traffic on many city-related issues such as urban planning, security, and pollution. © 2018 IEEE.",Monitoring; Object detection; Regression; Smart cities; Time series; Traffic; Transport,"Rajotte J.-F., Sotir M., Noiseux C., Noel L.-P., Bertiere T.",10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00194
386,24.0,2019,Article,A reduced order model for turbulent flows in the urban environment using machine learning,"To help create a comfortable and healthy indoor and outdoor environment in which to live, there is a need to understand turbulent air flows within the urban environment. To this end, building on a previously reported method [1], we develop a fast-running Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Model (NIROM) for predicting the turbulent air flows found within an urban environment. To resolve larger scale turbulent fluctuations, we employ a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and solve the resulting computational model on unstructured meshes. The objective is to construct a rapid-running NIROM from these results that will have ‘similar’ dynamics to the original LES model. Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and machine learning techniques, this Reduced Order Model (ROM) is six orders of magnitude faster than the high-fidelity LES model and we demonstrate how ‘similar’ it can be to the high-fidelity model by comparing statistical quantities such as the mean flows, Reynolds stresses and probability densities of the velocities. We also include validation of the high-fidelity model against data from wind tunnel experiments. This paper represents a key step towards the use of reduced order modelling for operational purposes with the tantalising possibility of it being used in place of Gaussian plume models, and the potential for greatly improved model fidelity and confidence. © 2018",Gaussian process regression; Machine learning; Non-intrusive reduced order modelling; Operational modelling; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Urban flows,"Xiao D., Heaney C.E., Mottet L., Fang F., Lin W., Navon I.M., Guo Y., Matar O.K., Robins A.G., Pain C.C.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.035
390,,2019,Conference Paper,Variational beauty of space: Machine intuition and non-linear neural aggregations,"Spatial networks have long been known for their internal spatial order or beauty (Hillier, 2007) and in the field spatial computation and analytics we employ a number of graph based methodologies in order to understand or extract intrinsic attributes of the urban fabric around us. In this research we take a complete different approach by looking at urban structure through the use of deep convolutional variational autoencoders with interesting results. Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique in which we employ neural networks for the task of representation learning. Specifically, a neural network architecture imposes a bottleneck in the network which forces a compressed and generalization of the knowledge representation of the structure of space. This non-linear compression and subsequent reconstruction creates a unique set of features that are inherent of urban space. Our network is multiple layers deep in order to be able to encode basic spatial complexity and is build based on a convolutional network architecture which is inspired by biological processes similar to the connectivity pattern between neurons that resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Artificial neurons respond to real urban networks of London in a restricted region of the visual field, which partially overlap such that they cover the entire convolutional visual field. Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. Each convolutional neuron processes data only for its receptive field but the cascading nature of our network build a knowledge of more complex spatial relations as data move deeper. While convolutional neural networks are extensively used in supervised image classification the work presented in this papers is completely unsupervised. In this paper we present the complete architecture of the deep convolutional network that was trained for months using data from the city of London, concluding with two significant outcomes extracted from the variational encoding and decoding processes. A non-linear clustering, or neural aggregation, of urban space based on the learned features and a generative urban network output based on the variational synthesis we call machine intuition. © 2019 Beijing JiaoTong University.

Advertising and information signs on building façades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on façades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of façade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building façades.

This paper shows that different artificial intelligence techniques can be combined to provide the commander with various form of intelligence augmentation and to support the decision making process. A warfare model has been developed where an AI system, representing a red unit, learns how to select the position for a target and for several improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in order to prevent the blue unit to locate the target. The blue unit is trained to reach the target by using deep reinforcement learning, while an evolutionary algorithm is used to train the red unit. These techniques do not rely on large amounts of historical data. Different approaches have been used and discussed to optimise the co-learning of the two agents, showing that optimal behaviour can be learned in an urban environment. Information about the most likely positions of the target and the IEDs can be extracted from the policy learned by the system, and used by the commander to provide intelligence augmentation while planning an operation and evaluating different possible courses of action. The reliability of this information depends on the realism of the AI system simulating the red unit, that is strictly dependent on the model used for the blue unit during the training. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Conventional LOS/MP/NLOS classifiers, referred to as national marine electronics association (NMEA)-level and receiver independent exchange format (RINEX)-level classifiers, are usually performed using attributes extracted from basic observables or measurements such as received signal strength, satellite elevation angle, code pseudorange, etc. The NMEA/RINEX-level classification rate is limited because the complex signal propagation in urban environment is not fully manifested in these end attributes. In this paper, LOS/MP/NLOS features were extracted at the baseband signal processing stage. Multicorrelator is implemented in a GPS software-defined receiver (SDR) and exploited to generate features from the autocorrelation function (ACF). A robust LOS/MP/NLOS classifier using a supervised machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), is then trained. It is also proposed that the Skymask and code pseudorange double difference observable are used to label the real signal type. Raw GPS intermediate frequency data were collected in urban areas in Hong Kong and were postprocessed using a self-developed SDR, which can easily output correlator-level LOS/MP/NLOS features. The SDR measurements were saved in the file with the format of NMEA and RINEX. A fair comparison among NMEA-, RINEX-, and correlator-level classifiers was then carried out on a common ground. Results show that the correlator-level classifier improves the metric of F1 score by about 25% over the conventional NMEA- and RINEX-level classifiers for testing data collected at different places to that of training data. In addition to this finding, correlator-level classifier is found to be more feasible in practical applications due to its less dependency on surrounding scenarios compared with theNMEA/RINEX-level classifiers. © 2019 by the authors.",Global positioning system (GPS); Multipath; Non-line-of-sight (NLOS); Signal classification; Software-defined receiver (SDR); Support vector machine (SVM); Urban environment,"Xu B., Jia Q., Luo Y., Hsu L.-T.",10.3390/rs11161851

The Pampulha region in Belo Horizonte, Brazil was first put through a multi-criteria spatial evaluation with respect to a set of spatial data considered relevant for liveability and quality of life in cities, and was subsequently assessed in terms of perceived walkability (using a machine learning procedure of a training set provided by local auditors). The two types of analysis were compared and qualitatively aggregated to obtain a joint spatial score of the urban environment.

406,35.0,2019,Article,Upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions,"Non-technical summary Manhattan, Berlin and New Delhi all need to take action to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions.

408,2.0,2019,Book Chapter,A multiscale clustering of the urban morphology for use in quantitative models,"Geo-spatial data available to researchers and practitioners has increased substantially over the last decades, offering new opportunities for analyzing and characterizing locations and their spatial environment in an objective way. Various studies in the field of urban planning and design have given recommendations on “good urban form”, suggesting that especially characteristics of the urban morphology inform the quality of locations and additionally influence spatial behavior. While we find a growing number of quantitative spatial models such as hedonic price models, location choice models, or applied machine learning algorithms, characteristics describing the urban morphology are still rarely reported in these. One reason can be found in the limited knowledge on how to characterize the urban morphology best. In this chapter, we address this deficit and define attributes that are suitable to characterize the urban morphology in quantitative means at different scales. We show how these can be processed from a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in most study areas and process them for the case study of Switzerland. Finally, we use the attributes to define urban typologies through clustering methods. These are compared on their outcome, their consistency, and interpretation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Schirmer P.M., Axhausen K.W.",10.1007/978-3-030-12381-9_16
409,11.0,2019,Conference Paper,"Generative design and performance modeling for relationships between urban built forms, sky opening, solar radiation and energy","For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

413,10.0,2019,Article,Mapping long-term dynamics of population and dwellings based on a multi-temporal analysis of urban morphologies,"Information on the distribution and dynamics of dwellings and their inhabitants is essential to support decision-making in various fields such as energy provision, land use planning, risk assessment and disaster management. However, as various different of approaches to estimate the current distribution of population and dwellings exists, further evidence on past dynamics is needed for a better understanding of urban processes. This article therefore addresses the question of whether and how accurately historical distributions of dwellings and inhabitants can be reconstructed with commonly available geodata from national mapping and cadastral agencies. For this purpose, an approach for the automatic derivation of such information is presented. The data basis is constituted by a current digital landscape model and a 3D building model combined with historical land use information automatically extracted from historical topographic maps. For this purpose, methods of image processing, machine learning, change detection and dasymetric mapping are applied. The results for a study area in Germany show that it is possible to automatically derive decadal historical patterns of population and dwellings from 1950 to 2011 at the level of a 100 m grid with slight underestimations and acceptable standard deviations. By a differentiated analysis we were able to quantify the errors for different urban structure types. © 2018 by the authors.",Dasymetric mapping; Dwelling units; Dynamics; Estimation; Historical demography; Multi-temporal; Population; Topographic maps; Urban morphology; Urban planning,"Hecht R., Herold H., Behnisch M., Jehling M.",10.3390/ijgi8010002
414,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,Automating layout synthesis with constructive preference elicitation,"Layout synthesis refers to the problem of arranging objects subject to design preferences and structural constraints. Applications include furniture arrangement, space partitioning (e.g. subdividing a house into rooms), urban planning, and other design tasks. Computer-aided support systems are essential tools for architects and designers to produce custom, functional layouts. Existing systems, however, do not learn the designer’s preferences, and therefore fail to generalize across sessions or instances. We propose addressing layout synthesis by casting it as a constructive preference elicitation task. Our solution employs a coactive interaction protocol, whereby the system and the designer interact by mutually improving each other’s proposals. The system iteratively recommends layouts to the user, and learns the user’s preferences by observing her improvements to the recommendations. We apply our system to two design tasks, furniture arrangement and space partitioning, and report promising quantitative and qualitative results on both.

421,,2018,Conference Paper,"Using particle swarm optimization method to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation in Beijing, China","Agricultural afforestation is an important way to mitigate climate change and improve the environmental quality of city system. The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity. This research highlights the application of machine learning at the high level of smart city management to improve the efficacy and intelligence of urban planning. © 2018 IEEE.",Agricultural Afforestation; Beijing; Carbon sequestration; Particle Swarm Optimization; Urban planning,"Yao J., Kong X., Lal R.",10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00348
424,4.0,2018,Conference Paper,Structural health monitoring installation scheme using utility computing model,"In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena, there is a pressing need for an efficient environment logging that provides structural information to administrators for a better management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility model for structural health monitoring that would enable early detection of risk factors and mitigation of loss. The proposed utility computing model takes the input data in terms of 'number of occupants' in a building (i.e. MAC, International Mobile Equipment Identifier addresses and biometric attendance system installed) and SHM system data (i.e. sensors readings). It give visual representation of all the data for utility managers and experts to decide better location of SHM and number of SHM needed per zone depending on high disturbances created due to higher occupancy and number of structures per zone. Denser area with higher structures and higher population will require more precise and accurate SHM systems compared to rural areas. It also analyzes the data from SHM system and using simple machine learning algorithm give experts' suggestions for type of SHM needed at an area. It make it possible for the data of each and every device of SHM systems over several zones to be accessible by specific authorities that can be used to predict as well as forecast any natural disaster. The Structural Health Monitoring utility model is unique in terms of its heterogeneity of resource management in realizing the utility processes. Finally, a case study of Qatar University is looked at where nodes are distributed in zones along with occupant measuring is used over each building. The data was taken over simulated occupation models and mathematical models from literature for occupation and zone calculation using ideal SHM system data. It can be inferred from the data that real-time analysis data will act similar to simulated and proposed Utility Computing System will give visual data and analyze the zones as can be seen in the results. Therefore, SHM Utility Computing model is efficient and most effective system that save cost as well as prepare authorities for maintenance of a structure or crisis management due to external surroundings. © 2018 IEEE.",Geographical Area Network (GAN); Internet of Things (IoT); Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Things as a Service (TaaS); Utility Computing,"Tariq H., Al-Hitmi M.A.E., Tahir A., Crescini D., Touati F., Manouer A.B.",10.1109/EECS.2018.00019

To integrate the findings of the urban heat islands research into the planning practice, the relationship between land surface temperatures and urban physical and socioeconomic characteristics should be addressed at the planning relevant spatial scale, a land parcel. Using a parcel as a unit of analysis, this study proposed to use a machine learning approach to identify important variables in the formation of urban heat islands in Indianapolis, Indiana. Applying random forest method to planning zones, this study identified planning zone specific urban physical and socioeconomic characteristics that are important for the interpretation of urban heat islands phenomenon of Indianapolis, Indiana. The main contribution of this study is twofold: to integrate urban physical and socioeconomic characteristics into a land parcel for the better interpretation of the result of urban heat islands study into planning practice and to apply machine learning approach to identify highly determinant variables in the formation of urban heat islands. © 2018, The Author(s).",Biophysical vulnerability; Machine learning; Random forest; Socioeconomic vulnerability; Urban heat island effect; Variable selection,Yoo S.,10.1186/s40537-018-0113-z

441,72.0,2018,Article,Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S): A framework for integrating engineering simulation and machine learning methods in a multi-scale urban energy modeling workflow,"The world is rapidly urbanizing, and the energy intensive built environment is becoming increasingly responsible for the world's energy consumption and associated environmental emissions. As a result, significant efforts have been put forth to develop methods that can accurately model and characterize building energy consumption in cities. These models aim to utilize physics-based building energy simulations, reduced-order calculations and statistical learning methods to assess the energy performance of buildings within a dense urban area. However, current urban building energy models are limited in their ability to account for the inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors that can have a substantial impact on building energy use. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S) framework that integrates a network-based machine learning algorithm (ResNet) with engineering simulation to better understand how buildings consume energy on multiple temporal (hourly, daily, monthly) and spatial scales in a city (single building, block, urban). We validate the proposed DUE-S framework on a proof of concept case study of 22 densely located university buildings in California, USA. Our results indicate that the DUE-S framework is able to accurately predict urban scale energy consumption at hourly, daily and monthly intervals. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the integration of data-driven and engineering simulation approaches can partially capture the inter-building energy dynamics and impacts of the urban context and merits future work to explore how they can be improved to predict sub-urban scale energy predictions (single building, block). In the end, successfully predicting and modeling the energy performance of urban buildings has the potential to inform the decision-making of a wide variety of urban sustainability stakeholders including architects, engineers and policymakers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Building energy; Data-driven; Machine learning; Multi-scale; Simulation; Urban context; Urban energy modeling,"Nutkiewicz A., Yang Z., Jain R.K.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.05.023
442,6.0,2018,Conference Paper,Comparison of Regression Tools for Regional Electric Load Forecasting,"Urban area electrical load forecasting is important for power generation capacity planning and also to integrate environment friendly energy sources at district level. Load predictions will help in developing demand side management in coordination with renewable power generation. Urban area load is influenced by meteorological conditions therefore it is important to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting. This paper explores the use of regression tool for regional electric load forecasting by correlating lower distinctive categorical level (season and day of the week) and weather parameters. The historical electrical load datasets with meteorological parameters are available for the Sydney region and they have been used to test the regression tools. Data correlation over seasonal changes have been argued by means of improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE). By examining the structure of various regressors they are compared for the lowest MAPE. The regressors show good MAPE for short term (30 min) prediction and Random Forest Regressor scores best in the range of 1-2 % MAPE. © 2018 University of Split, FESB.",Electric Load Forecasting; k-NN; Machine Learning; Regression Tools,"Johannesen N.J., Kolhe M., Goodwin M.",

Citizens are likely to evaluate the quality of the neighborhood and make important decisions by their perceptions and the feedback from the environment. In this paper, we studied the correlation between the neighborhood's environment with their properties values and land values. It is profitable to train the algorithm by parallel deep convolutional neural networks on the visual urban scenes data associated with quantitative non-visual urban characteristics in the same views. The result of our approach defines a scenarized profile from building-level details to city-level traits. The main contribution of this work is providing a unique and more accurate perspective to urban valuation estimations, by integrating the scattered sources of pieces of information and implanting into the available images.

446,3.0,2018,Conference Paper,Field Experiment of Localization Based on Machine Learning in LTE Network,"In mobile communications networks, if we can estimate the location of each user equipment (UE) with high accuracy, efficient cell planning and network optimization become possible. However, it is difficult for operators to estimate the location of most commercial UEs because they cannot feedback their location information directly to their serving base stations with the exception of UEs with Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) functions specified in LTE Release 10. Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprint method is known as an effective localization method, with which we can estimate the location of UEs with only RF signature and location information beforehand. In LTE, RF fingerprint database can be collected by conducting drive tests or using measurement data from UEs compatible with MDT. Although the estimation accuracy can be better with more RF signatures, the increase in the amount of RF signatures causes the increase in the feedback, which consumes the uplink capacity and UE battery. Furthermore, keeping all RF signatures in database is inefficient because some RF signatures do not have effect on improving estimation accuracy. Hence, it is important to clarify the effect of each RF signature and use only effective ones in the localization. In this paper, we conducted a field experiment to create an RF fingerprint database in dense urban area, and evaluated the effectiveness of each RF signature by making several localization models based on machine learning. Eventually, we clarified minimum RF signatures required to operate RF fingerprint localization in LTE network. © 2018 IEEE.",Localization; LTE; Machine Learning; RF fingerprint,"Kanazawa N., Nagate A., Yamamoto A.",10.1109/VTCFall.2018.8690868
447,25.0,2018,Article,"Using a gradient boosting model to improve the performance of low-cost aerosol monitors in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment","The increased availability and improved quality of new sensing technologies have catalyzed a growing body of research to evaluate and leverage these tools in order to quantify and describe urban environments. Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R2 = 0.36–0.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R2 = 0.68–0.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Air quality; Calibration; Low-cost sensing; Machine learning; Urban,"Johnson N.E., Bonczak B., Kontokosta C.E.",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.019

The integration takes advantage of the robust clustering ability of WKNN and implements a neural network that could estimate the position within each cluster. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach in two urban environments and one rural environment, achieving a mean distance localization error of 5.9 m and 5.1 m in the urban environments and 8.7 m in the rural environment.

Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of large numbers of photographs is time consuming. This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm – Google Cloud Vision – to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20% of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Recreation; Recreational ecosystem services; Singapore; Urban ecology,"Richards D.R., Tunçer B., Tunçer B.",10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.09.004
453,13.0,2018,Article,Development of an urban high-resolution air temperature forecast system for localweather information services based on statistical downscaling,"The Korean peninsula has complex and diverse weather phenomena, and the Korea Meteorological Administration has been working on various numerical models to produce better forecasting data. The Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System is a limited-area working model with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km for estimating local-scale weather forecasts on the Korean peninsula. However, in order to numerically predict the detailed temperature characteristics of the urban space, in which surface characteristics change rapidly in a small spatial area, a city temperature prediction model with higher resolution spatial decomposition capabilities is required. As an alternative to this, a building-scale temperature model was developed, and a 25 m air temperature resolution was determined for the Seoul area. The spatial information was processed using statistical methods, such as linear regression models and machine learning. By comparing the accuracy of the estimated air temperatures with observational data during the summer, the machine learning was improved. In addition, horizontal and vertical characteristics of the urban space were better represented, and the air temperature was better resolved spatially.

454,48.0,2018,Article,The effect of multi-dimensional indicators on urban thermal conditions,"Urban heat island (UHI) studies have recognized ten factors as increasing the inner-city temperature compared with that of the surrounding suburbs. The UHI effect is a leading cause of heat-related diseases and mortality in many nations. However, there are still two main shortcomings. First, the effect of UHI is not well recognized in arid and semi-arid regions. Second, the association of multi-dimensional information with surface temperature in urban areas must be examined. This study focuses on the height-related aspects of urban geometry in an arid region. A range of multispectral and spatial vector data were used to derive the surface temperature and two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) information of the study area. All information was aggregated into a grid with common spatial resolution to create a homogeneous dataset. The machine learning statistical model of a boosted regression tree (BRT) was used to reflect the relative influence of 2D and 3D indicators with land surface temperature. Our results showed a cooler surface temperature in the city than in the surrounding area, leading to the question of whether the established UHI definition encompasses all types of cities. In addition, the thermal band was able to distinguish different spatial structures in the study area. The BRT analysis demonstrated that both multi-dimensional 2D and 3D indicators affect the surface temperature. In particular, the 3D indicators play a more important role than 2D indicators in shaping the surface temperature at different urban geometries of the study area. This new method can help urban planners identify the most influential 2D and 3D indicators that affect the surface temperature in different districts of a city. © 2017",3D modeling; Boosted regression tree analysis; Building shadows; Urban ecology; Urban heat island; Urban morphology,"Alavipanah S., Schreyer J., Haase D., Lakes T., Qureshi S.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.187

In particular, we built machine learning classifiers to predict the class of a location where each class corresponds to a set of locations having equal aesthetic rating. These models are trained on two empirically build datasets containing locations in two different cities (Rome and Paris) where aesthetic ratings of locations were gathered from TripAdvisor.com. In this work we exploit the idea that in a location with higher aesthetic rating, it is more likely for an user to capture a photo and other users are more likely to interact with that photo. Our models achieved as high as 79.48% accuracy (78.60% precision and 79.27% recall) on Rome dataset and 73.78% accuracy(75.62% precision and 78.07% recall) on Paris dataset.

456,60.0,2018,Article,Estimation of daily maximum and minimum air temperatures in urban landscapes using MODIS time series satellite data,"Urban air temperature is considered a significant variable for a variety of urban issues, and analyzing the spatial patterns of air temperature is important for urban planning and management. However, insufficient weather stations limit accurate spatial representation of temperature within a heterogeneous city. This study used a random forest machine learning approach to estimate daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin) for two megacities with different climate characteristics: Los Angeles, USA, and Seoul, South Korea. This study used eight time-series land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with seven auxiliary variables: elevation, solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index, latitude, longitude, aspect, and the percentage of impervious area. We found different relationships between the eight time-series LSTs with Tmax/Tmin for the two cities, and designed eight schemes with different input LST variables. The schemes were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 10-fold cross-validation. The best schemes produced R2 of 0.850 and 0.777 and RMSE of 1.7 °C and 1.2 °C for Tmax and Tmin in Los Angeles, and R2 of 0.728 and 0.767 and RMSE of 1.1 °C and 1.2 °C for Tmax and Tmin in Seoul, respectively. LSTs obtained the day before were crucial for estimating daily urban air temperature. Estimated air temperature patterns showed that Tmax was highly dependent on the geographic factors (e.g., sea breeze, mountains) of the two cities, while Tmin showed marginally distinct temperature differences between built-up and vegetated areas in the two cities. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

465,2.0,2018,Conference Paper,Machine learning for real-time urban metrics and design recommendations,"Cities are growing, becoming more complex, and changing rapidly. Currently, community engagement for urban decision-making is often ineffective, uninformed, and only occurs in projects’ later stages. To facilitate a more collaborative and evidence-based urban decision-making process for both experts and non-experts, real-time feedback and optimized suggestions are essential. However, most of the current tools for urban planning are neither capable of performing complex simulations in real-time nor of providing guidance for better urban performance. CityMatrix was introduced to address these challenges. Machine learning techniques were applied to achieve real-time prediction of multiple urban simulations, and thousands of city configurations were simulated. The simulation results were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the traffic and solar performance of unseen city configurations. The prediction with the CNN is thousands of times faster than the original simulations and maintains a high-quality representation of the results. This machine learning approach was applied as a versatile, quick, accurate, and computationally efficient method not only for real-time feedback, but also for optimized design recommendations. Users involved in the evaluation of this project had a better understanding of the embodied trade-offs of the city and achieved their goals in an efficient manner. © CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

470,,2018,Conference Paper,Investigating Customer Satisfaction Patterns in a Community Livability Context: An Efficiency-Oriented Decision-Making Approach,"A comprehensive understanding of neighborhood facilities distribution and functions along with residential quality of life satisfaction is a key asset for relating livability management to transportation networks. Due to the simultaneous involvement of varied factors with an individual's perception of livability, this concept is difficult to measure. Therefore, a more objective means of quantifying livability is needed. The service industry has demonstrated the intersection of machine learning classifiers and survey domain knowledge for evaluating users' quality of experiences; however, this process of inquiry-based learning has never been considered for solving the communication difficulties between community stakeholders and transportation agencies. Another area of overlap is that of urban computing, which integrates computing technology in the traditional context of urban areas, connecting ubiquitous sensing technologies, computational power, and data about the urban environment to promote quality of life for people living in a particular community. To this aim, the focus of this study is on interpreting a linkage between society stated preferences and quantitative measures of livability by extracting information from survey-based methods and translating it to a quantitative framework using combined service industry and urban computing methodologies. This work focuses on four transportation planning-related research questions in this blended framework: understanding existing livability patterns, predicting heterogeneous perceptions of quality of life, prioritizing public preferences, and developing a multidimensional livability index (MLI). © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Sarram G., Ivey S.S.",10.1061/9780784481561.019

To realize reliable UAV communications, a fundamental work is to investigate the propagation characteristics of the channels. In this paper, we propose path loss models for the UAV air-to-air (AA) scenario based on machine learning. A ray-tracing software is employed to generate samples for multiple routes in a typical urban environment, and different altitudes of Tx and Rx UAVs are taken into consideration. Two machine-learning algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, are exploited to build prediction models on the basis of the training data. The prediction performance of trained models is assessed on the test set according to the metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, two empirical models are presented for comparison. It is shown that the machine-learning-based models are able to provide high prediction accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency in the AA scenario. Moreover, Random Forest outperforms other models and has the smallest prediction errors. Further investigation is made to evaluate the impacts of five different parameters on the path loss. It is demonstrated that the path visibility is crucial for the path loss. © 2018 Yan Zhang et al.",,"Zhang Y., Wen J., Yang G., He Z., Luo X.",10.1155/2018/8489326
480,,2017,Conference Paper,Localization Decisions of Entrepreneurs: The Role of Path Dependency and Market Forces,"The purpose of this research is to determine the role of path dependency and market forces in the localization decisions of entrepreneurs from different industries. We hypothesize that most industries develop new entities based on the number of companies from the same industry that already exist in a region. We also hypothesize that entrepreneurs create new entities based on related industries operating within the same knowledge pool. To test these hypotheses, we used the machine learning decision tree method. The input variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland in 2009. The target values are the number of new companies from these industries created in the years 2009-2015. The principal results show that localization decisions are mostly based on demand and supply industries, in which manufacturing industries play crucial role. Path dependency appears in less than half of the industries' models and thus is not the main factor influencing decisions regarding the creation of new companies. The highest share of path-dependent industries is in manufacturing sector, but the degree of the dependence is lower than in the service sector. The service sector seems to be the least path-dependent, as services usually serve other industries. Competition in industries is a rare factor in new company creation; however, if it appears, it usually shrinks the industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Pylak K., Majerek D.",10.1088/1757-899X/245/6/062025

The computational experiment was held using the backward propagation of errors method of training the artificial neural network, which was trained based on the geometry of the details of the Roman Corinthian order capital. During the experiment, as an input training data set, five local geometry parameters combined has given the best results: Theta, Pi, Rho in spherical coordinate system based on the capital volume centroid, followed by Z value of the Cartesian coordinate system and a distance from vertical planes created based on the capital symmetry. Additionally during the experiment, artificial neural network hidden layers optimal count and structure was found, giving results of the error below 0.2% for the mentioned before input parameters. Once successfully trained artificial network, was able to mimic the details composition on any other geometry type given. Despite of calculating the transformed geometry locally and separately for each of the thousands of surface points, system could create visually attractive and diverse, complex patterns. Designed tool, based on the supervised learning method of machine learning, gives possibility of generating new architectural forms- free of the designer's imagination bounds.

482,38.0,2017,Article,Building block level urban land-use information retrieval based on Google Street View images,"Land-use maps are important references for urban planning and urban studies. Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the façades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their façade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",GSV (Google Street View); image features; machine learning; urban land-use mapping,"Li X., Zhang C., Li W.",10.1080/15481603.2017.1338389

Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land use and urban form classification based on these metrics. Our study points out the shortcomings of traditional landscape ecological metrics for mapping urban form and emphasizes the need for alternative approaches for analysing urban landscapes, more explicitly describing the morphological characteristics of the urban fabric. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brussels Capital Region; Land use; Machine learning; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Urban function,"Vanderhaegen S., Canters F.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.023

Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify.

495,,2017,Article,Multi-scale modeling of territorial dynamics of geospatial anthropogenic energy consumption,"Objective: The development of any region or territory stems from its own dynamic nature. Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the development of a new dynamic-based power market design. © 2017 The Authors.",Computational modeling; Geographic information systems; Machine learning-based data analysis,"Rai A., Jagadeesh Kannan R.",10.22159/ajpcr.2017.v10s1.19744

Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people׳s reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard. In addition, this forecasting approach can provide decision support for smog-related health hazard management through functions like early warning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Data mining; Forecasting; Health hazard; Smog disaster; Social media; Urban data,"Chen J., Chen H., Wu Z., Hu D., Pan J.Z.",10.1016/j.is.2016.03.011

The flow field around the building was simulated using the CFD model under different wind speeds and directions. Results from CFD simulation could be well presented in GIS using anchored coordinate system. The flow patterns were very similar when the wind speed was varied, while they were highly dependent on the wind directions. However, predicting the flow fields of different wind directions requires running the CFD simulation for each case. A neural network for machine learning was adopted to help predict the microclimate around the building so that much time can be saved. The results show that the proposed neural network has the potential to help predict the microclimate.

506,9.0,2017,Conference Paper,NLOS multipath detection by using machine learning in urban environments,"In global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning, GNSS satellites are often obstructed by buildings, leading to reflected and diffracted signals, which are known as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. These cause major positioning (also known as ""NLOS multipath"") errors in GNSS positioning. This paper proposes a novel NLOS multipath detection technique that uses a machine-learning technique to improve positioning accuracy in urban environments. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the code-tracking process within GNSS receivers, the code correlation peak is determined and tracked using the outputs of the signal correlators. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to the direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. For realizing machine learning, we extract the features of the NLOS signal from the shape of the NLOS correlation function, using an actual dataset, to construct an NLOS classifier. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conduct NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We propose to construct an NLOS classifier based on a support vector machine. From the experiments, 87% of the LOS signals and 99% of the NLOS signals are correctly discriminated.

It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related. Building-related indicators include building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and traffic-related indicators include traffic volume, speed and percentage of heavy vehicle.

512,6.0,2017,Conference Paper,An Evaluation Index for Cross Ventilation Based on CFD Simulations and Ventilation Prediction Model Using Machine Learning algorithms,"High-density cities usually surfer deterioration of the urban built environment due to slow or stagnant air movement. This deterioration could be mitigated by improved urban natural ventilation through good urban planning and building design. However, indoor natural ventilation requirements in current building standards only define absolute indoor air speed without considering outdoor conditions. To fill this gap, this paper developed generic urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor CFD models and proposes a new integrated index (CIOI index) to evaluate indoor natural ventilation potential, which couples both indoor and outdoor wind environments. CIOIv regression models are developed by applying machine learning algorithms based on 3,840 CFD simulation results. The Gradient Boosting (GB) model shows an improved performance in terms of higher correlation (R2=0.8) and lower errors (MAPE=16%) compared with the multivariate linear regression model.

In this article, I test the hypothesis whether configurational (syntactic) properties of an urban street network are relevant for the location of land use. If syntactic features are relevant, then land use types may have a 'syntactic signature'. To identify this blueprint, I apply machine-learning techniques to datasets of syntactic measures, for ten business types. The results are ten models, each with the syntactic blueprint of a type of business. The models are used to predict the existence, or not, of such businesses in segments of the map of London. The performance of the models varies, with fifty per cent reaching statistical significance, including one with 'good' prediction ability. The models for Starbucks coffee shops and solicitor's offices have the strongest prediction ability. The exploratory exercise demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning method Random Forests, when supervised and individually applied to a business activity, to identify the syntactic signature of business types. Such models can be used during planning and design and on location studies. The results strengthen the candidacy of syntactic measurements to location-decision-making.

Therefore, implementation of landslides susceptibility models is essential in urban planning. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the possible applicability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in landslides susceptibility prediction. We have built a classification problem with two classes, landslides and stable areas, and applied SVMs algorithms in the districts Bytča, Kysucké Nové Mesto and Žilina. A spatial database of landslides areas and geologically stable areas from the State Geological Institute of Dionýz Štúr were used to fit SVMs models. Four environmental input parameters, land use, lithology, aspect and slope were used to train support vector machines models. During the training phase, the primal objective was to find optimal sets of kernel parameters by grid search. The linear, polynomial and radial basis function kernels were computed. Together 534 models were trained and tested with LIBLINEAR and LIBSVM libraries. Models were evaluated by Accuracy parameter. Then the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and landslides susceptibility maps were produced for the best model for every kernel. The best predictive performance was gained by radial basis function kernel. This kernel has also the best generalization ability.

517,112.0,2017,Article,A data-driven predictive model of city-scale energy use in buildings,"Many cities across the United States have turned to building energy disclosure (or benchmarking) laws to encourage transparency in energy efficiency markets and to support sustainability and carbon reduction plans. In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1 million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2 kbtu/sf and for residential buildings is 31.2 kbtu/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings – those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall – are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Building energy; Energy efficiency; Energy prediction; Machine learning; Urban dynamics,"Kontokosta C.E., Tull C.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.005
518,6.0,2016,Conference Paper,Machine learning for source localization in urban environments,"This paper investigates source localization in urban environments using machine learning methods. Both classification and regression schemes are examined using the random forest algorithm. In both approaches, the localization performance depends mostly on arrival time information of received signals. It is shown that the use of a relative arrival time difference rather than the direct time of arrival (TOA) also provide good performance, which is beneficial for practical application. It is found that with enough number of receivers, the signal power parameter can be omitted, which eliminates frequency dependency of developed models. It is also found that at least three receivers should be used to achieve acceptable prediction performance. Additionally, the number of training examples needed depends on the approach used as well as the desired level of accuracy. This factor is more important in the classification approach, as the amount of training data required closely relates to the number of sectors created by the localization problem. A regression scheme is more natural for predicting spatial coordinate values, and achieved higher localization accuracy with fewer training examples as compared to classification. Ultimately, the regression based localization scheme using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) parameter at three receiver locations achieved an average localization accuracy of 2.8m. © 2016 IEEE.",Machine learning; ray tracing; source localization; urban environments,"Bibb D.A., Yun Z., Iskander M.F.",10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795360
520,8.0,2016,Article,Thermal sensation prediction by soft computing methodology,"Thermal comfort in open urban areas is very factor based on environmental point of view. Therefore it is need to fulfill demands for suitable thermal comfort during urban planning and design. Thermal comfort can be modeled based on climatic parameters and other factors. The factors are variables and they are changed throughout the year and days. Therefore there is need to establish an algorithm for thermal comfort prediction according to the input variables. The prediction results could be used for planning of time of usage of urban areas. Since it is very nonlinear task, in this investigation was applied soft computing methodology in order to predict the thermal comfort. The main goal was to apply extreme leaning machine (ELM) for forecasting of physiological equivalent temperature (PET) values. Temperature, pressure, wind speed and irradiance were used as inputs. The prediction results are compared with some benchmark models. Based on the results ELM can be used effectively in forecasting of PET. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Extreme leaning machine; PET; Prediction; Thermal comfort; Urban areas,"Jović S., Arsić N., Vilimonović J., Petković D.",10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.005
521,35.0,2016,Article,"Impacts of land use and amenities on public transport use, urban planning and design","Various land-use configurations are known to have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and ""interpretability"". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of ""regional centers"" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Amenities; Land use; Public transit; Urban planning,"Hu N., Legara E.F., Lee K.K., Hung G.G., Monterola C.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.06.004

564,26.0,2014,Article,A tool for urban soundscape evaluation applying Support Vector Machines for developing a soundscape classification model,"To ensure appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines,"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108

In this study, an investigation was performed to classify buildings delineated from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data into three types: single-family houses, multiple-family houses, and non-residential buildings. Four kinds of spatial attributes describing the shape, location, and surrounding environment of buildings were calculated and subsequently employed in the classification. Experiments were performed in suburban and downtown sites in Denver, CO, USA, considering different building components and neighborhood environments. Building type classification results yielded overall accuracy > 70% and Kappa > 0.5 for both sites, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining building type information from LiDAR data. The shape attributes, such as width, footprint area, and perimeter, were most useful for identifying building types. Environmental landscape attributes surrounding buildings, such as the number of road and parking lot pixels, also contributed to obtaining building type information. Combining shape and environmental landscape attributes was necessary to obtain accurate and consistent classification results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Building classification; Decision trees; LiDAR; Machine learning; Random forest; Support vector machines,"Lu Z., Im J., Rhee J., Hodgson M.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.07.005

Currently, urban planners are hindered by a lack of information available in a format suitable for the large-scale analysis of sidewalk design. To demonstrate the impact that information technology could have in this area, we leverage techniques from machine learning and computer vision to gather information about the presence and quality of sidewalks in map images. In particular, we identify sidewalk segments in street view images using a random forest classifier, utilizing a set of local and global features that include geometric context, presence of lanes, pixel color, and location. Our results illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segments in a large set of street view images. This algorithm can be easily extended to other datasets, and can be automated to gather complete, fine-grained details about sidewalks for arbitrarily large urban environments. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Smith V., Malik J., Culler D.",10.1109/IGCC.2013.6604476
577,5.0,2012,Conference Paper,Classification of urban scenes from georeferenced images in urban street-view context,"This paper addresses the challenging problem of scene classification in street-view georeferenced images of urban environments. More precisely, the goal of this task is semantic image classification, consisting in predicting in a given image, the presence or absence of a pre-defined class (e.g. shops, vegetation, etc.). The approach is based on the BOSSA representation, which enriches the Bag of Words (BoW) model, in conjunction with the Spatial Pyramid Matching scheme and kernel-based machine learning techniques. The proposed method handles problems that arise in large scale urban environments due to acquisition conditions (static and dynamic objects/pedestrians) combined with the continuous acquisition of data along the vehicles direction, the varying light conditions and strong occlusions (due to the presence of trees, traffic signs, cars, etc.) giving rise to high intra-class variability. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset of high resolution images collected from two main avenues from the 12th district in Paris and the approach shows promising results. © 2012 IEEE.",kernel-based machine learning; semantic image classification; spatial pyramid matching; street-level images; visual words,"Iovan C., Picard D., Thome N., Cord M.",10.1109/ICMLA.2012.171
579,6.0,2012,Review,Visual gaze analysis of robotic pedestrians moving in urban space,"This study is founded on the idea that an analysis of the visual gaze dynamics of pedestrians can increase our understanding of how important architectural features in urban environments are perceived by pedestrians. The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences. We briefly describe how the obtained multidimensional trajectory data can be analysed by using a temporal behaviour analysis technique based on support vector machines that was developed separately. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",gaze analysis; localization; manifold learning; pedestrians; robots; saliency; tracking,"Wong A.S.W., Chalup S.K., Bhatia S., Jalalian A., Kulk J., Nicklin S., Ostwald M.J.",10.1080/00038628.2012.688013

In this paper, pattern recognition techniques specially designed to automatically recognise soundscapes are implemented. Specifically, the study focuses on finding the most appropriated learning paradigm.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Citizen science; Solitary bees; Spatial distribution; Sun exposure; Trap nest; Urban landscape structure,"Everaars J., Strohbach M.W., Gruber B., Dormann C.F.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.05.008
