7,,2022,Article,Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to Modeling Residential Infill Development in the City of Los Angeles,"While infill development is widely accepted by cities as an alternative to urban sprawl, a very dearth of research has attempted to measure infill development and identify contributing factors to infill development. Filling this research gap, this paper models residential infill development in the City of Los Angeles by employing five machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper attempts to identify the best-performing ML algorithms by comparing the performance of the ML algorithms. Of the five ML algorithms tested, the random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms are selected as the best-performing algorithms. The RF algorithm ranks independent variables from most to least important. Overall, the ranks suggested that residential infill development in the City of Los Angeles is significantly influenced by the physical conditions of property and neighborhood rather than socioeconomic characteristics. Diverse land uses, good housing mixes, and rail transit accessibility also, importantly, contributed to the infill development. This finding suggests that the city's planning efforts, such as the promotion of accessory dwelling unit (ADU) development and the expansion of rail transit, can create a virtuous circle for sustainable urban development. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Kim D., Shim J., Park J., Cho J., Kumar S.",10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000787
15,,2022,Review,Automatic identification of addresses: A systematic literature review,"Address matching continues to play a central role at various levels, through geocoding and data integration from different sources, with a view to promote activities such as urban planning, location-based services, and the construction of databases like those used in census operations. However, the task of address matching continues to face several challenges, such as non-standard or incomplete address records or addresses written in more complex languages. In order to better understand how current limitations can be overcome, this paper conducted a systematic literature review focused on automated approaches to address matching and their evolution across time. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, resulting in a final set of 41 papers published between 2002 and 2021, the great majority of which are after 2017, with Chinese authors leading the way. The main findings revealed a consistent move from more traditional approaches to deep learning methods based on semantics, encoder-decoder architectures, and attention mechanisms, as well as the very recent adoption of hybrid approaches making an increased use of spatial constraints and entities. The adoption of evolutionary-based approaches and privacy preserving methods stand as some of the research gaps to address in future studies. © 2021 by the authors.

34,,2021,Article,Identifying urban built environment factors in pregnancy care and maternal mental health outcomes,"Backgrounds: Risk factors related to the built environment have been associated with women’s mental health and preventive care. This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients’ residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients’ residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Results: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. Conclusions: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD. Findings may inform urban design policies and provide awareness for care providers on the association of patients’ residing neighborhoods and healthy pregnancy. © 2021, The Author(s).",Built environment; Postpartum depression; Pregnancy care,"Zhang Y., Tayarani M., Wang S., Liu Y., Sharma M., Joly R., RoyChoudhury A., Hermann A., Gao O.H., Pathak J.",10.1186/s12884-021-04056-1
43,1.0,2021,Article,An end-to-end point of interest (Poi) conflation framework,"Point of interest (POI) data serves as a valuable source of semantic information for places of interest and has many geospatial applications in real estate, transportation, and urban planning. With the availability of different data sources, POI conflation serves as a valuable technique for enriching data quality and coverage by merging the POI data from multiple sources. This study proposes a novel end-to-end POI conflation framework consisting of six steps, starting with data procurement, schema standardisation, taxonomy mapping, POI matching, POI unification, and data verification. The feasibility of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study conducted in the eastern region of Singapore, where the POI data from five data sources was conflated to form a unified POI dataset. Based on the evaluation conducted, the resulting unified dataset was found to be more comprehensive and complete than any of the five POI data sources alone. Furthermore, the proposed approach for identifying POI matches between different data sources outperformed all baseline approaches with a matching accuracy of 97.6% with an average run time below 3 min when matching over 12,000 POIs to result in 8699 unique POIs, thereby demonstrating the framework’s scalability for large scale implementation in dense urban contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

95,1.0,2021,Article,Urban morphological feature extraction and multi-dimensional similarity analysis based on deep learning approaches,"The study of urban morphology contributes to the evolution of cities and sustainable development. Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots’ figure–ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences. This work could serve as a basis for further typo-morphology studies and other morphology-related ecological, social, and economic studies for sustainable built environments. © 2021 by the authors.

99,1.0,2021,Article,Identifying urban poverty using high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning approaches: Implications for housing inequality,"Enriching Asian perspectives on the rapid identification of urban poverty and its implications for housing inequality, this paper contributes empirical evidence about the utility of image features derived from high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning approaches for identifying urban poverty in China at the community level. For the case of the Jiangxia District and Huangpi District of Wuhan, image features, including perimeter, line segment detector (LSD), Hough transform, gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), histogram of oriented gradients (HoG), and local binary patterns (LBP), are calculated, and four machine learning approaches and 25 variables are applied to identify urban poverty and relatively important variables. The results show that image features and machine learning approaches can be used to identify urban poverty with the best model performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.5341 and 0.5324 for Jiangxia and Huangpi, respectively, although some differences exist among the approaches and study areas. The importance of each variable differs for each approach and study area; however, the relatively important variables are similar. In particular, four variables achieved relatively satisfactory prediction results for all models and presented obvious differences in varying communities with different poverty levels. Housing inequality within low-income neighborhoods, which is a response to gaps in wealth, income, and housing affordability among social groups, is an important manifestation of urban poverty. Policy makers can implement these findings to rapidly identify urban poverty, and the findings have potential applications for addressing housing inequality and proving the rationality of urban planning for building a sustainable society. © 2021 by the authors.

126,2.0,2021,Article,Geosilhouettes: Geographical measures of cluster fit,"Regionalization, under various guises and descriptions, is a longstanding and pervasive interest of urban studies. With an increasingly large number of studies on urban place detection in language, behavior, pricing, and demography, recent critiques of longstanding regional science perspectives on place detection have focused on the arbitrariness and non-geographical nature of measures of best fit. In this paper, we develop new explicitly geographical measures of cluster fit. These hybrid spatial–social measures, called geosilhouettes, are demonstrated to capture the “core” of geographical clusters in racial data on census blocks in Brooklyn neighborhoods. These new geosilhouettes are also useful in a variety of boundary analysis and outlier detection problems. In this paper, the thinking behind geosilhouettes is presented, their mathematical form is defined, they are demonstrated, and new directions of research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.",clustering; Data science; segregation; unsupervised learning; urban sociology,"Wolf L.J., Knaap E., Rey S.",10.1177/2399808319875752

160,,2021,Review,"Reviewing the application of machine learning methods to model urban form indicators in planning decision support systems: Potential, issues and challenges","Modern cities dynamically face several challenges including digitalization, sustainability, resilience and economic development. Urban planners and designers must develop urban forms that address these challenges. With the integration of new communication and information technologies (Smartphone, GIS, Drones, IoT, Sensors, etc.), urban activities have generated large volumes of urban data. The rapid growth in terms of collection and big data storage capacities combined with the ever-increasing computational power of modern machines have made possible their efficient treatment using machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The emergence of such groundbreaking methods has in turn helped to address the challenges of modern-day cities in several domains (health, security, mobility, etc). ML algorithms have been proposed to model the urban form's indicators for intelligent urban planning decision making. They have been proven to perform better than the traditional methods. However, the potential of ML has not yet been fully explored in research for urban planning decision support. This paper presents a comprehensive review of ML applications for mitigating the challenges of modern cities planning. First and foremost, an overview of the urban forms, sources of urban data, the ML and DL techniques as well as their potential in solving the aforementioned challenges. For each ML method, we will highlight it working principle, advantages, disadvantages and potential applications using comparative tables. Finally, we will discuss the issues and challenges of ML methods in urban form's modeling while ultimately advocating some future research directions. © 2021",Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Ensemble methods; Machine learning; Neural networks; Urban big data; Urban data; Urban form; Urban models; Urban planning,"Koumetio Tekouabou S.C., Diop E.B., Azmi R., Jaligot R., Chenal J.",10.1016/j.jksuci.2021.08.007
163,,2021,Conference Paper,Transfer learning-based city similarity measurement: A case study on urban hotel,"With the development of modern cities, multiple types and wide distribution of urban data has been gradually collected. Effectively using urban data to solve city development and planning issues has become a research hot-spot. Currently, the data scale in modern cities is quite different, and the fitting degree of machine learning algorithm based on single city is not mature yet. This paper studies the problem with transfer learning technique, and trains the prediction model of urban hotel development scale using multi-source city data. Based on the location data and related information of 15 different cities, the relevant knowledge is transferred, and a city feature extraction and similarity measurement framework is proposed. © 2021 Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

164,,2021,Article,Machine Learning Predictors for Sustainable Urban Planning,"While essential for economic reasons, rapid urbanization has had many negative impacts on the environment and the social wellbeing of humanity. Heavy traffic, unexpected geohazards are some of the effects of uncontrollable development. This situation points its fingerto urban planning and design; there are numerous automation tools to help urban planners assess and forecast, yet unplanned development still occurs, impeding sustainability. Automation tools use machine learning classification models to analyze spatial data and various trend views before planning a new urban development. Although there are many sophisticated tools and massive datasets, big cities with colossal migration still witness traffic jams, pollution, and environmental degradation affecting urban dwellers’ quality. This study will analyze the current predictors in urban planning machine learning models and identify the suitable predictors to support sustainable urban planning. A correct set of predictors could improve the efficiency of the urban development classification models and help urban planners to enhance the quality of life in big cities. © 2021.

180,,2021,Article,Virtual design of urban planning based on GIS big data and machine learning,"In order to build a virtual urban planning model and improve the effect of urban planning, this paper builds a virtual urban planning design model based on GIS big data technology and machine learning algorithms, and proposes a solution that combines multiple features. With the development of polarized SAR in the direction of high resolution, a single feature often cannot fully express the detailed information of ground objects, resulting in poor classification results and low accuracy. The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score. The research results show that the model constructed in this paper meets the expected goals. © 2021 - IOS Press.

185,1.0,2021,Article,Delineating urban job-housing patterns at a parcel scale with street view imagery,"Empirical data are limited to decipher where people live and work in large cities; however, neighborhood information, such as street view image, is rich and abundant. We construct a ResNet-50-based social detection model to explore the potential relationship between street view images and job-housing attributes. The method extracts street view images of a neighborhood in all eight directions to predict land parcels’ job-housing attributes and uses an entropy index to measure the degree of job-housing mixture in Shenzhen as an example. The social-detection model performs well with a low RMSE (0.1094) in identifying job-housing patterns. The eight-direction neighborhood method shows the best support for sufficient neighborhood information from street view images (RMSE = 0.1135) compared with other neighborhood methods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using street-view images and deep learning to characterize job-housing attributes consistent with findings from urban studies with socioeconomic data; for example, the research finding concurs that Shenzhen has many high job-housing mixtures with very few areas designated for jobs or residences. The proposed method, when applied regularly, can help monitor spatial dynamics of urban job-housing patterns to inform city planning and development. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deep learning; job-housing; socioeconomic characteristics; street view images; Urban spatial structure,"Yao Y., Zhang J., Qian C., Wang Y., Ren S., Yuan Z., Guan Q.",10.1080/13658816.2021.1895170
197,4.0,2021,Article,Remote measurement of building usable floor area – Algorithms fusion,"Rapid changes that are taking place in the urban environment have significant impact on urban growth. Most cities and urban regions all over the world compete to increase resident and visitor satisfaction. The growing requirements and rapidity of introducing new technologies to all aspects of residents’ lives force cities and urban regions to implement “smart cities” concepts in their activities. Real estate is one of the principal anthropogenic components of urban environment thus become a subject of thorough multidisciplinary analysis in the field of data requiring spatial information systems. Recent advances in information technology, combined with the increased availability of high-resolution imagery from Earth observation, create an opportunity to use new sources of data that enable to identify, monitor, and solved many of urban environmental problem. The aim of the paper is to elaborate precise, complete and detailed property information with the use of remote sensing observations in a suitable numerical algorithm. The authors concentrate on providing one of the most important, and probably the most lacking, feature describing properties – building usable floor area (BUFA). The solution is elaborated in the form of an automatic algorithm based on machine learning and computer vision technology related to LiDAR (big data), close range images with respect to spatial information systems requirements. The obtained results related to BUFA estimation in comparison to the state-of-the-art results are satisfactory and may increase the reliability of decision-making in investment, fiscal, registration and planning aspects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Algorithms fusion; Building usable floor area; Computer vision; Fuzzy theory; Machine learning; Measurement data processing,"Janowski A., Renigier-Biłozor M., Walacik M., Chmielewska A.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104938
204,7.0,2020,Article,Using GIS and machine learning to classify residential status of urban buildings in low and middle income settings,"Utilising satellite images for planning and development is becoming a common practice as computational power and machine learning capabilities expand. In this paper, we explore the use of satellite image derived building footprint data to classify the residential status of urban buildings in low and middle income countries. A recently developed ensemble machine learning building classification model is applied for the first time to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to Nigeria. The model is informed by building footprint and label data of greater completeness and attribute consistency than have previously been available for these countries. A GIS workflow is described that semiautomates the preparation of data for input to the model. The workflow is designed to be particularly useful to those who apply the model to additional countries and use input data from diverse sources. Results show that the ensemble model correctly classifies between 85% and 93% of structures as residential and nonresidential across both countries. The classification outputs are likely to be valuable in the modelling of human population distributions, as well as in a range of related applications such as urban planning, resource allocation, and service delivery. © 2020 by the authors.

219,3.0,2020,Article,The shape of segregation: The role of urban form in immigrant assimilation,"The built environment can mediate or constrain the opportunities for social interaction, essential to the formation of social ties. This study uses the large inflow of immigrants in Barcelona between 1998 and 2008 to study whether the configuration of buildings and open urban areas in a block is associated with the residential segregation of immigrants—a proxy for social interaction. Based on a rich set of shape metrics, I use machine learning techniques to classify each block in Barcelona into one of eight typologies, which provide a summary measure of their built environment. I then combine these data with measures of residential segregation constructed at the building level using data on the exact address of each resident of Barcelona. The findings show that some features of the built environment of a block—as measured by the typologies—are systematically associated with reduced residential segregation of Spaniards and newly arrived immigrants in that block. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Machine learning; Segregation; Urban design; Urban form,Salazar Miranda A.,10.1016/j.cities.2020.102852
241,,2020,Article,A deep learning approach to urban street functionality prediction based on centrality measures and stacked denoising autoencoder,"In urban planning and transportation management, the centrality characteristics of urban streets are vital measures to consider. Centrality can help in understanding the structural properties of dense traffic networks that affect both human life and activity in cities. Many cities classify urban streets to provide stakeholders with a group of street guidelines for possible new rehabilitation such as sidewalks, curbs, and setbacks. Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments. In our work, a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) predicts a street's functionality, then logistic regression is used as a classifier. Our proposed classifier can differentiate between four different classes adopted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT): principal arterial road, minor arterial road, collector road, and local road. The SDAE-based model showed that regular grid configurations with repeated patterns are more influential in forming the functionality of road networks compared to those with less regularity in their spatial structure. © 2020 by the authors.

The method is automatic, which relieves the work load from statistical surveys and other inefficient traditional approaches. Moreover, while the surveys can only reflect the current conditions, the machine learning approach has the ability of predicting the possible outcomes based on existing data, which is helpful when decisions on protection and development are to be made.

263,16.0,2020,Article,A deep learning architecture for semantic address matching,"Address matching is a crucial step in geocoding, which plays an important role in urban planning and management. To date, the unprecedented development of location-based services has generated a large amount of unstructured address data. Traditional address matching methods mainly focus on the literal similarity of address records and are therefore not applicable to the unstructured address data. In this study, we introduce an address matching method based on deep learning to identify the semantic similarity between address records. First, we train the word2vec model to transform the address records into their corresponding vector representations. Next, we apply the enhanced sequential inference model (ESIM), a deep text-matching model, to make local and global inferences to determine if two addresses match. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method, we fine-tune the model with real-world address data from the Shenzhen Address Database and compare the outputs with those of several popular address matching methods. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a higher matching accuracy for unstructured address records, with its precision, recall, and F1 score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) reaching 0.97 on the test set. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deep neural network; Geocoding; machine learning; semantic matching; word2vec,"Lin Y., Kang M., Wu Y., Du Q., Liu T.",10.1080/13658816.2019.1681431

Different ways of landscape design can add natural landscape to the urban ecosystem, and will not destroy the ecological environment, but will gradually improve the quality of the ecological environment. However, the design methods of landscape in urban planning in China are not perfect enough, there are many problems, and it is difficult to improve the ecological environment of the city. Therefore, in the process of urban planning, the relevant personnel should fully understand the design methods of landscape, and constantly innovate to create a quality living environment for people. In this paper, we propose the landscape architecture system based on mobile edge streaming media data processing. In the system, video surveillance system is mainly used to collect data, and the edge computing is the further processing of the inner connections. Especially, the stram data is analysed based on the machine learning models and the connection with the design is analysed. The experimental results prove robustness of the methodology.

290,1.0,2020,Article,Uncertainties of human perception in visual image interpretation in complex urban environments,"Today satellite images are mostly exploited automatically due to advances in image classification methods. Manual visual image interpretation (MVII), however, still plays a significant role e.g., to generate training data for machine-learning algorithms or for validation purposes. In certain urban environments, however, of e.g., highest densities and structural complexity, textural and spectral complications in overlapping roof-structures still demand the human interpreter if one aims to capture individual building structures. The cognitive perception and real-world experience are still inevitable. Against these backgrounds, this article aims at quantifying and interpreting the uncertainties of mapping rooftop footprints of such areas. We focus on the agreement among interpreters and which aspects of perception and elements of image interpretation affect mapping. Ten test persons digitized six complex built-up areas. Hereby, we receive quantitative information about spatial variables of buildings to systematically check the consistency and congruence of results. An additional questionnaire reveals qualitative information about obstacles. Generally, we find large differences among interpreters' mapping results and a high consistency of results for the same interpreter. We measure rising deviations correlate with a rising morphologic complexity. High degrees of individuality are expressed e.g., in time consumption, in-situ- or geographic information system (GIS)-precognition whereas data source mostly influences the mapping procedure. By this study, we aim to fill a gap as prior research using MVII often does not implement an uncertainty analysis or quantify mapping aberrations. We conclude that remote sensing studies should not only rely unquestioned on MVII for validation; furthermore, data and methods are needed to suspend uncertainty. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",Cognition; earth observation; elements of image interpretation; level of individual buildings (LoD-1); manual visual image interpretation (MVII); perception; uncertainty; urban morphology,"Kraff N.J., Wurm M., Taubenbock H.",10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3011543
318,16.0,2019,Article,Deprivation pockets through the lens of convolutional neural networks,"Machine learning techniques have been frequently applied to map urban deprivation (commonly referred to as slums) in very high-resolution satellite images. Among these, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown exceptional efficiency in automated deprivation mapping at the local scale. Yet these networks have never been used to map very small heterogeneous deprivation areas (pockets) at large scale. This study proposes and evaluates a U-Net-Compound model to map deprivation pockets in Bangalore, India. The model only relies on RGB satellite images with a resolution of 2 m as these are more commonly accessible to local urban planning departments. The experiment assumes a practical situation where only limited reference data is available for the model to learn the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets. It tests whether an updated map of deprivation pockets can be obtained with limited information. The model performance to map a large number of deprivation pockets is examined by incrementally changing the model architecture and the amount of training data. Results show that the proposed model is sensitive to the amount of spatial information contained in the training data. Once sufficient spatial information is learnt through a few samples, the city scale mapping accuracy outperforms existing models in mapping small deprivation pockets, achieving a Jaccard Index of 54%. This study demonstrated that a well-designed convolutional neural network can map the existence, extent, as well as distribution patterns of deprivation pockets at the city scale with limited training data, which is essential for upscaling research outputs to provide important information for the formulation of pro-poor policies. © 2019",Bangalore; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deprivation pockets; Slums,"Wang J., Kuffer M., Roy D., Pfeffer K.",10.1016/j.rse.2019.111448
365,3.0,2019,Article,Using Random Forests on Real-World City Data for Urban Planning in a Visual Semantic Decision Support System,"The constantly increasing amount and availability of urban data derived from varying sources leads to an assortment of challenges that include, among others, the consolidation, visualization, and maximal exploitation prospects of the aforementioned data. A preeminent problem affecting urban planning is the appropriate choice of location to host a particular activity (either commercial or common welfare service) or the correct use of an existing building or empty space. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these challenges availed with machine learning techniques. The proposed system combines, fuses, and merges various types of data from different sources, encodes them using a novel semantic model that can capture and utilize both low-level geometric information and higher level semantic information and subsequently feeds them to the random forests classifier, as well as other supervised machine learning models for comparisons. Our experimental evaluation on multiple real-world data sets comparing the performance of several classifiers (including Feedforward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bag of Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Naïve Bayes), indicated the superiority of Random Forests in terms of the examined performance metrics (Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall, F-measure and G-mean).",decision support system; machine learning; random forests; urban planning,"Sideris N., Bardis G., Voulodimos A., Miaoulis G., Ghazanfarpour D.",10.3390/s19102266
397,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,Detecting advertising on building façades with computer vision,"Outdoor advertising influences the visual environment of any modern city. Advertising and information signs on building façades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on façades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of façade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building façades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality. The resulting approach can provide data for future research and help maintain coherent urban visual environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

401,,2019,Conference Paper,Multi-criteria Evaluation vs Perceived Urban Quality: An Exploratory Comparison,"This study compares a service-based and environmental evaluation of an urban area with that of its perceived walkability. The Pampulha region in Belo Horizonte, Brazil was first put through a multi-criteria spatial evaluation with respect to a set of spatial data considered relevant for liveability and quality of life in cities, and was subsequently assessed in terms of perceived walkability (using a machine learning procedure of a training set provided by local auditors). The two types of analysis were compared and qualitatively aggregated to obtain a joint spatial score of the urban environment. The findings provide useful insights for planning and urban policy. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Machine learning; Spatial multi-criteria analysis; Urban quality; Walkability assessment,"Blečić I., Santos A.G., Moura A.C., Trunfio G.A.",10.1007/978-3-030-24302-9_44
402,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,Development of generating system for architectural color icons using google map platform and tensorflow-segmentation,"In this research, the goal is to develop a generating system for architectural color icons using Google Map Platform and Tensorflow-Segmentation. There has been no case of developing a system that allows users to visualize the color tendency of buildings as architectural color icons for each building element from images of various regions. It is considered meaningful to be able to create criteria for decision making in architecture and the urban design by developing a system to clarify the current state of the architectural colors. It will contribute a rise in the consciousness of landscape conservation and be essential for the design of architectures and public objects. This paper includes the explanation of development method, use experiments, and consideration of five problems among architectural color icons creation. It is assumed that the accuracy of the present system will be better as the technology improves. © 2019 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Color analysis; Color palette; Google street view; Image segmentation; Machine learning,"Kato Y., Matsukawa S.",
413,10.0,2019,Article,Mapping long-term dynamics of population and dwellings based on a multi-temporal analysis of urban morphologies,"Information on the distribution and dynamics of dwellings and their inhabitants is essential to support decision-making in various fields such as energy provision, land use planning, risk assessment and disaster management. However, as various different of approaches to estimate the current distribution of population and dwellings exists, further evidence on past dynamics is needed for a better understanding of urban processes. This article therefore addresses the question of whether and how accurately historical distributions of dwellings and inhabitants can be reconstructed with commonly available geodata from national mapping and cadastral agencies. For this purpose, an approach for the automatic derivation of such information is presented. The data basis is constituted by a current digital landscape model and a 3D building model combined with historical land use information automatically extracted from historical topographic maps. For this purpose, methods of image processing, machine learning, change detection and dasymetric mapping are applied. The results for a study area in Germany show that it is possible to automatically derive decadal historical patterns of population and dwellings from 1950 to 2011 at the level of a 100 m grid with slight underestimations and acceptable standard deviations. By a differentiated analysis we were able to quantify the errors for different urban structure types. © 2018 by the authors.",Dasymetric mapping; Dwelling units; Dynamics; Estimation; Historical demography; Multi-temporal; Population; Topographic maps; Urban morphology; Urban planning,"Hecht R., Herold H., Behnisch M., Jehling M.",10.3390/ijgi8010002
513,,2017,Conference Paper,The syntactic signature of starbucks' locations Towards a machine-learning approach to location decision-making,"The space syntax Theory of Natural Movement postulates that everything else being equal, land use selects their location based on the asymmetry of accessibility created by the configuration of the street network. In this article, I test the hypothesis whether configurational (syntactic) properties of an urban street network are relevant for the location of land use. If syntactic features are relevant, then land use types may have a 'syntactic signature'. To identify this blueprint, I apply machine-learning techniques to datasets of syntactic measures, for ten business types. The results are ten models, each with the syntactic blueprint of a type of business. The models are used to predict the existence, or not, of such businesses in segments of the map of London. The performance of the models varies, with fifty per cent reaching statistical significance, including one with 'good' prediction ability. The models for Starbucks coffee shops and solicitor's offices have the strongest prediction ability. The exploratory exercise demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning method Random Forests, when supervised and individually applied to a business activity, to identify the syntactic signature of business types. Such models can be used during planning and design and on location studies. The results strengthen the candidacy of syntactic measurements to location-decision-making. Moreover, they reinforce the theory of Natural Movement.",Land use; Machine-learning; Random forest; Space syntax; Spatial configuration; Urban planning.,Silva J.P.,
535,,2016,Conference Paper,Feature selection and knowledge extraction from buppu 2000 and 2010 censuses using artificial intelligence,"The census of population and dwellings undertaken by national state institutions world over at regular time intervals, is a fantastic source of information. However, there are major challenges to overcome when transforming the census data that usually consists of a vast number of attributes, into useful knowledge. In this paper, an artificial intelligent approach is investigated to select appropriate attribute features that indicate interesting patterns in Beppu census wards in 2000 and 2010. The results of the SOM (unsupervised artificial neural network) based clustering, GIS visualisation and machine learning (J48 and JRip functions of WEKA), provide relevant discerning features, new patterns and new knowledge that can be of use in many application domains, such as urban planning, resources management and transport planning. © 2015 IEEE.",component; GIS mapping; JRip and J48 (WEKA); Self-organising map clustering,"Shanmuganathan S., Yan L.",10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382087
577,5.0,2012,Conference Paper,Classification of urban scenes from georeferenced images in urban street-view context,"This paper addresses the challenging problem of scene classification in street-view georeferenced images of urban environments. More precisely, the goal of this task is semantic image classification, consisting in predicting in a given image, the presence or absence of a pre-defined class (e.g. shops, vegetation, etc.). The approach is based on the BOSSA representation, which enriches the Bag of Words (BoW) model, in conjunction with the Spatial Pyramid Matching scheme and kernel-based machine learning techniques. The proposed method handles problems that arise in large scale urban environments due to acquisition conditions (static and dynamic objects/pedestrians) combined with the continuous acquisition of data along the vehicles direction, the varying light conditions and strong occlusions (due to the presence of trees, traffic signs, cars, etc.) giving rise to high intra-class variability. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset of high resolution images collected from two main avenues from the 12th district in Paris and the approach shows promising results. © 2012 IEEE.",kernel-based machine learning; semantic image classification; spatial pyramid matching; street-level images; visual words,"Iovan C., Picard D., Thome N., Cord M.",10.1109/ICMLA.2012.171
591,8.0,2008,Conference Paper,Urban Data Mining using emergent SOM,The term of Urban Data-Mining is defined to describe a methodological approach that discovers logical or mathematical and partly complex descriptions of urban patterns and regularities inside the data. The concept of data mining in connection with knowledge discovery techniques plays an important role for the empirical examination of high dimensional data in the field of urban research. The procedures on the basis of knowledge discovery systems are currently not exactly scrutinised for a meaningful integration into the regional and urban planning and development process. In this study ESOM is used to examine communities in Germany. The data deals with the question of dynamic processes (e.g. shrinking and growing of cities). In the future it might be possible to establish an instrument that defines objective criteria for the benchmark process about urban phenomena. The use of GIS supplements the process of knowledge conversion and communication.,,"Behnisch M., Ultsch A.",10.1007/978-3-540-78246-9_37
