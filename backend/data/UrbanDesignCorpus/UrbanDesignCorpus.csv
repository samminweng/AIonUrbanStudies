Reviews of this topic have generally focused on a specific type of benefit, been limited to a single discipline, or covered the benefits delivered from a particular type of interaction. Here we construct novel typologies of the settings, interactions and potential benefits of people-nature experiences, and use these to organise an assessment of the benefits of interacting with nature. We discover that evidence for the benefits of interacting with nature is geographically biased towards high latitudes and Western societies, potentially contributing to a focus on certain types of settings and benefits. Social scientists have been the most active researchers in this field. Contributions from ecologists are few in number, perhaps hindering the identification of key ecological features of the natural environment that deliver human benefits. Although many types of benefits have been studied, benefits to physical health, cognitive performance and psychological well-being have received much more attention than the social or spiritual benefits of interacting with nature, despite the potential for important consequences arising from the latter. The evidence for most benefits is correlational, and although there are several experimental studies, little as yet is known about the mechanisms that are important for delivering these benefits. For example, we do not know which characteristics of natural settings (e.g., biodiversity, level of disturbance, proximity, accessibility) are most important for triggering a beneficial interaction, and how these characteristics vary in importance among cultures, geographic regions and socio-economic groups. These are key directions for future research if we are to design landscapes that promote high quality interactions between people and nature in a rapidly urbanising world. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Ecosystem services; Health benefits; Urbanisation","ecosystem service; health care; nature-society relations; urbanization; biodiversity; biotypology; cognition; ecosystem restoration; environmental economics; environmental factor; environmental health; geographic distribution; human; latitude; natural science; psychological well being; review; social aspect; social interaction; socioeconomics; spiritual care; urban area; urbanization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875274625

This question is becoming increasingly urgent to answer as we face diminishing fossil-fuel resources and the effects of a changing climate while global cities continue to compete to be the most vibrant centers of culture, knowledge, and finance. Jan Gehl has been examining this question since the 1960s, when few urban designers or planners were thinking about designing cities for people. But given the unpredictable, complex and ephemeral nature of life in cities, how can we best design public infrastructure vital to cities for getting from place to place, or staying in place for human use? Studying city life and understanding the factors that encourage or discourage use is the key to designing inviting public space. © 2013 Jan Gehl and Birgitte Svarre.

This review paper explores the wide spectrum of human dimensions and issues, or human needs, addressed by 90 of these studies. As a basis for analysis, the major themes tapped by the findings were classified into two overarching groups containing three categories each. The Nature needs, directly linked with the physical features of the environmental setting, were categorized in terms of contact with nature, aesthetic preference, and recreation and play. The role of the environment is less immediate in the Human-interaction group, which includes the issues of social interaction, citizen participation in the design process, and community identity. Most significantly, the publications offer strong support for the important role nearby natural environments play in human well-being. Urban settings that provide nature contact are valuable not only in their own right, but also for meeting other needs in a manner unique to these more natural settings. In addition, although addressed in different ways, remarkable similarities exist concerning these six people requirements across diverse cultures and political systems. Urban residents worldwide express a desire for contact with nature and each other, attractive environments, places in which to recreate and play, privacy, a more active role in the design of their community, and a sense of community identity. The studies reviewed here offer continued evidence that the design of urban landscapes strongly influences the well-being and behavior of users and nearby inhabitants. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Critical approaches to technology design are of both practical and social importance in the home. Home appliances are loaded with cultural associations such as the gendered division of domestic labor that are easy to overlook. Further, homes are not the same everywhere - even within a country. Peoples' aspirations and desires differ greatly across and between cultures. The target of western domestic technology design is often not the user, but the consumer. Web refrigerators that create shopping lists, garbage cans that let advertisers know what is thrown away, cabinets that monitor their contents and order more when supplies are low are central to current images of the wireless, digital home of the future. Drawing from our research in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia, we provide three different narratives of defamiliarization. A historical reading of American kitchens provides a lens with which to scrutinize new technologies of domesticity, an ethnographic account of an extended social unit in England problematizes taken-for-granted domestic technologies, and a comparative ethnography of the role of information and communication technologies in the daily lives of urban Asia's middle classes reveals the ways in which new technologies can be captured and domesticated in unexpected ways. In the final section of the article, we build on these moments of defamiliarization to suggest a broad set of challenges and strategies for design in the home. © 2005 ACM.","Anthropology; Defamiliarization; Domestic labor; Domestic technology; Ethnicity; Ethnography; Gender; Home entertainment; Human-computer interaction","Anthropology; Defamiliarization; Domestic labor; Domestic technology; Ethnicity; Ethnography; Gender; Home entertainment; Human-computer interaction; Human computer interaction; Product design; Strategic planning; Technology transfer; World Wide Web; Domestic appliances",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644512594

The ten questions presented in this paper range from the very basic definitions underlying the emerging soundscape science, to more applied topics about how to use soundscape as a design approach for the planning and management of the built environments. Although significant research activity has been conducted so far, there is still a need to systematically provide the underpinning science and practical guidance in soundscaping.

The TCC is conceptualized in terms of four fractions: (1) Those who own and/or and control the major transnational corporations and their local affiliates (corporate fraction). In architecture these are the major architectural, architecture-engineering and architecture-developer-real estate firms. In comparison with the major global consumer goods, energy and financial corporations the revenues of the biggest firms in the architecture industry are quite small. However, their importance for the built environment and their cultural importance, especially in cities, far outweighs their relative lack of financial and corporate muscle. (2) Globalizing politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction). These are the politicians and bureaucrats at all levels of administrative power and responsibility who actually decide what gets built where, and how changes to the built environment are regulated. (3) Globalizing professionals (technical fraction). The members of this fraction range from the leading technicians centrally involved in the structural features of new building to those responsible for the education of students and the public in architecture. (4) Merchants and media (consumerist fraction). These are the people who are responsible for the marketing of architecture in all its manifestations. (There is obviously some overlap between the membership of these fractions.). My conclusion is that many global and aspiring global cities have looked to iconic architecture as a prime strategy of urban intervention, often in the context of rehabilitation of depressed areas. The attempt to identify the agents most responsible for this transformation, namely the TCC, and to explain how they operate, suggests that deliberately iconic architecture is becoming a global phenomenon, specifically a central urban manifestation of the culture-ideology of consumerism. © Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.",,"architecture; globalization; urban design; urban development; world city",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747128150

Although society often thinks of creative individuals as working in isolation, intelligence and creativity result in large part from interaction and collaboration with other individuals. Much human creativity is social, arising from activities that take place in a context in which interaction with other people and the artifacts that embody collective knowledge are essential contributors. This paper examines: (1) how individual and social creativity can be integrated by means of proper collaboration models and tools supporting distributed cognition; (2) how the creation of shareable externalizations (""boundary objects"") and the adoption of evolutionary process models in the construction of meta-design environments can enhance creativity and support spontaneous design activities (""unselfconscious cultures of design""); and (3) how a new design competence is emerging - one that requires passage from individual creative actions to synergetic activities, from the reflective practitioner to reflective communities and from given tasks to personally meaningful activities. The paper offers examples in the context of collaborative design and art practice, including urban planning, interactive art and open source. In the effort to draw a viable path ""beyond binary choices"", the paper points out some major challenges for the next generation of socio-technical environments to further increase the integration of individual and social creativity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Design, setting and participants: Qualitative study involving indepth interviews between 1 March 2006 and 30 September 2007 with 30 Aboriginal people affected by cancer from across WA. Main outcome measures: Aboriginal patients' views about the quality of communication within the hospitals, factors impairing communication and suggestions for improvement. Results: Factors crucial to effective patient - provider communication such as language, shared understanding, knowledge and use of medical terminology require attention. Additionally, communication between Aboriginal people and health care professionals needs to be understood within a broader sociocultural and political context. Fear of the medical system and of being disempowered; mistrust; collective memories of the experience of colonisation and its aftermath; lack of understanding of Aboriginal customs, values, lifestyle and the importance of family and land; and experiences of racism were key issues impairing communication. Health service providers' inability to interpret non-verbal communication and the symbolism of hospital environments also posed problems. Conclusion: Key areas for the attention of health service providers in communicating and caring for Aboriginal people in the hospital setting include culturally sensitive and empathetic personal contact, acknowledgement and respect for Aboriginal family structures, culture and life circumstances, an understanding of the significant role of non-verbal communication, and the importance of history, land and community. Employing more Aboriginal health workers in hospitals, and allowing Aboriginal people to participate at a decision-making level in hospitals is likely to improve Aboriginal people's access to cancer treatment, and would be important symbols of progress in this area.",,"article; attitude to health; Australia; cancer therapy; clinical article; controlled study; family; female; health care personnel; health service; human; interpersonal communication; interview; land biome; lifestyle; male; medical decision making; neoplasm; nomenclature; politics; qualitative analysis; racism; social class; trust; Aborigine; adult; cohort analysis; communication disorder; ethnology; health care delivery; human relation; middle aged; neoplasm; patient attitude; rural population; social psychology; urban population; Adult; Cohort Studies; Communication Barriers; Family; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prejudice; Professional-Patient Relations; Rural Population; Urban Population; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149092377

Many Indigenous communities have flourished, however, the impact of colonialism continues to have profound health effects for Indigenous peoples in Canada and internationally. Despite increasing evidence of health status inequities affecting Indigenous populations, health services often fail to address health and social inequities as routine aspects of health care delivery. In this paper, we discuss an evidence-based framework and specific strategies for promoting health care equity for Indigenous populations. Methods: Using an ethnographic design and mixed methods, this study was conducted at two Urban Aboriginal Health Centres located in two inner cities in Canada, which serve a combined patient population of 5,500. Data collection included in-depth interviews with a total of 114 patients and staff (n = 73 patients; n = 41 staff), and over 900 h of participant observation focused on staff members' interactions and patterns of relating with patients. Results: Four key dimensions of equity-oriented health services are foundational to supporting the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples: inequity-responsive care, culturally safe care, trauma- and violence-informed care, and contextually tailored care. Partnerships with Indigenous leaders, agencies, and communities are required to operationalize and tailor these key dimensions to local contexts. We discuss 10 strategies that intersect to optimize effectiveness of health care services for Indigenous peoples, and provide examples of how they can be implemented in a variety of health care settings. Conclusions: While the key dimensions of equity-oriented care and 10 strategies may be most optimally operationalized in the context of interdisciplinary teamwork, they also serve as health equity guidelines for organizations and providers working in various settings, including individual primary care practices. These strategies provide a basis for organizational-level interventions to promote the provision of more equitable, responsive, and respectful PHC services for Indigenous populations. Given the similarities in colonizing processes and Indigenous peoples' experiences of such processes in many countries, these strategies have international applicability. © 2016 The Author(s).","Canada; Cultural safety; Discrimination; Health disparities; Health equity; Health services; Indigenous people; Racism; Structural violence; Trauma informed care; Trauma- and violence-informed care","American Indian; Canada; clinical trial; cultural anthropology; ethnology; exposure to violence; health care disparity; health equity; human; indigenous health care; multicenter study; organizational policy; prevention and control; primary health care; professional-patient relationship; racism; standards; statistics and numerical data; trust; violence; Anthropology, Cultural; Canada; Culture; Exposure to Violence; Health Equity; Health Services, Indigenous; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Indians, North American; Organizational Policy; Primary Health Care; Professional-Patient Relations; Racism; Trust; Violence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990864927

Moreover, it treats environmental sounds as a resource rather than a waste. Soundscape and the Built Environment is the first book to systematically discuss soundscape in the built environment. It begins with a presentation of theory and basic background, answering questions such as: what is soundscape, how is it important, and how does it affect people in terms of their health and perception on the acoustic environment. The book then sets out tools for implementing a soundscape approach, with measurement techniques, mapping, and good soundscape practices. It also delivers a series of examples of the application of the soundscape approach in planning, design, and assessment. Discusses soundscape and environmental noise Explores cultural variations and the way they influence soundscape Introduces binaural measurement technology and psychoacoustics Examines the physical, psychological, and physiological restorative mechanism of high-quality acoustic environments Presents soundscape mapping based on human perception of sound sources Includes real-world examples and case studies highlighting the key issues in soundscape intervention Soundscape and the Built Environment is written by a group of leading international figures and derives from a four-year EU COST project on Soundscapes of European Cities and Landscapes.

However, to develop guidelines, thermal comfort ranges need to be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating different thermal environments in Damascus during summer and winter. A second aim was to define the lower and upper limits of the thermal comfort range for some of these indices. The study was based on comprehensive micrometeorological measurements combined with questionnaires. It was found that the thermal conditions of different outdoor environments vary considerably. In general, Old Damascus, with its deep canyons, is more comfortable in summer than modern Damascus where there is a lack of shade. Conversely, residential areas and parks in modern Damascus are more comfortable in winter due to more solar access. The neutral temperatures of both the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and the outdoor standard effective temperature (OUT_SET*) were found to be lower in summer than in winter. At 80 % acceptability, the study defined the lower comfort limit in winter to 21.0 °C and the upper limit in summer to 31.3 °C for PET. For OUT_SET*, the corresponding lower and upper limits were 27.6 °C and 31.3 °C respectively. OUT_SET* showed a better correlation with the thermal sensation votes than PET.

Design: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients receiving percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes between March and September 2002. QI interventions including a palliative care consulting service and educational programmes were instituted. We conducted a second chart review for all patients receiving feeding tubes between March and September 2003. Setting: 652 bed urban acute care hospital. Key measures for improvement: We measured the number of feeding tubes placed in patients with dementia, the number of feeding tubes placed in patients with dementia capable of taking food by mouth, and the number of feeding tubes placed in patients with dementia with an advance directive stating the wish to forgo artificial nutrition and hydration. Strategies for change: Medical and allied health staff received educational programmes on end of life care and on feeding management of patients with dementia. A palliative care consulting team was established. Effects of change: After the interventions, the number of feeding tubes placed in all patients and in patients with dementia was greatly reduced. Lessons learnt: Multidisciplinary involvement, including participation by the administration, was essential to effect change in practice. The intensive focus on a particular issue and rapid change led to ""culture shift"" within the hospital community. The need to establish unified goals of care for each patient was highlighted. Background: A growing body of research over the past decade has questioned the utility of placing feeding tubes (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) or jejunostomy) in patients with advanced dementia.1 Studies have found no evidence that feeding tubes in this population prevent aspiration, 2 3 prolong life,4-6 improve overall function,7 or reduce pressure sores.8 Additionally, the quality of life of a patient with advanced dementia can be adversely affected when a feeding tube is inserted. The patient may require wrist restraints to prevent pulling on the tube1 3 or may develop cellulitis at the gastrostomy site, develop decubitus ulcers, 1 be deprived of the social interaction and pleasure surrounding meals,9 10 and require placement in a nursing home. Unfortunately, many doctors are unfamiliar with this literature or face barriers - attitudinal, institutional, or imposed by the healthcare industry - to applying its findings to their practice.11 Thus feeding tubes are placed in patients who will not benefit from this intervention and whose quality of life in the terminal stage of their illness will be adversely affected. With the expected increase of elderly people with dementia,12 a great change in doctors' knowledge, attitudes, and practice is necessary to prevent even greater numbers of patients receiving this futile treatment.",,"clinical practice; community; consultation; controlled study; dementia; disease severity; endoscopy; feeding apparatus; feeding behavior; food intake; gastrostomy; hospital; human; hydration; jejunostomy; major clinical study; measurement; medical education; medical record; medical staff; methodology; mouth; nutrition; palliative therapy; patient; patient care; priority journal; quality control; retrospective study; review; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344581231

The results revealed some universal similarities to, as well as some distinct differences from, other cultures in attitudes towards urban parks. People in Turkey use urban parks generally for passive recreational activities such as picnicking, resting and relaxing, in contrast to Western countries where urban parks are generally used for walking, dog walking, sports activities and exercise. In contrast to a common concern about personal safety in urban parks, this study determined a positive perception of safety among Turkish people.

Design/methodology/approach: The study, conducted during the Chinese New Year in early 2006, used in-depth interviews with 15 consumers in Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. Findings: The results suggest that Chinese consume Chinese spirits for all occasions, yet consume red wine only for special occasions such as Chinese new year and other holidays. A key point for selling red wine to the Chinese is its positive image; drinking red wine is considered trendy and shows good taste. Another key point is consumer perceptions of red wine as healthier than Chinese spirits because wine contains less alcohol. Two other findings are that most Chinese consumers assume all wine is red wine and have little wine knowledge. Most respondents did not know of white wine or that Australia produces wine. Finally, China's culture of face value, mianzi, plays a key role in purchasing and consuming wine. Chinese tend to purchase inexpensive wine for private consumption and public occasions, yielding more mianzi in front of others. In some important occasions, consumers will purchase a foreign (French) red wine to impress their guests and obtain even more mianzi. In most situations, Chinese purchase and consume wine for perceived health and symbolic - lucky or good face - values. Research limitations/implications: The small sample size is a limitation. Another limitation is that all the respondents lived in the urban area of Guangzhou, one of China's most developed cities. The findings do not generalize to China. Practical implications: The findings suggest that wine is a symbolic product rather than a necessity product in China; therefore, image is an important attribute for selling wine in China. Furthermore, limited wine knowledge tends to make Chinese consumers rely heavily on price for their wine purchasing decisions, as price relates to mainzi. Chinese consumers' high awareness of France as a wine making country and their deep-rooted positive beliefs about French wines pose difficulties for marketing other foreign wines, such as Australian wines, in China. Originality/value: This is perhaps the first academic study in English of Chinese wine consumption and wine purchasing. It offers important insights on the characteristics of wine consumption and purchasing in China. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Consumers; Consumption; Red wines; Wines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72049094133

Design/methodology/approach - Using a survey among a large sample of people in the city of Tianjin, gift-giving behavior was measured by the importance accorded to gift-giving, the amount given, the effort spent on gift selection and brand orientation when selecting gifts. The cultural values examined were renqing (human obligations), guanxi (relationship), yuan (destiny or fate), reciprocity, family orientation and Mianzi (face). Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data. Findings - Results indicated that Chinese cultural values as a whole as well as most of its components investigated in this research had positive effects on the various gift-giving behaviors. The ""face"" component was, however, found to affect only the importance attached to gift-giving, the amount given and the choice of brand. Research limitations/implications - Research results should be interpreted with caution as the study was limited to Tianjin - one of the several major cities in the PRC. Also the Chinese New Year may not be representative of other occasions when gifts are exchanged. Practical implications - The results of this investigation would benefit practitioners involved in the marketing of ""gift items"" in the PRC by providing them with a clear understanding of the general consumption patterns of the PRC urban consumers, insights into the various antecedents of gift-giving and linking them with various aspects of Chinese cultural values. The research findings would also benefit researchers, academics and others interested in the PRC market by making them familiar with some of the salient aspects that characterize Chinese consumers. Originality/value - This study develops a new model describing the relationships among values (Chinese cultural value and personal value), motivation for gift-giving and gift-giving behavior. It also develops new scales for measuring the constructs such as Chinese cultural values, motivation for gift-giving and gift-giving behavior. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Consumer behaviour; National cultures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547313676

M2J 5B6, Canada","An analytical account of the history and aspirations of the Alex Wilson Community Garden in Toronto provides an ideal opportunity to examine the connections between two typically distinct enterprises: ecological restoration and community gardening. These are both important contemporary ecological movements, but are rarely combined in a single project that demonstrates the principles of sustainable land use and community planning. The garden is named in memory of Alex Wilson, a landscape designer, community activist and writer who worked and lived in Toronto, Canada. During his life, Wilson established a community garden which was eventually replaced by conventional urban development. After his death in 1993, friends and colleagues decided to honour his memory by establishing a permanent community garden in his name. The Alex Wilson Community Garden opened to the public in June 1998. The case-study explores how the garden reflects Wilson's work by linking community gardening and ecological restoration. These features are unified in Wilson's work as a means of nurturing relationships between people, communities and the landscape-relationships that are social, economic and ecological. In his book, The Culture of Nature: North American landscape from Disney to the Exxon Valdez (1991), Wilson argues that 'we must build landscapes that heal and empower, that make intelligible our relations with each other and the natural world'. The Alex Wilson Community Garden illustrates in a practical manner the principles espoused by Wilson through its design, planning and functioning. The case-study reports on the innovative approach to landscape design taken in the garden, which reconstructs the natural and cultural history of southern Ontario, featuring lake-shore, agricultural and woodland sections. The garden has been planted exclusively with native plant species, and is expected to have a positive impact on local biodiversity. The planning process which led up to the design of the garden was participatory in nature, encompassing friends and colleagues of Alex Wilson, local residents and city planning officials, and made use of a number of planning tools not usually applied in an urban setting, including the granting of a conservation easement. The garden also addresses emerging issues associated with globalisation and large cities by providing food production opportunities for local residents, including a low-income housing complex and a nearby drop-in centre. Ecological monitoring and assessment of the naturalised area will be carried out by local residents.",,"community organization; land use planning; sustainable development; Canada; Ontario; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032953681

Over 200 million people live on Europe's coastline, and aquatic environments are the top recreational destination in the region. In terms of public health, interactions with 'blue space' (eg, coasts, rivers, lakes) are often considered solely in terms of risk (eg, drowning, microbial pollution). Exposure to blue space can, however, promote health and well-being and prevent disease, although underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Aims and methods The BlueHealth project aims to understand the relationships between exposure to blue space and health and well-being, to map and quantify the public health impacts of changes to both natural blue spaces and associated urban infrastructure in Europe, and to provide evidence-based information to policymakers on how to maximise health benefits associated with interventions in and around aquatic environments. To achieve these aims, an evidence base will be created through systematic reviews, analyses of secondary data sets and analyses of new data collected through a bespoke international survey and a wide range of community-level interventions. We will also explore how to deliver the benefits associated with blue spaces to those without direct access through the use of virtual reality. Scenarios will be developed that allow the evaluation of health impacts in plausible future societal contexts and changing environments. BlueHealth will develop key inputs into policymaking and land/water-use planning towards more salutogenic and sustainable uses of blue space, particularly in urban areas. Ethics and dissemination Throughout the BlueHealth project, ethics review and approval are obtained for all relevant aspects of the study by the local ethics committees prior to any work being initiated and an ethics expert has been appointed to the project advisory board. So far, ethical approval has been obtained for the BlueHealth International Survey and for community-level interventions taking place in Spain, Italy and the UK. Engagement of stakeholders, including the public, involves citizens in many aspects of the project. Results of all individual studies within the BlueHealth project will be published with open access. After full anonymisation and application of any measures necessary to prevent disclosure, data generated in the project will be deposited into open data repositories of the partner institutions, in line with a formal data management plan. Other knowledge and tools developed in the project will be made available via the project website (www.bluehealth2020.eu). Project results will ultimately provide key inputs to planning and policy relating to blue space, further stimulating the integration of environmental and health considerations into decision-making, such that blue infrastructure is developed across Europe with both public health and the environment in mind. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: Major urban medical center in NanJing, China. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred twelve subjects aged 60 and older who presented to the general medical clinic. The mean age of the participants was 70, and 34% were female. Mean education level was 8.5 years of schooling. MEASUREMENTS: Loneliness was assessed using validated instruments, and direct questions were asked regarding mistreatment experienced by older adults. RESULTS: Elder mistreatment was found in 35.2% of the participants. After adjusting for confounding factors, feeling of often lacking companionship (odds ratio (OR)=4.06; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.49-11.10) and feeling of sometimes being left out in life (OR=1.69; 95% CI=1.01-2.84) were positively associated with the risk of mistreatment. Risk of mistreatment was also correlated with higher total loneliness scores (OR=2.74; 95% CI=1.19-6.26). CONCLUSION: Loneliness appeared to be a risk factor associated with elder mistreatment in this older Chinese population. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding. An exploration of Chinese culture and tradition may yield insight into shaping a prevention framework for mistreatment of older Chinese people. © 2007, The American Geriatrics Society.","Chinese population; Cross-sectional study; Elder abuse and neglect; Elder mistreatment; Loneliness","adult; aged; article; Chinese; confidence interval; confounding variable; correlation coefficient; crime; cultural anthropology; female; human; loneliness; male; neglect; normal human; risk; risk factor; validation study; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Elder Abuse; Female; Hospitals, Community; Hospitals, Urban; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Middle Aged; Personality Assessment; Risk Factors; Statistics as Topic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35748957768

The article looks at how specific cultural quarters are developed in city centre areas, focusing on an area of Manchester known as the Northern Quarter, and outlines the ways in which urban design techniques are used as part of the process of wider cultural regeneration.

The causes of both events are strikingly similar. Both were caused by a combination of high tides, low atmospheric pressure, high winds and the failure of poorly maintained flood defences. In both cases the number of deaths was related to the vulnerability of the buildings and people. Buildings in the flood zones were often single storey bungalows and the people who died were mostly over 60 yr of age. Both tragedies were national disasters. The 1953 flood in England acted as a catalyst for an acceleration in flood risk management policy and practice. It resulted in: the development of a Storm Tide Warning System for the east coast of England; the setting of new design standards for coastal flood defences; increased investment in improving coastal defences; and a substantial new research effort into coastal processes, protection and forecasting. In France there has also been an episodic shift in flood risk management policy with the focus falling on: control of urban developments in areas at risk of flooding; improved coastal forecasting and warning; strengthening of flood defences; and developing a ""culture of risk awareness"". This paper outlines the lessons that can be learnt from the two events and provides recommendations concerning how future loss of life as a result of coastal flooding can be reduced. © 2012 Author(s).",,"building; coastal protection; coastal zone; comparative study; flooding; hazard management; vulnerability; warning system; England; France; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861540560

In burgeoning poor urban settlements growing on city margins, autonomous adaptation strategies are often the only measures to respond to increasing climatic and compounding stressors. Yet, in both research and practice there remains lack of understanding regarding the dynamics of adaptation and risk reduction at the level of the community. In this paper, we argue urban slums are ideal places to consider adaptation because they offer examples of more extreme social-ecological stress than one finds in more established communities - the kind we can anticipate more broadly in the face of climate change. A framework for identifying local adaptation processes is presented and applied to analyse the case of Mathare Valley Slums in Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated suburb, where residents are regularly exposed to flooding from heavy rainfall. Findings reveal that slums, often viewed as illegitimate, makeshift, and temporary settlements, are places experienced by many residents as permanent communities characterised by rapid environmental change. Processes of adaptation in Mathare have become institutionalised through time, as a new generation of people imagine themselves staying and (re)organise to achieve a higher level of functioning through various strategies to reduce risk. Innovative and revitalising adaptation occurs as residents shift from employing more generic and expected coping strategies, such as evacuating homes or economic diversification, to creating ""gated"" communities and savings schemes to maintain and improve the settlement, despite uncertain tenure. Both formal and informal institutions, such as youth groups, play an important role in governing such heterogeneous localities, incrementally upgrading the slum and providing critical public services. Long-term residents' increasing recognition of the permanence of the slum community and its stressful conditions appears to lead to more collective action toward adaptation pathways. However, this is in marked contrast to the dominant non-local perspective of Mathare's status as both impermanent and illegal, which prevails among government officials. As such, strategies are generally not incorporated into planned interventions. While progressive policies designed to reduce risk exist, they remain nascent in their establishment and fail to benefit slumdwellers. The case illustrates the need to incorporate the wealth of knowledge, techniques, and experience extant at the community level in the development of adaptation planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Autonomous adaptation; Climate change; Flooding; Mathare valley slums; Urban slums; Urbanisation","climate change; environmental change; flooding; global change; human settlement; innovation; institutional framework; nature-society relations; periurban area; urban design; urbanization; Kenya; Nairobi [Kenya]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928805685

There is a need to include disabling psychotic disorders in order to plan clinical services in these settings. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of key clinical disorders in Timor Leste (East Timor), and to assess cultural factors that may influence help-seeking patterns. Design, Setting, Participants: A 2-phase total population survey of 1544 adults in an urban and a rural area of Timor Leste. Phase 1 involved a household informant survey using indigenous terms to detect psychosis and a screen of all adults for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of psychologic distress, including depression and anxiety. In phase 2, clinicians interviewed all those identified by household informants and half of those who screened positive in order to assign DSM-IV diagnoses. Disability, explanatory models, and perceived needs were also assessed. Main Outcome Measures: Phase 1: Demographic characteristics; trauma events and PTSD (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire); psychologic distress (Kessler-10 scale). Phase 2; Structured Clinical Interview for relevant DSM-IV diagnoses; the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scales; and the modified Short Explanatory Model Interview. Results: The household informant method in phase 1 detected mainly psychotic disorders, and the screen method detected PTSD and depression. Phase 2 yielded a DSM-IV point prevalence estimate of 5.1% (including psychosis, 1.35%; and PTSD, 1.47%). Psychotic disorders were most disabling, primarily attributed to supernatural causes and treated mainly by traditional healers. Those with depression and PTSD experienced substantial disability but had received little treatment. They attributed their mental problems to social and traumatic causes. Conclusions: Our 2-phase method proved effective for identifying the range of disorders relevant to planning clinical services in postconflict developing countries.

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which nowadays has exceeded 2.5 million notified infections in the world and about 200,000 deaths, is a strong reminder that urbanization has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and it’s necessary to make the systems and local capacities resilient to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. How we can re-design the concept of Public Health in relation to the built environment and the contemporary cities? Methods. According to the previous statements and scenario, aim of this paper is to integrate the Urban Health strategic objectives, focusing the possible responses, both immediate and medium-long term, to the current environmental, social, and economic aspects of the ‘period’ of physical distancing. Results.Immediate Actions are 01. program the flexibility of city schedules; 02. plan a smart and sustainable mobility network; 03. define a neighborhood services’ plan; 04. develop a digitization of the urban context, promoting the smart communities; 05. re-think the accessibility to the places of culture and tourism. Medium-long term Actions are 06. design the indoor flexibility of domestic living spaces; 07. re-think building typologies, fostering the presence of semi-private or collective spaces; 08. renovate the basic care services’ network; 09. integrate the existing environmental emergency plans, with those related to the health emergencies; 10. improve stakeholders’ awareness of the factors affecting Public Health in the cities. Conclusions. The Decalogue of Public Health opportunities may provide a useful basis for Designers (Architects and Urban Planners), Policy Makers, Public Health experts and Local Health Agencies, in promoting actions and policies aimed to transform our cities in healthier and Salutogenic living environments. © Mattioli 1885.","Care Services’ Network; City Schedules; Emergency Mobility Network; Post-COVID19 Cities; Post-COVID19 Communities; Post-COVID19 Urban Health; PostCOVID19 Living Spaces; Public Health Decalogue; Resilient Cities; Urban Digitization","air quality; Article; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency care; health care management; health care planning; health care quality; health promotion; human; information technology; pandemic; physical activity; public health; social distance; traffic and transport; urban area; Betacoronavirus; cultural anthropology; emergency health service; public health; urban health; Betacoronavirus; Culture; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Public Health; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084940342

Design: Prospective, population based study. Setting: Population of 15 rural and urban centres in 10 European countries. Participants: Altogether 3496 men and women born between 1900 and 1920 who participated in the baseline survey of the HALE project in 1988-1991. The study population was examined again about five (in 1993-1995) and 10 (in 1999-2001) years after the baseline examination. Main outcome measures: Physical functioning was measured by means of a self administered questionnaire of activities of daily living (ADL). Dichotomised prevalence of disability and need for help in self care and mobility ADL were used as dependent variables in the analyses. Results: Prevalence of disability and need for help tended to be higher in women than in men and in mobility abilities than in self care activities. Disability and need for help increased with advancing age but ameliorated over time from one birth cohort to another. In longitudinal analyses this beneficial time trend was independent of the effect of age, study, and region in self care disability in men and women (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.97 and OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97, respectively) and self care need for help in men (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96). Mobility disability among men and self care disability among women decreased more in the south than in the north. Conclusion: While European populations are aging, the proportions of elderly people with disability are decreasing. These results suggest that dynamics of functioning may differ across cultures. Future studies are needed to clarify which potentially modifiable and culturally determined factors protect against functional decline.",,"elderly population; age; aged; article; cultural factor; daily life activity; disability; Europe; female; human; longitudinal study; male; mobilization; physical capacity; prospective study; self care; sex difference; Activities of Daily Living; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disabled Persons; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Regression Analysis; Residence Characteristics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644423531

This study used qualitative methods to examine these factors in Native Hawaiian cancer survivors. METHEODS: Eight focus groups were held on five islands, attracting 45 Native Hawaiian cancer survivors from both rural and urban locales. The focus groups explored survivors' experiences with cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. Participatory research methods were used with researchers gaining community input on study design, incorporating appropriate Native Hawaiian cultural protocols into the focus groups, and engaging participants in the interpretation of the data. RESULTS: Similar to cancer survivors of other ethnicities, these individuals demonstrated the following: success in accessing healthcare information, professionals, facilities, and insurance; the ability to overcome the barriers confronted and proactive health behaviors regarding screening, diagnosis, and treatment. They also demonstrated ways in which they were sustained through the cancer experience by Native Hawaiian traditions, such as helping others, gaining strength from Hawaiian spiritual beliefs, and relying on family for personal support. Participants did not respond passively to their cancer diagnoses, and they expressed few fatalistic attitudes. Participants did give numerous examples of other Native Hawaiians who did not seek screening or treatment for cancer because they lacked insurance, had poor access to care or felt alienated by Western healthcare. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that improving access to care and incorporating cultural values in health education and services can enhance survivorship and quality of life for Native Hawaiians with cancer. These themes may have applications for other minority groups.","Attitudes; Barriers to care; Cancer; Cultural competence; Cultural values; Native Hawaiians","adult; aged; alienation; article; cancer mortality; cancer survival; cancer therapy; clinical article; cultural factor; education program; ethnic group; fatality; female; health care access; health care facility; health care utilization; health insurance; human; male; minority group; patient attitude; quality of life; religion; rural area; urban area; Attitude; Culture; Ethnic Groups; Female; Focus Groups; Hawaii; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Patient Education; Risk Factors; Social Support; Survival Rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0036318104

This study aimed to explore attitudes and perceptions among a peri-urban agricultural community towards sanitized human excreta and its use. The study adopted an exploratory design and collected data from 154 randomly selected households using questionnaires and focus group discussions. It was found that there is a general negative attitude to fresh excreta and the handling of it. However, the residents accept that excreta can be used as fertilizer, but they are not willing to use it on their own crops or consume crops fertilized with excreta.

Design, setting and participants: Review of prospectively collected data on all patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis at Royal Darwin Hospital, the Top End's tertiary referral centre, since 1 October 1989. Main outcome measures: Population-based annual incidence of melioidosis; differences in epidemiology, clinical presentations and outcomes for 2009- 2010 compared with the preceding 20 years. Results: In 2009-2010, the estimated population-based incidence of melioidosis was 50.2 cases per 100 000 in the Top End population overall, and 102.4 cases per 100 000 in the Top End Indigenous population. The proportion of patients acquiring melioidosis in the Darwin urban area increased from 49% in 1989-2009 to 65% in 2009-2010 (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.20-3.19).

Conclusions: In 2009-2010, the Top End had the highest annual incidence of melioidosis documented from anywhere to date. The prominent increase in cases in Darwin was associated with above average rainfall in Darwin during December 2009 to February 2010.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draw on Rabl and Kühlmann's Model of a corrupt action and the results of face-to-face interviews with 23 people working in the Australian construction industry. Findings: The results suggest that corruption is ambiguously defined yet perceived to be very common and primarily associated with personal gain rather than breaking the law. The main forms of corruption were identified as kickbacks, fraud and bribery and this behaviour is perceived to be driven by high goal feasibility, by conducive attitudes and supportive subjective norms and by high perceived behavioural control over being caught. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on a relatively small sample of 23 respondents and the use of snowball sampling may have meant that the respondents would tend to present a particular view of the industry. It is also important to point out that this research took place within a highly politicised environment coinciding the with launch of the third Royal Commission into corruption in the construction industry and is based on the respondent's perceptions of corruption rather than incontrovertible evidence of corruption in practice. Nevertheless, given the care the authors took to avoid these biases, it does provide a useful window in the incidence and types of corruption in construction and the behavioural factors that might influence it. Practical implications: In terms of tackling corruption, it is recommended that greater attention be given to exploring the culture of the industry which appears to normalise corrupt behaviour and to the hidden informal ""institutions"" which appear to be undermining the many formal policies and procedures which have been put in place to tackle corruption in the construction industry. Social implications: The global construction industry has been identified by Transparency International as the most bribery-prone of 19 industries it rated. The cost is huge with scarce resources being diverted from much needed urban regeneration, community concerns about development being ignored, individual human rights being abused, productivity and efficiency being compromised and important environments, cultures and heritage being destroyed. In Australia, concerns about corruption in the construction industry have led to an unprecedented three Royal Commissions which have argued that there is a culture which encourages, accepts and rewards this behaviour. Originality/value: By using Rabl and Kühlmann's Theory of a corrupt action this paper throws new light on how corruption is defined by members of the construction industry. The findings suggest that while formal technical and procedural solutions to corruption are important in addressing corruption they are likely to be undermined by strong cultures and informal institutions which dictate the ""rules of the game"" on the ground. There is a clear need to better understand how these informal institutions work to constrain formal rules devised to bring about reform. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; Corrupt action; Culture; Ethics; Industry; Management; Organizational culture","Cell culture; Construction industry; Ethical aspects; Industry; Management; Social aspects; Australia; Corrupt actions; Design/methodology/approach; Face-to-face interview; Organizational cultures; Perceived behavioural controls; Social implication; Urban regeneration; Crime",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937428202

Design/methodology/approach To do this, a secondary analysis is undertaken of the results of the UK Global Entrepreneurship Monitor in general, and UK Social Entrepreneurship Monitor more particularly. It compares the levels and ratios of commercial–to–social entrepreneurship across various population groups and areas in the UK. Findings The finding is that there are different cultures of entrepreneurship across varying population groups. Many marginalized groups are more socially–orientated than profit–driven. This is particularly the case amongst the long–term registered disabled (2.3 times more likely to engage in social rather than commercial entrepreneurship than the average UK entrepreneur), other non–White groups (2.2 times more likely) and the retired (twice as likely). Similarly, people living in rural areas display a greater propinquity to engage in social rather than commercial entrepreneurship than those living in urban areas. Research limitations/implications The findings raise questions about whether it is appropriate to parachute into some populations a culture of commercial entrepreneurship that might be “foreign” to their enterprise culture and whether a focus on social entrepreneurship in the enterprise culture agenda will promote greater inclusiveness of populations traditionally under–represented.

However, the nature of, and reasons for, inappropriate hospitalisations within a palliative care context is under-explored. Aim: To explore the opinions of 'generalist' palliative care providers regarding the nature of, and reasons for, inappropriate admissions among hospital inpatients with palliative care needs. Design: Qualitative study with data collected via individual interviews and focus groups. Setting/participants: Participants (n = 41) comprised 'generalist' palliative care providers working in acute hospital and community settings. Setting: One District Health Board in an urban area of New Zealand. Results: The majority of participants discussed 'appropriateness' in relation to their own understanding of a good death, which typically involved care being delivered in a 'homely' environment, from known people. Differing attitudes among cultural groups were also evident. The following reasons for inappropriate admissions were identified: family carers being unable to cope, the 'rescue culture' of modern medicine, the financing and availability of community services and practice within aged residential care. Conclusions: On the basis of our findings, we recommend a shift to the term 'potentially avoidable' admission rather than 'inappropriate admission'. We also identify an urgent need for debate regarding the role of the acute hospital within a palliative care context. Interventions to reduce hospital admissions within this population must target societal understandings of death and dying within the context of medicalisation, as well as take into account cultural and ethnic diversity in attitudes, if they are to be successful. © The Author(s) 2012.","culture; Hospitalisation; hospitals; palliative care; terminal care","article; cultural anthropology; general practitioner; grounded theory; health personnel attitude; hospital admission; human; indigenous people; New Zealand; nonverbal communication; palliative therapy; qualitative research; quantitative study; residential care; social care; social psychology; social welfare; terminal care; urban area; culture; Hospitalisation; hospitals; palliative care; terminal care; Attitude of Health Personnel; Culture; Focus Groups; Health Services Misuse; Hospitalization; Humans; New Zealand; Palliative Care; Patient Admission; Qualitative Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881541735

Although recent scholarship has persuasively demonstrated the classroom potential of hip-hop texts for promoting student engagement, scaffolding sanctioned forms of knowledge, and nurturing critical consciousness and activism, little work has been done to unpack the complex relations of power that emerge in such classrooms. In particular, we know very little about the ways in which students and teachers are (re)positioned within classrooms that engage in hip-hopcentered pedagogy. This article contributes to the current literature in hip-hop based education, culturally relevant pedagogy, and critical pedagogy by examining the some of the issues and tensions that emerge when teachers engage in hip-hop-centered classroom pedagogy. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study details how the articulation of personal narratives within Hip-Hop Lit, a hip-hop-centered high school English literature course, produced a practice of ""wounded healing,"" in which people bearing the scars of suffering shared their stories in ways that provided a form of release and relief for themselves and others. This article highlights the complex relationships that students forged with the course's hip-hop texts, many of which resonated with their own lived experiences. I then illustrate how these relationships enabled the classroom discussions and interactions from which the practices of wounded healing emerged. Finally, I highlight some of the dilemmas and tensions that emerged as my coteacher and I attempted to privilege the stories and experiences of our students and ourselves within the classroom. Setting: Data for this study were collected at ""Howard High School,"" a small comprehensive urban high school in the northeastern United States. Research Design: Data for this 1-year ethnography were collected using field notes, formal and informal interviews, document analysis, and video data. Conclusions/Recommendations: This article shows how Hip-Hop Lit operated as a space in which members offered and responded to various types of individual and group narratives through the practice of ""wounded healing."" Through this practice, students were able to recognize the commonality of their experiences, challenge various ideologies, and produce new knowledge. In doing this, the members of the class forged a cohesive community replete with multiple roles and relations of power. This article points to the need for critically interrogating the ostensible virtues of hip-hop-based education, as well as critical and culturally relevant pedagogies more broadly. This article also underscores the need for more ethnographic research that unpacks the complexities, contours, and contradictions of curricula, and pedagogy that responds to the lived experiences of students.

STUDY DESIGN: Forty-four in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with a reputational sample of key informants including Aboriginal people resident in remote communities, community elders and religious leaders, doctors, nurses and allied health care providers working in First Nations Communities, as well as specialist service providers in Winnipeg. Thematic qualitative analysis was done on the data collected. Data collected from interviews with northern physicians and nurses was coded and analyzed. RESULTS: Currently, many Aboriginal people living in remote communities are transported to large urban centers to die, isolated from friends, family and their culture. However, the majority of Aboriginal people and health care providers interviewed reported that Aboriginal people living in remote communities would prefer to die at home. The issues surrounding palliative care provision in remote Aboriginal communities are cultural and geographic. Culturally sensitive care requires that patients have access to family supports and traditional services if requested. Geographic isolation requires that: 1. patient-specific care plans be created for use in the remote community; 2. effective lines of communication are established between remote health care providers and urban specialists; 3. health care providers and family care-givers be properly trained to fill their respective roles; and 4. appropriate guidelines and resources be available in the community to support this type of care. CONCLUSIONS: Providing the equipment, supports and education necessary for home-based palliative care in remote Aboriginal communities can be an effective way of addressing the medical, psycho-social, and spiritual needs of these patients.",,"American Indian; article; attitude to health; Canada; death; health care delivery; health service; home care; human; methodology; neoplasm; palliative therapy; psychological aspect; rural population; traditional medicine; utilization review; Death; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services, Indigenous; Home Care Services; Humans; Indians, North American; Manitoba; Medicine, Traditional; Neoplasms; Palliative Care; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542425827

However, progress from pilots to large-scale implementation has hitherto been slow. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to empirically and in-depth investigate how, and to what extent, different factors affect the development and implementation of MaaS. A framework was developed, with a basis in institutional theory and the postulation that formal as well informal factors on different analytical levels (macro, meso and micro) must be considered. The research was organised as a multiple case study in Finland and Sweden and a qualitative approach was chosen for data collection and analysis. A number of factors with a claimed impact on the development and implementation of MaaS was revealed. At the macro level, these factors included legislation concerning transport, innovation and public administration, and the presence (or not) of a shared vision for MaaS. At the meso level, (the lack of) appropriate business models, cultures of collaboration, and assumed roles and responsibilities within the MaaS ecosystem were identified as significant factors. At the micro level, people's attitudes and habits were recognised as important factors to be considered. However, how the ‘S’ in MaaS fits (or not) the transport needs of the individual/household appears to play a more important role in adoption or rejection of MaaS than what has often been acknowledged in previous papers on MaaS. The findings presented in this paper provide several implications for public and private sector actors. Law-making authorities can facilitate MaaS developments by adjusting relevant regulations and policies such as transport-related subsidies, taxation policies and the definition of public transport. Regional and local authorities could additionally contribute to creating conducive conditions for MaaS by, for example, planning urban designs and transport infrastructures to support service-based travelling. Moreover, private actors have key roles to play in future MaaS developments, as both public and private transport services are needed if MaaS is to become a viable alternative to privately owned cars. Thus, the advance of MaaS business models that benefit all involved actors is vital for the prosperity of the emerging MaaS ecosystem. © 2019 The Authors","Barriers; Enablers; Formal institutions; Informal institutions; MaaS; Mobility-as-a-Service","Ecosystems; Public administration; Taxation; Barriers; Enablers; Institutional theory; MaaS; Public and private sector; Qualitative approach; Regulations and policy; Transport infrastructure; Urban transportation; private sector; public sector; public transport; qualitative analysis; transportation infrastructure; transportation system; urban design; Finland; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072540643

We aimed to combine genomic, spatial, and epidemiological data to describe the dynamics of tuberculosis in an urban setting with large numbers of migrants. Methods: We did a population-based study of culture-positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Songjiang, Shanghai. We used whole-genome sequencing to discriminate apparent genetic clusters of M tuberculosis sharing identical variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) patterns, and analysed the relations between proximity of residence and the risk of genomically clustered M tuberculosis. Finally, we used genomic, spatial, and epidemiological data to estimate time of infection and transmission links among migrants and residents. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2015, 1620 cases of culture-positive tuberculosis were recorded, 1211 (75%) of which occurred among internal migrants. 150 (69%) of 218 people sharing identical VNTR patterns had isolates within ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of at least one other strain, consistent with recent transmission of M tuberculosis. Pairs of strains collected from individuals living in close proximity were more likely to be genetically similar than those from individuals who lived far away—for every additional km of distance between patients' homes, the odds that genotypically matched strains were within ten SNPs of each other decreased by about 10% (OR 0·89 [95% CI 0·87–0·91]; p<0·0001). We inferred that transmission from residents to migrants occurs as commonly as transmission from migrants to residents, and we estimated that more than two-thirds of migrants in genomic clusters were infected locally after migration. Interpretation: The primary mechanism driving local incidence of tuberculosis in urban centres is local transmission between both migrants and residents. Combined analysis of epidemiological, genomic, and spatial data contributes to a richer understanding of local transmission dynamics and should inform the design of more effective interventions.

The paper takes a disciplinary perspective of urban informatics and presents five core constituents of the HCI design framework to encourage sustainable food culture in the city via ubiquitous technologies: the perspective of transdisciplinarity; the domains of interest of people, place, and technology; and the perspective of design. © 2010 ACM.","Design; Food; HCI; Sustainability; Transdisciplinarity; Urban informatics","Food; HCI; Informatics; Sustainability; Transdisciplinarity; Design; Information science; Knowledge management; Population statistics; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650092900

These designs have been underused in Africa, where recent urbanization has created many situations in which nearby communities of common ethnicity and culture live under different social and economic circumstances. The International Study of Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB) conducted several overlapping surveys in Nigeria starting in 1993. These surveys were based primarily in the rural village of Idere and the urban community of Idikan, both inhabited by people defined ethnically as Oyo Yoruba and sharing a common language and culture. Survey teams collected standardized blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, and some study participants provided 24-hr urine samples and questionnaire data on psychosocial stress and social integration. Rural and urban groups differed substantially in blood pressure and related characteristics. Age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) for participants aged 25 years and older was 7-8% in Idere and 24-27% in Idikan. The distributions of overweight, sodium/potassium ratio, perceived stress, and social integration scores all contributed to lower hypertension risk in Idere. The effects and interactions of these identified risk factors remain poorly understood, even among people who share a common genetic background, similar diet, and many other lifestyle features. Nonetheless, the rural-urban distinction is sufficiently salient to engender a nearly threefold difference in hypertension prevalence. This disparity in disease prevalence demonstrates the sensitivity of human beings to the environmental determinants of disease and provides a sobering example of the difficulty in identifying subtle genetic effects, which can be easily overwhelmed by small differences in environmental exposures.","Africa; Anthropometry; Blood pressure; Nigeria; Social factors","adult; aged; article; blood pressure; comparative study; female; follow up; human; hypertension; male; middle aged; Negro; Nigeria; physiology; prevalence; risk factor; urbanization; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Pressure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Nigeria; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Urbanization; Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033180302

Comparative data were available on five types of harm: physical abuse, damage of clothes/belongings, verbal abuse, being afraid, and being kept awake at night.Results: This study shows that harms from other’s drinking are commonly experienced in all six countries. Being kept awake at night is the most com-mon harm, while being physically harmed is the least common. The proportions that reported at least one of the five problems were highest in Finland and Iceland and lowest in Norway, but also relatively low in Sweden. Across countries, the level of harm was highest among young, single, urban residents, and for some countries among women and those who frequently drank to intoxication themselves.Conclusioions: The study revealed large differences in the prevalence of harm in countries with fairly similar drinking cultures. However, the correlates of such experiences were similar across countries.

While such planning designs have been quite successful in maintaining a physical distinction between rural and urban, major transformations of the socio-economic environment in peri-urban areas are creating a more diffuse and porous interface. This paper examines socio-economic consequences of the current transformation of peri-urban areas. Three themes are selected for analysis: changing economies, overall impact of urbanisation as perceived by the individual farm owner and the degree of their local orientation and engagement. Based on case studies in Greater Copenhagen, longitudinal trends and details of the current situation are analysed. In addition, by differentiating between newcomers and long-term residents, possible future changes are indicated. The analysis shows that the importance of agriculture has declined, whereas other gainful activities and residential use have increased. Thus, the functions of the local economy and community are changing. An increasing proportion of the farm owners appreciate the proximity to urban agglomerations (public services, shopping, public transport, social relationships and markets), but this location also has drawbacks, for example in terms of uncertainty concerning future urban development, inconveniences for agricultural production and problems related to public access to private properties. Differences between newcomers and long-time residents are identified. Newcomers without any agricultural background are frequent. They often work outside the municipality and are more frequently personally involved in other gainful activities on-farm. Newcomers perceive more problems related to people accessing the farm properties and are less involved in local activities. In combination, these trends indicate possible future increase in conflicts between farm owners and the public and that the local engagement may be declining. The analysis, however, also shows similarities between newcomers and long-time residents, and therefore does not indicate the development of two cultures or ""two nations"". Rather, the urban fringe population is becoming more heterogeneous, ranging from full-time farmers to residents with their social and professional network outside the local area or people engaging in non-agricultural business on-farm. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 1,000 urban young adults in five Asian countries (HK, China, Indonesia, Thailand and India) were telephone interviewed on their thoughts about the TV advertisement/s that they liked, product that was being advertised and purchase intention. Their responses were summarised into seven likeable executional techniques and product categories. Findings - There is not a specific likeable executional technique that influences a purchase in four of the five countries. India is the only country where significant but weak overall model fit observed. These results demonstrate that, while there are differences among the countries, people in the same cohort broadly share the same values. For product categories, our findings demonstrate that product nature may moderate cultural influence on advertising effectiveness. Practical implications - International advertisers who are vying for a share of the largely-untapped Asian market can benefit by understanding the target country's cultural values and using it as a guideline for creating effective executional techniques in advertising. Originality/value - This study extends the existing knowledge which demonstrates that, in Asia, persuasive executional techniques differ depending on the product category. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advertising; Culture; Far East; South Asia; South East Asia; Young adults",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748903469

Methods: Data were analyzed using an ethnographic approach. Group summaries were compiled and community-level patterns were identified. Findings: Four patterns were identified that encompassed the influences of (a) Ojibwe and mainstream cultures (traditions), (b) communication-related barriers from a variety of sources (mixed messages), (c) socioeconomic issues (life circumstances) and (d) social support (nurturing and supporting).

Design/methodology/approach – Seven focus groups were conducted. A total of 51 people, aged 19-70 years, participated in the study. Theoretical thematic analysis was used to organise the data as various themes emerged. Findings – Through application of neutralisation theory, this study identified additional barriers to green consumption. Two new neutralisation techniques emerged, namely protecting (maintaining) one’s sense of self and consumer attachment to the brand. These techniques recognise the impact consumer culture has had on consumers. Research limitations/implications – The study took place in an urban centre hence the views of the participants may be different from those who live in rural centres; low-income consumers were under-represented; and more male participants would have been desirable. Social implications – Despite its limitations, this study reveals that consumers will rationalise their decisions in order to protect their self-esteem and self-identity. Until green becomes a social norm, consumers will continue to place individual goals over collective goals. Understanding this rationalisation process is important if marketers and policy makers want to encourage behavioural change. Originality/value – This study makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of the green attitudebehaviour gap. It provides fresh insights into how environmentally conscious consumers vindicate their non-green consumption behaviours and how marketers and policy makers can overcome these challenges. It also identifies two new neutralisation techniques and extends the theory to a consumer culture context. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Green marketing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937869283

At the center of the debate over the years is the extent to which school desegregation is a matter of class or race, of redistribution or recognition. A cultural political economy of school desegregation begins with a rejection of the popular notion that desegregation is simply, or even primarily, about race. It also eschews the idea that what is needed is a ""corrective interjec- "" tion of social class and economic justice. In proposing neither a racial nor an economic solution, cultural political economy sheds doubt on the very proposition of a ""racial"" or ""economic"" analysis, politics, or remedy and helps us more powerfully explain how the cultural and material force of race and class breathes as one through the historical-political trajectory of school desegregation. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article is based on findings from a larger historical-ethnographic research project intended to explicate the cultural-ideological and structural context(s) within which Seattle's Black leaders, educators, and activists made sense of the relationship between school desegregation and the lives and liberation of Black people in the post-civil-rights era. Here, the author uses cultural political economy as an analytical framework to elucidate the relationship(s) between cultural productions such as the construction of rights, justice, and racial progress, and political-economic formations such as the (ab)use of the state and market by certain classes - in this case, middle-class and affluent White Seattleites - to preserve their own privilege through the implementation of social and educational policies that serve to reproduce material inequities. Setting : The study setting is Seattle, Washington. Population/Participants: Black leaders, educators, and activists who participated in the school desegregation struggle in the city of Seattle from the mid-1970s through 2007. Research Design: This study employed semistructured ethnographic interviews, content analysis, and historical/archival analysis. Conclusion/Recommendations: The trajectory of school desegregation politics in Seattle, culminating in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, reveals a long and systematic political effort to delegitimize and dismantle justice-oriented redistribution of educational resources along racial lines. Cultural political economy provides an analytical framework that contributes to our theoretical understanding of the interimbrication of culture and political economy in education politics and policy-making. The author argues that understanding the interimbrication of class and race in the politics of school desegregation allows us to more clearly theorize how school desegregation policies are undermined in ways that reproduce material and cultural relations of power. Ultimately, critical researchers, educators, and youth and community activists must develop political strategies to shift the very relations of power highlighted in the Seattle case.

A great attention is paid to the ICTs while ignoring the social aspect. With the immersive invasion of internet as well as smartphones' applications and digital social networking, people become more socially connected through virtual spaces instead of meeting in physical public spaces. ICTs are categorized in this paper into four elements which are as follows: Wi-Fi networks, digital interactive media façades, interactive public displays, and smartphones' applications in public spaces. These elements will play major roles in the public space classified into five domains which are as follows: Culture and art, education, planning and design, games and entertainment, and information and communication. Based on this classification various examples and proposals of ICTs interventions in public spaces are presented to encourage good old fashioned social interaction by creating the new social public place of this digital era.

Following an introduction, the first section introduces the tensions which the designs and practices of programs in these fields are called upon to negotiate, and the experimentation in both fields which reaches towards more participative and 'people-centered' ways of working. I illustrate the challenges and potentials for such transformations through two cases of energetic civil society governance activity, one (from north east England) where old social democratic practices have lived on, and another (from central Japan) where more participative practices centered on people's daily life concerns have evolved. I then outline a conception of a participative, pluralistic, richly-informed, people-centered polity, drawing on older contrasts between elite and participative forms of democracy. I argue that, in current times in countries such as the UK, the new forms of 'network governance' which are appearing within and around the long-established designs and practices of representative democracy hold a potential for more people-centered forms to emerge.

To explore perspectives of health care professionals and female Somali and Bangladeshi Muslim women on practices related to fasting during Ramadan, the impact of fasting on health and the role of health professionals during Ramadan. Design. A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted. Two culturally specific focus groups were conducted with six Somali and seven Bangladeshi Muslim women who observed Ramadan and lived in an inner-city neighbourhood of Toronto, Canada. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 health care professionals practicing in this inner-city area (three of whom were Muslim). Data were analysed using thematic qualitative analysis. Results. Both Muslim women and health care professionals recognised the spiritual significance of the Ramadan fast. Muslim participants considered the fast to be beneficial to health overall, whereas health care professionals tended to reflect on health concerns from fasting. Many health care professionals were not fully aware of fasting practices during Ramadan and some found it challenging to counsel patients about the health effects of fasting. Muslim women expressed disagreement regarding which medical interventions were permitted during fasting. They generally agreed that health care professionals should not specifically advise against fasting, but instead provide guidance on health maintenance while fasting. Both groups agreed that guidelines developed by the health care and faith communities together would be useful. Conclusion. There are a variety of health beliefs and observances among female Muslim Somali and Bangladeshi women and a range of knowledge, experience and opinions among health care professionals related to fasting during Ramadan and health. Overall, there is a need for improved communication between members of the Muslim community and health professionals in Canada about health issues related to fasting during Ramadan. Strategies could include published practice guidelines endorsed by the Muslim community; patient education materials developed in collaboration with health and religious experts; or further qualitative research to help professionals understand the beliefs and observances of Muslim people. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","culture; fasting; general practice; primary care; qualitative research; Ramadan","cultural influence; data interpretation; ethnicity; fasting; health impact; qualitative analysis; womens health; adult; aged; article; attitude to health; Bangladesh; Canada; cross-sectional study; diet restriction; ethnology; female; health care personnel; health status; human; information processing; interview; leisure; middle aged; professional standard; psychological aspect; religion; Somalia; urban population; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Health; Bangladesh; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fasting; Female; Focus Groups; Health Personnel; Health Status; Holidays; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Islam; Middle Aged; Ontario; Professional Role; Somalia; Spirituality; Urban Population; Bangladesh; Canada; Ethiopia; Ontario [Canada]; Somali; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951565579

We describe a method we used to develop a questionnaire to tap symptoms of psychiatric distress, and which would be geared to the realities of place and setting. By means of a factor analysis of the responses to this questionnaire by more than 400 subjects, we identify four dimensions by which the Serer express neurotic disturbance. Further analyses presented in the report demonstrate that these are not merely ways of expressing symptoms based on physical illness, that they are able to discriminate between ill and well people in the Serer frame of reference, that they possess domain validity, and that they demonstrate important similarities and differences with factors obtained using similar techniques in different cultural settings.

The focus on culture and history as factors in regional transformation has been particularly extensive in response not only to competitiveness among cities but also to sustainability requirements in the cultural sector. In the same perspective of this approach, culture in its broadest sense assumes a decisive role in constructing a system of interventions where employment and social and sustainable development become the product of the integration of places, people, economies and traditions. Creative cities are currently working on how to improve the interaction between regeneration building, economic development and social renewal in order to achieve more comprehensive development of the city. Existing creative cities may be seen to revolve around the design, promotion and activation of urban areas established due to their particular local characteristics. Such areas become creative clusters as a result of economic and structural innovations, related to the realization of innovator projects achieved with the help of local development strategies based on the economies of excellence, culture and territorial quality. Starting from such premises, this article aims to show the main factors which condition creativity in cities - such as new policies, participation, history, place identity, cultural resources and sustainability - and an emblematic case study of creative regeneration. This concerns the HafenCity district in Hamburg, where the history has assumed an important role in re-constructing the maritime identity and for many choices of urban nature. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","attractivity; creative urban regeneration; cultural resources; economic development; innovation; participation; place identity; social renewal; sustainability; urban history","cultural economy; development strategy; sustainability; urban area; urban history; urban planning; urban renewal; waterfront development; Germany; Hamburg [Germany]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890778659

Older people are being encouraged to be physically active for as long as possible as a preventive measure against disease and functional decline. It remains, however, uncertain how living in a retirement community affects physical activity (PA). Objectives. This study was conducted to understand the PA experiences of older women living in retirement communities and what they experience as facilitators of and barriers to PA. Design. The study was qualitative and guided by the Vancouver School of doing phenomenology, a unique blend of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and constructivism. Method. Participants were 10 women, aged from 72 to 97 years (mean=84 years). In-depth interviews were conducted, recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Results. A model was constructed with 3 main themes: (1) the women themselves, including their experienced health condition, individual aspects of functioning, and various personal factors; (2) the physical environment; and (3) the social environment. These main themes all include subthemes of experienced influences on PA, such as health, design of housing and environment, and local culture. These influences could both facilitate and hinder PA, depending on the context. The facilitating effects of good outdoor areas, accessible physical training facilities, a familiar neighborhood, and finding joy in PA were clear in the study. The barriers included worsening health, a colder climate with ice and wind, and lack of a PA culture within the retirement community. Conclusions. An older woman's residence may strongly influence her ability and motivation to be physically active. Physical therapists should acquaint themselves with the facilitators of and barriers to PA of women within retirement communities and use that knowledge to influence the physical and social environment and to target PA interventions to the women themselves. © 2012 American Physical Therapy Association.",,"aged; article; attitude to health; Canada; demography; female; human; interview; motor activity; psychological aspect; reproducibility; retirement; social environment; urban population; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude to Health; British Columbia; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Motor Activity; Reproducibility of Results; Residence Characteristics; Retirement; Social Environment; Urban Population; Women",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859203206

This research aims at discovering and thus better understanding what Chinese consumers value most among their possessions. In turn, this finding should help better understand the contemporary Chinese culture. Design/methodology/approach: The general research approach utilized in this effort is qualitative. All data were collected through at-home, in-depth personal interviews, following established guidelines outlined by Lincoln and Guba, and Wallendorf and Belk. A snowball sampling resulted in the participation of 20 rural and 20 urban households. Findings: Participants' demographic profile ended up matching well the national profile in terms of income, and the gender and age make-up of the rural and urban samples were not significantly different. Four categories emerged to comprehensively represent all the favorite products identified by the participants: entertainment, functional, hedonic, and mementos. In addition, a numerically significant number of participants could neither think of a favorite product nor possess one. As developed in the paper, conventional typologies, such as Hofstede and Triandis' collectivism-individualism do not account well for the results observed in this study. Rather, the study turns towards Lu's research and suggestion that using instruments developed by Western cultures suffer from methodological defects when applied to Chinese behaviors. This research then defines the Yi, a Confucian value related to benevolence, morality, righteousness, and the Li, a Mohist/Legalist value related to utilitarianism and profit, and suggests that the two better help understand the findings and support observations. Research limitations/implications: The nature of qualitative research clearly limits the generalization of its findings, and therefore to offer more definitive results, future efforts would have to consider other methods. Also, and while great care is taken to ensure the validity of the data collection process, there is always the possibility that some respondents may not have been as candid or truthful as would be hoped. However, and altogether, findings from this research do match well what public media have often been reporting, and what frequent casual observations point out. Practical implications: China's contemporary culture is rapidly changing, somehow breaking away from traditions, yet retaining core values and reshaping them with modern, sometimes alien inputs. This research clearly indicates what motivates the younger generations, raised in a nation governed by an all-controlling Communist party that orchestrates an openly capitalistic, materialistic societal development. Such apparent contradictions, the result of ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics,"" may be puzzling to some in the Western world but are not so with today's Chinese consumers. Originality/value: This research is unique in its topic and research approach, given that it deals with Chinese consumers, the largest block of consumers in the world. It offers a perspective, not yet considered within the marketing and consumer research literature, that seems to explain well what is observed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","China; Collectivism; Consumer behaviour; Consumers; Individual behaviour; National cultures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749399893

Here, the authors broaden their critique, exploring the cultural implications of car design, and how cars might be used more effectively to promote mobility while reducing their impact on the urban environment. They argue that conventional fantasies of freedom, speed and power on which the outward form of the modern automobile is presently based, are inappropriate during a period of growing congestion, urban traffic blight, climate change and diminishing fuel resources. The role and function of the automobile must change, and this in turn implies a change in 'car culture'. Certain processes are already at work, which will assist change in the proposed direction independently of what people actually want. The authors propose additionally a reshaping of the external form of the private car to reflect a new and more environmentally appropriate role, helping, we suggest, to decouple its image from outworn fantasies, and bringing it into the public realm as a more sociable apparatus for modern living. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The first concerns the legitimacy of architectural practice: can we be assertive about how we should design our cities without seeking to enforce social assumptions which are ultimately authoritarian? The second concerns architectural theory itself: can we be specific about what architecture does without being reductive about what society is? This article identifies and criticizes two kinds of recent responses to these questions: the first is to defend an architecture of localism and containment in some new and some old ways; the second is to retreat into relativism, sometimes supported by the assertion that architecture is of limited consequence because society is increasingly independent of space. The article defends the view that we can and must be assertive about the architecture of cities in global rather than local terms. The experience of genuinely urban environments is about meeting, though not necessarily interacting with, other people, mostly unknown, who can be of recognizably different class, status, race or ethnic origin; it is also about exploring the strange, and becoming aware of, though not necessarily participating in, other ways of life. -from Author",,"architecture; city design; environmental experience; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024895479

First, this is done by identifying how status transitions (vertical movements) overlap but differ in some important respects from identity transitions (horizontal movements), and second, the consumption strategies used by people when these movements lead to an experience of conflict between one's (new/old) identity role and (new/old) status position have been demonstrated. Design/methodology/approach: In this multi-sited, qualitative data collection, the phenomenological and ethnographic interviews have been conducted with 35 urban middle-class consumers in their homes at three culturally and historically different sites (Sweden, Turkey and the USA). Findings: The importance and kind of a consumption strategy to resolve the status-identity incongruence relates if it is mainly a vertically or horizontally determined transition. To consumers with a main focus on status change - characterised by hierarchical and competitive dimensions that identity role transitions are free from - the engagement in consumption becomes more important and intense. Practical implications: Marketers have historically mainly been engaged in static categorisation and segmentation of consumer lifestyles. By instead emphasising consumers' life transitions and their accompanying status-identity conflicts, marketers may consider the implications for market communication. Social implications: Given that liquid modernity (Bauman, 2001) and its loose social structures forces the middle-class to become increasingly socially mobile, matches and mismatches between identity and status positions ought to become more common and the resulting consumption strategies more sophisticated. This research offers a first, tentative framework for understanding these conflicts in relation to consumption. Originality/value: Although lifestyle transitions have often been elaborated on in consumer research, the differences between social status transitions and identity transitions, and especially the conflict in-between these two, have not been paid its deserved attention. Based on multi-sited, qualitative data collection, concrete consumption strategies following the experience of status-identity incongruence have been identified. The results also contribute to a better understanding of the growing uncertainty and volatility of social status positions in contemporary middle-class consumer culture. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer culture; Consumption; Identity; Incongruence; Social status; Transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940297553

These emergent principles focus on the conceptualization and uses of technology in science learning environments designed for urban Indigenous youth.

Recent estimates project that the year 2000 there will be 590 million people aged 60 or older worldwide. Of these 590 million approximately 61% will be living in lesser developed countries. Thus, these countries will shortly face critical decisions concerning the impact of these aging populations on state plans for economic development. China, the country with the largest anticipated number of elderly in the world provides an instructive case of how one developing country is attempting to balance the needs of the elderly with those of the union as a whole. In particular the rapid aging of the Chinese population has prompted official concern about the financial implications of providing health care to increasing numbers of disabled or frail elderly. This paper reports the effort of one study to determine the extent of disability and frailty among the urban elderly and the strategies they and their family members have develope to cope with it. The research was conducted between June 1987 and January 1988 in two neighborhoods of Canton, the capital of Guangdong Province. Two hundred household, each containing at least one member 70 years of age or older, were randomly selected from household registration lists. In each household a 1-2 hr interview was conducted with the elder (or, in the case of those too disabled to participate, proxy) on the following topics: personal background, proximity andcontact with kin, household composition and organization, health and functionality, use of medical services, work history, income sources, daily activities, and attitudes regarding intergenerational relations. The paper is divided into five parts addressing the following topics: (1) China and research on aging, (2) comparative data-problematic aspects, (3) methodological issues to consider when investigating disability, (4) the findings of the study, and (5) the significance of ideological, environmental, and political factors in mediating the experience of age-associated disability in China. © 1991.","aging; China; disability; family caregiving; health care","ageing population; cultural issue; developing country; disability; disability prevalence; elderly people; family care; health care; urban population; China; China, Guangdong Province, Canton; aged; aging; article; china; developing country; disability; female; health care; human; interview; male; normal human; research; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case Report; China; Culture; Family; Female; Frail Elderly; Geriatric Assessment; Health Services for the Aged; Health Services Needs and Demand; Home Nursing; Housing; Human; Male; Research Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0025925514

The main disadvantage of active transport (in particular walking) for most people compared to private motorised transport is the limited range. Public transport (PT) can complement the use of active modes and extend their range. Therefore, there might be potential to increase physical activity through an increase in PT use. This article takes a closer look at how walking relates to the use of PT by examining existing literature on the topic. It aims to study how far people walk to and from PT and what key factors influence this. Scopus, Transport Research International Documentation and Web of Science have been searched systematically for relevant articles, conference papers and books. After screening of titles and abstracts, 41 relevant publications were identified. Studies were included if they quantified the amount of walking (measured as either distance or time) that is directly related to the use of PT. Studies that quantified walking using general measures of daily physical activity or daily walking or that used stated preference designs were excluded. The PT systems considered in this paper are mass transport systems in urban areas, either road- or rail-based, with fixed schedules and stops. Demand responsive transport services, which can offer door-to-door travel, are not considered, as these systems can to a large extent eliminate the need to walk. In the identified publications, a large variety of walking distances and times have been reported, and these seem to be highly context-specific. The paper establishes the evidence for the wide range of factors that influence walking related to PT, which have been categorised as personal, PT-related, environmental, and journey-related. The different methods that have been used are discussed by critically analysing their advantages and limitations. Only a limited number of these methods used allow for an accurate assessment of the walking distances to and from PT. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research, such as a need for more accurate measurement of walking and research in different geographical areas to shed light on underlying influences of culture and climate. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","access; egress; physical activity; public transport; Walking","accessibility; future prospect; physical activity; public transport; transportation mode; transportation system; travel behavior; travel demand; walking; Scopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061096777

Aims: To study the microbiological etiology and epidemiological factors associated with suppurative keratitis. Settings and Design: A total of 150 corneal scrapings were evaluated from patients presenting with corneal ulcers at a tertiary ophthalmology center, Ahmedabad from July 2007 to June 2008. Materials and Methods: Scrapings were subjected to Gram stain, potassium hydroxide preparation and culture for bacterial and fungal pathogens. Socio-demographic data and risk factors were recorded. Results: Ninety percent (135/150) people with corneal ulcers had trauma as predisposing factor for keratitis. Trauma due to wooden objects was the leading cause (46/135) followed by vegetable matter and stone injury (23/135). Microbial etiology was established in 59.3% (89/150) of scrapings. Out of 89 positive isolates, 65.1% (58/89) were bacterial while 34.9% (31/89) were fungal. Among the bacterial isolates, 60.3% (35/58) were Gram-positive cocci while 39.7% (23/58) were Gram-negative bacilli. The most common bacterial isolate was Staphylococus aureus (32.7%, 19/58) followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococci (25.8%, 15/58) and Pseudomonas (18.9%, 11/58). Among the 31 fungal pathogens, Aspergillus species was the most common (35.4%11/31), followed by Fusarium species (22.5%, 7/31). Conclusion: Trauma with wooden material is the most common predisposing factor for suppurative keratitis. Males were more affected than females. Bacterial ulcers were more common than fungal in areas in and around Ahmedabad. Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus were the commonest bacterial and fungal isolates respectively. Geographical variation persists in microbial etiology of suppurative keratitis.","Microbial etiology; mucopurulent keratitis; suppurative keratitis","acoustic microscopy; adult; age distribution; article; bacterial eye infection; bacterium; comparative study; cornea; female; fungal eye infection; fungus; human; incidence; India; isolation and purification; keratitis; male; microbiology; middle aged; pathology; retrospective study; urban population; Adult; Age Distribution; Bacteria; Cornea; Eye Infections, Bacterial; Eye Infections, Fungal; Female; Fungi; Humans; Incidence; India; Keratitis; Male; Microscopy, Acoustic; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Urban Population; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864442529

In this study, a year-long thermal comfort field survey was conducted in rural folk houses in 11 rural areas in the Guangdong Province, the hot-humid area of southern China. The subjective responses of residents were recorded via questionnaires, and all ambient environment parameters were measured. The results show that air speed was greater and relative humidity was lower in the semi-open spaces. The clothing insulation of the survey respondents varied with indoor operative temperatures from 0.27 clo to 1.2 clo during the non-summer season and remained steady at 0.30 clo during the summer season. The thermal neutral, acceptable and preferred indoor operative temperatures were determined for the interior and semi-open spaces in the summer and non-summer. Compared to those of the interior spaces, the thermal neutral temperature was 0.6–1.3 °C lower and the upper limit of 80% acceptable temperature was decreased by 0.8–4.7 °C in the semi-open spaces. The acceptable temperature in the summer for the rural residents was found to be 0.2–1 °C higher than that of the urban residents in the same climate. Psychological factors such as local culture, expectations and perceived control might be the reasons for these differences.

We assessed the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in the Xinjiang province, China, 10 years after introduction of a control programme based on directly observed treatment, short course. Methods: In this population-based, cross-sectional survey, we used a multistage stratified random cluster sample design to estimate the prevalence of smear-positive and bacteriologically confirmed (either smear positive or culture positive, or both) pulmonary tuberculosis among adults (aged ≥15 years) in Xinjiang who had been resident in their household for the last 6 months. The screening strategy and diagnosis followed WHO guidelines. We estimated prevalence by combining inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation of missing data. We compared our prevalence survey estimates with the ones from the 2010 China national pulmonary tuberculosis survey and the ones from a provincial pulmonary survey done in Xinjiang in 2000. The new smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis notification rate in 2011 in Xinjiang was obtained to allow the calculation of patient diagnosis rate (PDR). Findings: Between Sept 1, 2010, and July 31, 2011, 31 081 individuals were eligible, of whom 29 835 (96·0%) participated in the survey. We identified 50 (0·2%) smear-positive and 101 (0·3%) bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis cases. The weighted prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 170 (95% CI 103-233) per 100 000 people and of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 430 (249-611) per 100 000 people. Compared with 2000 Xinjiang survey estimates, the prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis has decreased by 26·4% (from 231 [95% CI 148-314] per 100 000 people), whereas the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis has increased by 17·8% (from 365 [237-493] per 100 000 people). In each age group and sex, the pulmonary tuberculosis prevalence was higher in the 2010-11 Xinjiang survey than in the 2010 national survey. The PDR in 2011 was 0·34 (95% CI 0·25-0·44). Interpretation: Despite progress in other parts of China, the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Xinjiang remains high. The very low PDR suggests poor access to diagnosis and care. Further studies are needed to understand the barriers to diagnosis and care of this population, and efforts are urgently needed to enhance tuberculosis screening in this area.

No longer limited to statues of heroes placed high on pedestals, contemporary memorials engage visitors in new, often surprising ways, contributing to the liveliness of public space. In Memorials as Spaces of Engagement Quentin Stevens and Karen A. Franck explore how changes in memorial design and use have helped forge closer, richer relationships between commemorative sites and their visitors. The authors combine first hand analysis of key examples with material drawn from existing scholarship. Examples from the US, Canada, Australia and Europe include official, formally designed memorials and informal ones, those created by the public without official sanction. Memorials as Spaces of Engagement discusses important issues for the design, management and planning of memorials and public space in general. The book is organized around three topics: how the physical design of memorial objects and spaces has evolved since the 19th century; how people experience and understand memorials through the activities of commemorating, occupying and interpreting; and the issues memorials raise for management and planning. Memorials as Spaces of Engagement will be of interest to architects, landscape architects and artists; historians of art, architecture and culture; urban sociologists and geographers; planners, policymakers and memorial sponsors; and all those concerned with the design and use of public space. © 2016 Taylor and Francis.

Changes associated with urban growth often involve the destruction of built characteristics and natural elements, eradicating the physical expression of former indigenous ways of life that are a very important part of people's culture. This fact was particularly evident after the Second World War, when industrial landscapes faced deep transformations that in several cases contributed to its dereliction and to the disappearance of numerous industrial values, commonly known as industrial heritage. This phenomenon added to the necessity of reusing abandoned industrial landscapes in detriment of consuming new ones, increases the need to enlarge the interpretation of the term ""cultural heritage"", to analyse and interpret the value and significance of post-industrial landscapes and to develop new mechanisms to preserve it. Furthermore, it is increasingly acknowledged that the values connected with culture and heritage are highly significant for people's lives and need to be identified and highlighted. This paper presents a set of design principles that will be applied to the post-industrial landscape of left margin to the Arade River. These principles describe in a general manner the ways in which relevant resources created and deposited by the industrial society can be enhanced and how they can best be reclaimed and used.","Arade river; Culture; Industrial heritage; Landscape reclamation; Sustainable development; Urban redevelopment","culture; heritage conservation; industrial location; sustainable development; urban area; urban development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53549133133

The study surveyed urban park users in the two cities in 2017 to identify and compare the most important factors underpinning the viability of public open spaces from the perspective of users (mental aspect) and the extent to which these mental factors match the visual features of the selected spaces (visual aspect). A random sample of 232 individuals was taken from students in Ardabil (119 persons) and Rasht (113 persons). A considerable part of the participants (37.2%) reported a feeling of tranquility when they saw flowers, while 28.8% of the participants reported a feeling of love. Flower-bearing plant species were more appealing to the participants than leafy ornamental plants. Red was the most preferred flower color (52.1%) followed by violet (18.6%) and orange (11.4%) among the ornamental species commonly used in the design of green spaces, while tulip (Tulipa gesneriana) (29%), rose (Rosa hybrida) (25%), and Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) (19%) were in the first top ranks of preferences, respectively. Coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides) and garden croton (Codiaeum variegatum) were also reported among preferred species. The results support the assumption of similarity in preferences and requirements of citizens of large cities and despite great diversity in geography, culture, and ethics, people in large cities exhibit similar emotion perceptions.

Beyond moral panics little is known about movements, networks, and linkages between custom cars, young enthusiasts, and urban spaces from which their activities emerge. Utilising responsive, in-depth ethnographic methods in Wollongong, Australia, this paper interprets custom-car design as vernacular creativity, valued by young people and located across unassuming and unheralded urban spaces. The possibility that custom-car designers possess skills that are assets for 'blue-collar' industrial cities is contrasted against a backdrop of wider discourses depicting such cities as economically vulnerable, as 'victims' of restructuringöand even 'uncreative'.

Ecological development in China includes the ecological assessment/evaluation, ecological planning/design, ecological engineering and ecological management which require systematically responsible planning, totally functional design and ecologically vivid management. Since several decades of years, different scales of ecological administrative units including ecological county, ecopolis (eco-cities) and ecological provinces have been developed, which indicated that the process of ecological development helps local people to engage in a vision and actions regarding how the urban or regional ecosystems are coupling systematically, vitalizing and functioning ecologically and how the actions are connected with their social, economic and long-term ecological interests. The constructive practice of ecopolis and eco-provinces in China has demonstrated this success.The key instrument for ecological development in China is the eco-integration of total metabolism of material and energy; total cultivation of eco-industry, eco-scape and eco-culture; total coordination of systematic coupling in time, space, quantity, structure and order; total design of developmental goals of wealth, health and faith; total cooperation between decision makers, entrepreneurs, researchers and the public. The special emphasis of China's ecological development has been placed on encouraging bottom-up and flexible actions rather than top-down and rigid institution, and helping local people to help themselves through capacity building. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Eco-county; Ecological engineering; Ecological management; Ecological planning; Ecopolis (eco-city); Social-economic-natural complex ecosystem",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955151634

Aim: To describe efforts to engage communities in systematic and data-based processes of planning, programme design, implementation, and evaluation. Method: Details system-building initiatives in five communities (four counties and a distressed urban site) that will serve as a springboard for full national deployment. Results: Extensive community engagement and planning has occurred in all sites, systems change efforts grounded in detailed business plans have begun, and process and outcome evaluation is underway. Conclusion:Needs and resource assessment processes confirmed the magnitude of need, but also suggested the creative re-allocation of local resources.

Study design: Qualitative study with interviews. Methods: Community and research informants (n=10) were interviewed informally to identify survey topics. A sexual health survey was constructed combining local knowledge from informants with a review of sexual health literature for the Arctic and other Indigenous locations. The draft survey was distributed to community partners for commentary and revision. After translation into Danish and Greenlandic, cognitive interviews were conducted with 11 Nuuk residents, identified through snowball sampling, to both pilot test the survey and exchange social and cultural knowledge relevant to sexual health in Nuuk. The utility of this process was evaluated against implementation of the final survey to Nuuk residents enrolled in Inuulluataarneq (n=149). Results: Theme saturation was reached by the ninth interview. STI risk and self-efficacy, co-occurrence of alcohol use and sex and STI knowledge were identified as most relevant. Questions about community efficacy, culture/community involvement and identity were most sensitive. Upon implementation of the final survey, 146 of 149 participants answered all survey questions. Two Elder participants refused to answer questions about sex. Some questions had low response variability but still added to our contextual understanding and helped to build rapport with participants. Conclusions: Combining an iterative process with community-based participatory research principles and cognitive interview techniques was an effective method for developing a sexual health survey with Nuuk residents.","Aboriginal health; Cultural competency; Knowledge translation; Sexual health; Survey methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77149168498

With the prospect of hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers projected to leave their villages to become industrial workers in new and expanded towns within the next few years, new challenges will be faced. As expansion and modernization progress, this development moves from the traditional village model that operates not far from resource sustainability to increasingly unsustainable patterns of commerce, urban development, and modern life. With such an unprecedented mass migration and transformation, how can Chinese culture survive? What is to become of the existing million plus agricultural villages? How can these massively unsustainable new industrial towns survive? In the European Commission sponsored research program SUCCESS, researchers worked from the scale of the Chinese village to find viable answers to these questions. To address these issues, the Center for Sustainable Cities, one of the SUCCESS teams, studied the metabolism of several small villages. In these studies, system dynamics models of a village's metabolism were created and then modified so that inherently unsustainable means were eliminated from the model (fossil fuels, harmful agricultural chemicals, etc.) and replaced by sustainability-oriented means. Small Chinese farming villages are unlikely to survive in anything like their present form or scale, not least because they are too small to provide the range of life opportunities to which the young generation of educated Chinese aspires. As a response to this realization as well as to the many other threats to the Chinese village and its rural way of life, it was proposed that one viable path into the future would be to enlarge the villages to become full service towns with sufficient diversity of opportunity to be able to attract and keep many of the best and brightest young people who are now migrating to the larger cities. Starting with the village in its sustainability-oriented model form, the village model would be enlarged both quantitatively and qualitatively through many trial iterations. A research program is described whereby an operational definition of the sustainable city is developed as a means of creating these enlarged models through citizen participation assisted by outside experts using software under development called the Sustainability Engine™ to guide the process and provide feedback as to the consequences of various proposals that are brought to the table. As this process is continued, the village would be incrementally enlarged and made more diverse and more complex through a variety of scenarios until it would emerge as a modern, sustainable town or city. In this way, through a participatory, balance-seeking civil society process involving villagers and scientists in what the Center for Sustainable Cities calls the Sustainable City Game, the villages can become the DNA for generating future sustainable Chinese towns and cities. As an extension of this discussion, a new urban model, the Sustainable City-as-a-Hill, is presented that responds to both the qualities of the traditional Chinese village as well as to the modern demands of industrial and post-industrial economies and, in particular, to the need for sustainable urban patterns. In addition a new concept, the Sustainable Area Budget (SAB) is introduced which definitively creates the boundary condition for both modeling the sustainable city and presenting the quest for the sustainable city-region as a coherent, scientific design process. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on research in city and urban planning, which emphasizes the importance of quality of a place, location or city and the more intentional emphasis given to development of human and cultural resources, which are conducive to innovation, learning, creativity and change in a knowledge-based economy. Findings - Singapore is chosen as a case study of analysis for a knowledge-based economy in transition because of its developmental approach and strategic shift from one focused on technology-intensive sectors to one focused on high knowledge-intensive companies and towards a free-spirited dynamic creative hub in the making. It displays many characteristics typical of a knowledge-based economy in which people, their ideas and capabilities are the key sources of wealth and opportunities. Practical implications - The paper observes a missing link in the transition from technology to knowledge to culture hub, which might have implications for Singapore's effort towards establishing itself as a cultural industries metropolis, a renaissance city using culture to re-position its international image as a global city for the arts. Originality/value - The originality and value of the paper lie in this analysis, which makes one conclude that, although Singapore's developmental model had created benefits in many ways, it had also negatively constrained its development, particularly in the area of knowledge creation and application to entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity.","Communication technologies; Culture (sociology); Singapore",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749043989

To explore ethnic variations in drug, tobacco and alcohol use and their correlation with other factors which operate through peer, familial and religious influences. Design. Semi-structured interviews with 132 12-13-year-old young people from four ethnic groups attending secondary schools in two inner London boroughs and a follow-up interview completed approximately 17 months later. Results. The data was analysed using chi-square and McNemar tests. Familial, religious and peer influence closely correlated with ethnicity. Bangladeshi young people showed lower levels of peer and higher levels of religious and familial involvement and lower levels of substance use. White young people reported higher levels of peer, lower levels of religious and familial involvement, and a higher level of substance use. Black African and Black Caribbean young people lay between the two extremes. Conclusion. The findings suggest that young people with lower levels of familial and religious influence, or higher levels of peer influence, have higher levels of substance consumption than other young people. Health education initiatives need to promote personal decision-making skills within the context of the young people's individual culture. Cultural diversity should be recognised within local health education needs assessment.","Adolescents; Ethnicity; Substance misuse","alcohol; drug; illicit drug; ethnicity; inner city area; socioeconomic conditions; adolescent; Africa south of the Sahara; article; Bangladesh; Caucasian; Central America; cultural anthropology; decision making; ethnic difference; family; female; group psychology; health education; high school; human; human experiment; interview; male; Negro; normal human; religion; school child; social aspect; social environment; statistical analysis; substance abuse; tobacco; United Kingdom; urban population; London; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032466686

Discovering these unassuming places (e.g. restaurants) of a city will benefit the understanding of local culture and help to build livable neighborhoods. Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing. These places are potential recreational areas for all groups of people and could be improved regarding urban design and planning to make these public infrastructures more attractive. This work demonstrates how multi-source big geo-data can be combined to build comprehensive place-based representations for different groups of people. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Place semantics; Residents and visitors; Social media check-ins; Social sensing; Street view images","Semantics; Urban planning; Data-driven approach; Physical environments; Place semantics; Public infrastructures; Residents and visitors; Social engagement; Social media; Social sensing; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080116331

Design Cross-sectional study July 2014-November 2016. Psychologists conducted Structured Clinical Interviews for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) (n=544). Psychiatrists interviewed a subsample (n=78). Setting Four Aboriginal Medical Services and the general community located in urban, regional and remote areas of Southern Queensland and two Aboriginal Reserves located in New South Wales. Participants Indigenous Australian adults. Outcome measures Cultural acceptability of SCID-I interviews, standardised rates of CMD, comorbid CMD and concordance with psychiatrist diagnoses. Results Participants reported that the SCID-I interviews were generally culturally acceptable. Standardised rates (95% CI) of current mood, anxiety, substance use and any mental disorder were 16.2% (12.2% to 20.2%), 29.2% (24.2% to 34.1%), 12.4% (8.8% to 16.1%) and 42.2% (38.8% to 47.7%), respectively-6.7-fold, 3.8-fold, 6.9-fold and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, than those of the Australian population. Differences between this Indigenous cohort and the Australian population were less marked for 12-month (2.4-fold) and lifetime prevalence (1.3-fold). Comorbid mental disorder was threefold to fourfold higher. In subgroups living on traditional lands in Indigenous reserves and in remote areas, the rate was half that of those living in mainstream communities. Moderate-to-good concordance with psychiatrist diagnoses was found. Conclusions The prevalence of current CMD in this Indigenous population is substantially higher than previous estimates. The lower relative rates of non-current disorders are consistent with underdiagnosis of previous events. The lower rates among Reserve and remote area residents point to the importance of Indigenous peoples' connection to their traditional lands and culture, and a potentially important protective factor. A larger study with random sampling is required to determine the population prevalence of CMD in Indigenous Australians. © 2018 Article author(s).","aboriginal reserves; common mental disorders; cultural acceptability; indigenous Australians; metropolitan & remote; regional; SCID-I","adult; age distribution; aged; alcoholism; anxiety disorder; Article; bipolar disorder; body dysmorphic disorder; cohort analysis; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; delusion; drug dependence; eating disorder; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; Indigenous Australian; major clinical study; major depression; male; mental disease; mood disorder; obsessive compulsive disorder; panic; phobia; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; psychiatrist; psychosis; sex difference; social phobia; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders; adolescent; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; ethnology; mental disease; middle aged; New South Wales; Oceanic ancestry group; Queensland; rural population; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; New South Wales; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Prevalence; Queensland; Rural Population; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049755055

Barriers to increasing physical activity included cost, personal safety and lack of time outside of long working hours and carer commitments. However, increasing walking activity was regarded as feasible by both community and health professional participants. Respondents emphasised using a social approach for potential interventions, undertaking activity with family or friends and with bilingual community peers to facilitate engagement, motivation and support. Spoken content and delivery of interventions was favoured, including personal stories and multilingual audio-visual information; within local informal rather than provider settings, including the home; and aided by pedometers for self-monitoring.CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on physical activity by increasing walking may hold promise as health promotion in this deprived South Asian community context. Further intervention development, with exploration of feasibility and acceptability of the social approach and elements suggested, is merited.OBJECTIVES: To explore perspectives on enhancing physical activity and diet among South Asians in urban deprived communities at high risk of chronic disease and to inform development of culturally appropriate health promotion intervention.DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured one-to-one and family group interviews with thematic analysis of data.SETTING: Urban disadvantaged communities in the East Midlands of the UK.PARTICIPANTS: 45 respondents, including 34 people of South Asian origin (16 at-risk individuals, six family groups involving 18 relatives), of mainly Pakistani and Indian origin, including 16 non-English speakers; and 11 health professionals working locally with communities of concern.

These people are too many to mention by name, but I owe all of them a debt of gratitude. While writing this book I was very fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of colleagues, particularly Lucy Horan and Ruth Craggs, as well as the support and encouragement of my other colleagues at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Finally, a huge thank you to John, Muireann and Aoife for absolutely everything.IntroductionIn 1991, Getz wrote that festivals and holiday events represented nouveau, alternative tourism (cited in Lee et al., 2008). How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of ‘ risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of ‘ emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature. Others, such as the sustainability of the sector's activities have been an issue for longer. Most recently of all, the question as to how festival and event activities are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated, in response to the harsh realities negatively affecting the health of the sector in very recent times. The 35 concepts that are discussed in this volume are laid out in alphabetical order. © Bernadette Quinn 2013.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949949301

These 'stonewall' trees denoting synergy between nature (trees) and culture (masonry) are worth preserving. This study aims to identify factors influencing public attitude toward this important but threatened natural-cum-cultural asset in a compact city milieu. Evidence is solicited from a face-to-face questionnaire survey involving 800 citizens of Hong Kong. Results indicate that Hong Kong people generally appreciate the existence of stonewall trees. Younger adults harbored doubts about their value, whereas the older ones were more sympathetic. Local residents of the suburbs that host the majority of stonewall trees registered stronger commitment than non-local residents. Community attachment had positive effects across both resident groups, but length of tenure was not a key factor. This suggests that affinity for stonewall trees is a function of the affective bonding between people and the community where they live. Deep engagement with the local community elevated the desire for preserving the walls and associated trees. The findings are important for understanding public perception and enlisting support from the larger society for preserving the urban asset against mounting pressures for urban development and renewal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Compact city; Place attachment; Public perception; Stone-retaining walls; Urban nature conservation; Urban trees","environmental protection; masonry; nature conservation; perception; urban design; urban development; urban planning; urban renewal; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908632295

Determining the factors that influence a person's decision to disclose a positive status is essential to understanding the process of and ways to improve disclosure rates. This study investigated the factors that influence the disclosure of a person's HIV-positive status and focused on socio-demographic factors, stigma and discrimination, religion, culture, fear of abandonment and rejection as well as knowledge of the disease that may all influence disclosure rates. A facility based descriptive cross-sectional research design with a quantitative approach was applied using convenience sampling. The sample comprised 150 individuals which was 12.5% of the study population. A self-administered questionnaire comprising mainly closed-ended questions, with a limited number of open ended questions was designed, tested and utilised. Statistical associations were determined between the demographic factors and responses to the questions. The open ended questions were analysed thematically by means of content analysis to extract meaning. The results revealed that fear of stigmatisation, especially among the male participants, was a major reason for delayed or non-disclosure. The results of the total study sample also showed that the level of education influenced the fear of stigmatisation; those with secondary school level education were most afraid of this (29%). There was a statistically significant association between fear of blame or discrimination and disclosure to the sexual partner. This fear was most often cited by the participants who had never married (19%). The participants who feared blame or discrimination the most reported having no income (23%). The findings of this study indicate that numerous factors influence HIV disclosure. Stigma of individuals who are HIV-positive remains a barrier to disclosure as well as fear of blame and discrimination. Recommendations were made to facilitate and increase disclosure rates. This should include community based support groups and advocating partners to attend voluntary counselling and testing together to minimise the fear of blame. © 2014 NISC (Pty) Ltd.","Counselling; Discrimination; People living with HIV/AIDS; Prevention","adult; article; content analysis; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; educational status; fear; female; high school; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; interpersonal communication; major clinical study; male; patient counseling; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; religion; social aspect; social discrimination; social rejection; South Africa; stigma; support group; adolescent; counseling; fear; HIV Infections; middle aged; perceptive discrimination; prejudice; psychology; qualitative research; social stigma; socioeconomics; stereotyping; urban population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Counseling; Cross-Sectional Studies; Discrimination (Psychology); Fear; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prejudice; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Social Stigma; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; Stereotyping; Truth Disclosure; Urban Population; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900298549

The research found that the level of compliance with residential standards is quite low and can vary from one standard to another and from one house to another due to differences in the socio-economic characteristics among people. The findings of multiple regression analysis reveal that there is a good level of public awareness of residential standards, but this does not result in complete compliance with residential standards. Factors, such as household income per month, household size, finance facilities, municipal administration culture, monitoring, enforcement and the uncertainty of residential standards have a significant impact on the extent of compliance with planning standards. Suggestions for improved urban planning practices which address these issues are summarised in the paper and include reassessed current residential standards through comprehensive legal frameworks, linking residential standards with urban design approaches, changing planning practices, developing information systems to produce effective monitoring systems of construction processes and enforcement mechanisms, the development of local staff including planners, designers and environmental engineers, supported partnerships between private and public sectors, and the use of participatory planning and citizen involvement.

These dimensions interact with one another in all directions and on many time-scales. From 2010 to 2050, the human population is likely to grow bigger, more slowly, older, and more urban. It is projected that by 2050 more than 2.6 billion people (almost 94% of global urban growth) will be added to the urban population in today's developing countries. That works out to 1.26 million additional urban people in today's developing countries every week from 2010 to 2050. Humans alter the climate by emitting greenhouse gases, by altering planetary albedo, and by altering atmospheric components. Between 1900 and 2000, humans' emissions of carbon into the atmosphere increased fifteenfold, while the numbers of people increased less than fourfold. Population growth alone, with constant rates of emissions per person, could not account for the increase in the carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The world economy grew sixteenfold in the twentieth century, accompanied by enormous increases in the burning of gas, oil, and coal. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, population grew much faster in developing countries than in high-income countries, and, compared with population growth, the growth of carbon emissions to the atmosphere was even faster in developing countries than in high-income countries. The ratio of emissions-to-population growth rates was 2.8 in developing countries compared with 1.6 in high-income countries. Emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are influenced by the sizes and density of settlements, the sizes of households, and the ages of householders. Between 2010 and 2050, these demographic factors are anticipated to change substantially. Therefore demography will play a substantial role in the dynamics of climate changes. Climate changes affect many aspects of the living environment, including human settlements, food production, and diseases. These changes will affect poor people more severely than rich, and poor nations more severely than rich. Yet not enough is known to predict quantitatively many details that will matter enormously to future people and other species. Three kinds of responses are related to demographic issues that affect climate changes: universal secondary education, voluntary contraception and maternal health services, and smarter urban design and construction. These responses may prevent, reduce, or ameliorate the impacts of climate changes. They are as relevant to rich countries as to poor, though in ways that are as different as are rich countries and poor. They are desirable in their own right because they improve the lives of the people they affect directly; and they are desirable for their beneficial effects on the larger society and globe. They are effective responses to the twin challenges of reducing poverty and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",,"adaptation; climate change; educational status; environmental protection; fertility; greenhouse effect; health; human; population; population dynamics; population growth; poverty; review; risk factor; Adaptation, Physiological; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Educational Status; Fertility; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Population; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Poverty; Risk Factors; World Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959610113

Design/methodology/approach – This case study builds on the 24/hour city concept and provides a practical example of how culture/led urban revitalisation through the Light Night programme can be implemented in Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Nottingham and Sheffield based on successful international experiences. Findings – Evidence gathered through a review of the literature provided in this case study would suggest that community involvement through creative culture/led urban revitalisation initiatives can be instrumental in developing sustainable places and communities. Furthermore, it may provide a pathway towards overcoming some of the negative perceptions associated with the night/time economy in many British town and city centres. The Light Night programme provides an opportunity for key social stakeholders to implement this through its focus on shared culture, history and identity. Originality/value – This paper reviews the evolution of the European Nuit Blanche initiative using a case study approach, and its interpretation in the UK through the Light Night programme. It further explores the economic, cultural and social benefits of Light Nights and Nuit Blanche on community cohesion, tourism and regeneration. This paper is of value to practitioners and policy/makers in place marketing, town centre management, local authority economic development officers, business managers, urban regeneration consultants, academics, tourism officers, community leaders and town centre residents. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cities; Culture; United Kingdom; Urban regions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993030507

As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like ""community supported fisheries"" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more ""green."" Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of ""ocean literacy"" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals. © 2014 Timothy Beatley.

The aim of this exploratory study was to directly estimate the perceived health and wellbeing benefits attained from parks and the economic value assigned to parks by park users in Victoria, Australia. The research employed a mixed methods approach (survey and interviews) to collect primary data from a selection of 140 park users: 100 from two metropolitan parks in Melbourne and 40 from a park on the urban fringe of Melbourne, Victoria. Our findings suggest that park users derive a range of perceived physical, mental/spiritual, and social health benefits, but park use was predominantly associated with physical health benefits. Overall, our exploratory study findings suggest that park users are willing to pay for parks, as they highly value them as places for exercising, socialising, and relaxing. Importantly, most people would miss parks if they did not exist. The findings aim to provide park managers, public health advocates, and urban policy makers with evidence about the perceived health and wellbeing benefits of park usage and the economic value park visitors place on parks. © 2017 by the authors.

A research project on the small Italian Renaissance city of Urbino explores how a number of marketing events dedicated to the painter Raphael, who was born there, have been produced and then received among different urban “populations” (dwellers, commuters, students, etc.). The second part of the paper conceptualizes events as both “inward” and “outward” forces and compares the Raphaellian events with some of Urbino's traditional festivities. Design/methodology/approach – This is a qualitative study that applies discourse analysis to media texts, official documents and 42 in-depth interviews held with both local officials and internal place consumers. Findings – The inquiry reveals a predominance of discourses in support of the events: civic pride, identification, and economic benefits. What is more striking is that some participants not only appreciated the marketing events but “went beyond” by producing discourses in support of a more intensive exploitation of Urbino's cultural and heritage resources. Research limitations/implications – Quantitative research is recommended to generalize evidence stemming from ethnographic inquiry and to measure “the magnitude” of the different discourses produced by the people. Originality/value – This paper contributes to overcoming the materialist perspective which underpins a consistent part of literature by showing a new (counter)example of the “non-oppositional voices” of place marketing. Moreover, it sheds more light on how “tertiary communication” takes place and how it can be properly investigated. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cities; Festivals; Heritage; Italy; Place branding; Place marketing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993073675

The paper argues that many design policies inspired by the sustainability agenda do not take into account inclusive urban design considerations, and thus large sectors of the population are adversely affected. While attention is given to the needs of the disabled, particular emphasis is put in this paper upon the design needs of women and older people who together compose around a third of the population. The impact of compact layouts and higher densities in residential areas is first discussed, along with the problems created by increased car control, without commensurate transport policy alternatives, or adequate, safe pedestrian routeways. Second the problems of city centres are discussed where sustainability policy is also being targeted, but other priorities including the new urbanism, the 24-hour city, the evening economy and the city of culture jostle for pre-eminence. It is concluded that the lack of awareness of people's needs and inclusive design principles are reducing the chances of ordinary people accessing, comfortably moving around and enjoying the city. In order to bridge the gap between sustainability and inclusive design in planning, it is concluded that greater emphasis must be given to user needs and the constraints of everyday life.","Pavement design; Social impact; Sustainability","Regional planning; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Inclusive design; Pavement design; Residential areas; Social impact; Sustainability policy; Sustainable settlements; Transport policy; Urban designers; Bridges; pavement; social impact; social inclusion; sustainable development; urban area; urban design; urban planning; urban policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957953947

Using qualitative analytic methods, these interviews were coded for themes and examined in relation to historical perceptions of disabled persons in Ghana. The results suggest that there appears to be a growing acceptance that people with disabilities have rights as human beings and that the Disability Rights Bill is a positive step in the right direction for Ghana. There was no consensus, however, on what these basic rights entail, and who is responsible for enforcing and funding new policies.

Chandigarh emerged as part of the post-Partition need for a new capital for the Punjab, and involved the efforts of several people and levels of government. The context of newly achieved nationhood became important in the way it shaped the ideals of both national and local political leaders, who wanted architects to transfer these into built form. How successful the architects were in this enterprise was shaped by their professional ideologies and understanding (or lack of it) of the local. Much scholarship exists on issues such as early decisions about Chandigarh's establishment, the Mayer and Le Corbusier plans for the city, and the buildings comprising the Capitol complex that were designed by Le Corbusier. Much less attention has been given to the residential areas of Chandigarh and all that lay beyond the Capitol complex and constitutes the actual town. How did the ideas of modernism, the requirements of the nationalist state, and concern for the local shape the built environment?

Design. This report draws primarily on the qualitative arm of a mixed methods study which collected data from 126 young people, aged 15-18, largely through focus groups in the London boroughs of Hackney, Newham and Tower Hamlets. Results. Previous research has reported culture influencing the patterning of risk/protection amongst BME groups. Our data suggest that this is mediated by gender, religion and youth. Religion reportedly influenced young women's sexual behaviour in multiple ways. Young people described gendered norms in meeting and flirting with partners, and the role of mobile phones and peer pressure. Conclusion. Our paper suggests culture, gender, religion and youth influence BME teenagers in aspects of sexual relationships, and that these social markers may have different contextual meanings for individuals.

Understanding decisions about whether or not to disclose violence in response to routine enquiry in health settings can inform safe and responsive systems. Elevated rates of violence and systematic disadvantage found among Indigenous women globally, can impact on their decisions to disclose violence. This study aimed to test, among Indigenous women, a model for decisions on whether to disclose intimate partner violence in the context of antenatal routine screening. Design we employed Qualitative Configurative Analysis, a method developed for the social sciences to study complex phenomena with intermediate sample sizes. Data were drawn from single semi- structured interviews with Indigenous women 28+ weeks pregnant attending antenatal care. Interviews addressed decisions to disclose recent intimate partner violence in the context of routine enquiry during the antenatal care. Interview transcripts were binary coded for conditions identified a priori from the model being tested and also from themes identified within the current study and analysed using Qualitative Configurative Analysis to determine causal conditions for the outcome of disclosure or non-disclosure of violence experienced. Settings five Aboriginal and Maternal Infant Health Services (two urban and three regional), and one mainstream hospital, in New South Wales, Australia. Participants indigenous women who had experienced partner violence in the previous year and who had been asked about this as part of an antenatal booking-in visit. Of the 12 participants six had elected to disclose their experience of violence to the midwife, and six had chosen not to do so. Findings pathways to disclosure and non-disclosure were mapped using Qualitative Configurative Analysis. Conditions relevant to decisions to disclose were similar to the conditions for non-Aboriginal women found in our earlier study. Unique to Aboriginal women's decisions to disclose abuse was cultural safety. Cultural safety included elements we titled: Borrowed trust, Build the relationship first, Come at it slowly and People like me are here. The absence of cultural safety Its absence was also a factor in decisions not to disclose experiences of violence by this group of women. Key conclusions cultural safety was central to Indigenous women's decision to disclose violence and processes for creating safety are identified. Other forms of safety which influenced disclosure included: safety from detection by the abuser; safety from shame; and safety from institutional control. Disclosure was promoted by direct asking by the midwife and a perception of care. Non-disclosure was associated with a lack of care and a lack of all four types of safety. Experiences of institutional racism were associated with Indigenous women's perceived risk of control by others, particularly child protection services. Implications for practice policies to ask abuse questions at first visits and models where continuity of care is not maintained, are problematic for Aboriginal women, among whom relationship building is important as is ample warning about questions to be asked. Strategies are needed to build cultural safety to counter widespread racism and promote safe opportunities for Indigenous women to disclose intimate partner violence and receive support.

During the process of urbanization, a diversity of factors should be balancedly considered for the design of landscape configuration. Amongst these factors, people’s landscape preferences are given growing emphasis. Landscape preferences have been widely examined and some studies have been designed to link landscape preferences to landscape patterns. However, most studies have been conducted from a 2D perspective and therefore cannot simulate people’s actual perception of local landscape configurations. This paper proposes a framework, based on which 3D landscape pattern analysis and landscape preferences can be efficiently integrated for evaluating urban landscape configurations. Airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) is an ideal tool for conducting 3D landscape pattern analysis. In accordance with 3D landscape pattern analysis, standardized and generally applicable surveys of landscape preferences can be designed and conducted in different areas. A case study was conducted in Cambridge and Canvey, UK to demonstrate how 3D urban landscape patterns can be analyzed. Furthermore, a case study was conducted in Cambridge, UK and Nanjing, China to explain how people’s landscape preferences can be acquired and compared. Landscape pattern analysis indicated that 3D landscape models effectively revealed comprehensive landscape patterns and simulated people’s perception of local landscape configurations. For instance, cross-culture surveys on general landscape preferences proved the existence of commonly shared landscape preferences, which may be used as evaluation criteria. This methodology provides reference for landscape planners and decision makers to enhance urban landscape configurations. The methodology is of potential contribution to China’s rapid urbanization by suggesting practical approaches to improve landscape patterns according to people’s preferences. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","3D pattern analysis; Evaluation; Landscape preferences; Lidar; Urbanization","Decision making; Surveys; 3d patterns; Evaluation; Landscape configuration; Landscape pattern analysis; Landscape preferences; Light detection and ranging; Urban landscape patterns; Urbanization; Optical radar; airborne survey; decision making; land evaluation; landscape structure; lidar; pattern recognition; perception; socioeconomic impact; three-dimensional modeling; urban area; urbanization; Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; Cambridgeshire; Canvey Island; China; England; Essex [England]; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975842621

Quantitative exposure modeling provides opportunities to investigate the relative importance of fecal-oral transmission routes (e.g. hands, water, food) responsible for diarrheal disease. Modeling, however, requires accurate descriptions of individuals' interactions with the environment (i.e., activity data). Such activity data are largely lacking for people in low-income settings. In the present study, we collected activity data and microbiological sampling data to develop a quantitative microbial exposure model for two female caretakers in peri-urban Tanzania. Activity data were combined with microbiological data of contacted surfaces and fomites (e.g. broom handle, soil, clothing) to develop example exposure profiles describing second-by-second estimates of fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci) concentrations on the caretaker's hands. The study demonstrates the application and utility of video activity data to quantify exposure factors for people in low-income countries and apply these factors to understand fecal contamination exposure pathways. This study provides both a methodological approach for the design and implementation of larger studies, and preliminary data suggesting contacts with dirt and sand may be important mechanisms of hand contamination. Increasing the scale of activity data collection and modeling to investigate individual-level exposure profiles within target populations for specific exposure scenarios would provide opportunities to identify the relative importance of fecal-oral disease transmission routes. © 2015 Julian, Pickering.",,"Article; bacterial transmission; bacterium colony; bacterium contamination; bacterium culture; controlled study; Enterococcus; environmental exposure; Escherichia coli; female; human; infection risk; limit of detection; nonhuman; pilot study; population exposure; Tanzania; urban area; videorecording; adult; caregiver; diarrhea; environmental monitoring; Escherichia coli infection; ethics; feces; Gram positive infection; growth, development and aging; hand disinfection; microbiology; poverty; preschool child; statistical model; transmission; urban population; videorecording; Adult; Caregivers; Child, Preschool; Diarrhea; Enterococcus; Environmental Monitoring; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Feces; Female; Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections; Hand Disinfection; Humans; Models, Statistical; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Tanzania; Urban Population; Video Recording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942931613

Interdisciplinary research requires the creation of new tools that allow the investigation of relations between people and biodiversity. It has been established that access to green spaces or nature benefits city dwellers, but the role of species diversity in providing psychological benefits remains poorly studied. We developed a user-friendly 3-dimensional computer program (Virtual Garden [www.tinyurl.com/3DVirtualGarden]) that allows people to design their own public or private green spaces with 95 biotic and abiotic features. Virtual Garden allows researchers to explore what elements of biodiversity people would like to have in their nearby green spaces while accounting for other functions that people value in urban green spaces. In 2011, 732 participants used our Virtual Garden program to design their ideal small public garden. On average gardens contained 5 different animals, 8 flowers, and 5 woody plant species. Although the mathematical distribution of flower and woody plant richness (i.e., number of species per garden) appeared to be similar to what would be expected by random selection of features, 30% of participants did not place any animal species in their gardens. Among those who placed animals in their gardens, 94% selected colorful species (e.g., ladybug [Coccinella septempunctata], Great Tit [Parus major], and goldfish), 53% selected herptiles or large mammals, and 67% selected non-native species. Older participants with a higher level of education and participants with a greater concern for nature designed gardens with relatively higher species richness and more native species. If cities are to be planned for the mutual benefit of people and biodiversity and to provide people meaningful experiences with urban nature, it is important to investigate people's relations with biodiversity further. Virtual Garden offers a standardized tool with which to explore these relations in different environments, cultures, and countries. It can also be used by stakeholders (e.g., city planners) to consider people's opinions of local design. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","City dwellers; Connection to nature; Conservation psychology; Ecosystem services; Perceptions; Species diversity; Urban ecology","biodiversity; ecosystem service; flower; garden; greenspace; interdisciplinary approach; metazoan; perception; psychology; software; stakeholder; urban ecosystem; article; attitude; biodiversity; city; city dwellers; computer interface; computer program; conexión con la naturaleza; connection to nature; conservation psychology; diversidad de especies; ecología urbana; Ecosystem services; educational status; environmental protection; gardening; habitantes de ciudades; human; methodology; percepciones; perceptions; psicología de la conservación; servicios ecosistémicos; species difference; species diversity; urban ecology; city dwellers; conexión con la naturaleza; connection to nature; conservation psychology; diversidad de especies; ecología urbana; ecosystem services; habitantes de ciudades; percepciones; perceptions; psicología de la conservación; servicios ecosistémicos; species diversity; urban ecology; Attitude; Biodiversity; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Educational Status; Gardening; Humans; Software; Species Specificity; User-Computer Interface; Animalia; Carassius auratus; Coccinella septempunctata; Mammalia; Parus major",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880700835

Nonetheless, they also gave rise to problems of social exclusion and conflict, becoming undesirable facilities that weakened social health. This study examined ways of producing an improved building plan that can raise the level of social health of public apartments, which were consistently built in the past but will no doubt continue to be developed in the future. For this study, the survey method was employed through a questionnaire with visual contents especially developed to raise the level of social health based on two ideas. One was to increase the possibility of social interaction among residents, and the other was to increase opportunities for residents to interact with society as well as for their social integration. The results showed that residents had mostly favorable views on the proposed plans: in particular, they favored highly the formation of a lobby in each apartment building as a venue for social interaction. They also responded very favorably to the plan of creating within the buildings spare space that will be used not only to promote a communal culture, but to open to outside society as well for integration. This study showed vital ideas to ensure the recovery of the residential function of promoting social health in the public apartments of Korea. It has significance in inspiring an innovative approach to allow social mixture in a relatively different feasible manner from the conventional approach. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

There has been no shortage of proposed solutions: Find great principals and give them power; create competitive markets with charters, vouchers, and choice; establish small schools to ensure that students receive sufficient attention-the list goes on. Although these approaches have created positive changes in individual schools, they have failed to produce a single high-performing urban school system. In this article, the authors, who are members of Harvard University's Public Education Leadership Project (PELP), explain why. One reason, they say, is that educators, researchers, and policy makers see the district office, which oversees all the schools in a district, as part of the problem rather than a crucial part of the solution-and this is a mistake. The district office plays an important role in developing strategies, identifying and spreading best practices, developing leadership capabilities at all levels, building information systems to monitor student improvement, and holding people accountable for results. The authors propose a holistic framework that district leaders can use to develop an improvement strategy and build coherent organizations to implement it. The framework is based on three beliefs. First, school systems need their own management models; they cannot simply import them from the business world. Second, ""the customer"" is the student; therefore, urban districts need to focus on improving teaching and learning in every classroom at every school. Third, district leaders must design their organizations so that all the components-culture, systems and structures, resources, and mechanisms for managing stakeholders and the external environment-reinforce one another and support the implementation of the strategy across schools.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750923890

In this wave of revival, many groups are marginalized, the reclaimed public space is often sanitized, gentrified and fortified, and not inclusive. However, there are urban public spaces that defy or at least resist these trends. Examining urban neighbourhood main streets reveals that even though the contemporary urban street can never be an unregulated place of unconstrained diversity, there are streets that counter the prevalent culture of consumption, and one can find visible signs of spontaneity and diversity of people and activities, and genuine social life. Using research in urban sociology, a taxonomy for sociability is developed, and the existing range of classifications of outdoor social activities is expanded. Through empirical examination, this paper explains how these streets perform as social spaces—how sociability is enacted, and what is the nature of planning, design and management, which supports social behaviours. Finally, the research emphasizes the role of the street as an ordinary public space in creating affordances for everyday social contacts that are crucial to personal well-being and social cohesion. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","Main streets; Public space; Sociability; Social life; Taxonomy; Urban design","public space; trend analysis; urban design; urban planning; urban renewal; urban society",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052589175

The aim of this study was to describe how care home staff understand and respond to agitation and the factors that determine how it is managed. Design We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis. Setting We recruited staff from six care homes in South East England including residential and nursing homes of differing sizes run by both the private and charity sector and located in urban and rural areas. Participants We interviewed 25 care home staff using purposive sampling to include staff of either sex, differing age, ethnicity, nationality and with different roles and experience. Results We identified four overarching themes: (1) behaviours expressing unmet need; (2) staff emotional responses to agitation; (3) understanding the individual helps and (4) constraints on staff responses. Staff struggled with the paradox of trying to connect with the personhood of residents while seeing the person as separate to and, therefore, not responsible for their behaviours. Staff often felt powerless, frightened and overwhelmed, and their responses were constrained by care home structures, processes and a culture of fear and scrutiny. Conclusions Responding to agitation expressed by residents was not a linear process and staff faced tensions and dilemmas in deciding how to respond, especially when initial strategies were unsuccessful or when attempts to respond to residents' needs were inhibited by structural and procedural constraints in the care home. Future trials of psychosocial interventions should support staff to identify and respond to residents' unmet needs and include how staff can look after themselves. © 2018 Author(s).","agitation; care homes; care staff; Dementia; psychosocial interventions","agitation; Article; clinical article; dementia; emotion; employment; England; ethnicity; fear; female; health personnel attitude; human; hunger; knowledge; male; medical education; nursing home; nursing staff; qualitative research; rural area; thematic analysis; urban area; adult; aged; aggression; caregiver; complication; dementia; disease management; education; geriatric assessment; health personnel attitude; home for the aged; information processing; middle aged; nursing home; procedures; psychology; restlessness; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aggression; Attitude of Health Personnel; Caregivers; Dementia; Disease Management; England; Female; Focus Groups; Geriatric Assessment; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Homes; Psychomotor Agitation; Qualitative Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049759738

Design and Method: Cross-sectional design at 40 Indigenous events. Self-complete surveys were administered to Indigenous people aged 16–29 years using mobile devices. Results: 2,877 participants completed the survey. One in five reported using cannabis at least weekly in the previous year, but the use of other drugs was less prevalent. Patterns of drug use were largely similar across regions, although more participants in urban and regional areas reported using ecstasy (12% vs 11% vs 5%) and cocaine (6% vs 3% vs 1%) and more reported weekly cannabis use (18% vs 22% vs 14%). Injecting was rare (3%) but those who did inject reported a high incidence of needle sharing (37%). Methamphetamine (37%), heroin (36%) and methadone (26%) were the most commonly injected drugs, and injecting was related to prison experience (AOR 5.3 95% CI 2.8–10.0). Discussion and Conclusion: Attention is needed in relation to cannabis use, particularly among those Indigenous young people living in regional and urban settings. Also, although injecting is uncommon, it is associated with prison involvement. Priority must be given to reducing the numbers of Indigenous youth entering justice settings, delaying the age at first entry to justice settings, and reducing the risk of BBV acquisition while in custody through, for example, prison-based NSP, BBV education, and Indigenous-specific treatment that emphasises connection to country and culture.

HTE is a meetup group initiated at the State Library of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, and dedicated to provide visitors with opportunities for connected learning in relation to hacking, making and do-it-yourself technology. The results provide insights into factors that contributed to HTE as a social, interactive and participatory environment for learning – knowledge is created and co-created through uncoordinated interactions among participants that come from a diversity of backgrounds, skills and areas of expertise. The insights also reveal challenges and barriers that the HTE group faced in regards to connected learning.

The authors evaluated whether patterns of prescription drug misuse differed across several youth cultures. Design and Methods: Using field survey methods and time-space sampling during 2011, the authors assessed the patterns and prevalence of prescription drug misuse among young adults who are socially active in various urban youth cultures (n=1781). Results: The prevalence of lifetime prescription drug misuse is highest within indie rock scenes (52.5%), electronic dance music scenes (52.1%), lesbian parties (53.8%) and alt scenes (50.9%). Prescription drug misuse was lowest among young adults in hip-hop scenes (25.0%). These findings were upheld in logistic regression analyses that accounted for demographic differences across youth cultures: indie rock scenes (adjusted odds ratio=2.11), electronic dance music scenes (adjusted odds ratio=2.20), lesbian parties (adjusted odds ratio=2.30) and alt scenes (adjusted odds ratio=2.65) all reported statistically significant (P<0.05) higher odds of misuse than college bar scenes. Recent prescription drug misuse mirrored patterns for lifetime misuse. Discussion and Conclusions: The differing prevalence of prescription drug misuse across distinct youth cultures suggests that the trend has not diffused equally among young people. The differing prevalence across youth cultures indicates that the most efficacious strategies for youth intervention may be targeted approaches that account for the subculturally rooted differences in attitudes and social norms. © 2012 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.","Prescription drug misuse; Subculture; Young adult; Youth culture","addiction; age; article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cultural anthropology; drug misuse; ethnology; female; human; male; male homosexuality; methodology; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; social behavior; student; young adult; Age Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Culture; Female; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Prescription Drug Misuse; Social Behavior; Students; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876425218

It also proposes that the earliest urban centers were attractive places of settlement because they represented a greater variety of jobs and objects compared to the rural countryside. Design/methodology/approach: The evolutionary trajectory of our species indicates that humans sought out abundance in their natural environments as early as a million years ago. People also deliberately replicated conditions of abundance through the manufacture and discard of large quantities of repetitive objects, and through the ""waste"" of usable goods. The development of urban centers 6,000 years ago provided new opportunities for both production and consumption and an abundance of diverse goods and services. These processes are analogous to contemporary economists' views of abundance as a desirable principle and Chris Anderson's view of the Long Tail as the explanatory mechanism for the production and consumption of goods when greater distribution becomes possible. Social implications: Today, cities are growing very rapidly despite objectively deleterious conditions such as crowding, pollution, competition, and disease transmission. By recognizing the ""pull"" factors of consumption and opportunity, researchers can expend their energies to mitigate the negative effects of cities' inevitable growth. Originality/value: Prior archaeological and contemporary analyses of cities have focused on the role of the upper echelons of the political and economic hierarchy; in contrast, this ""bottom-up"" approach addresses the attractions of cities from the perspective of ordinary inhabitants.

The book reveals hardships the city encountered in the 1950s and the glamour enjoyed in the 1980s. It depicts the public and private developments, and especially the public housing which has sheltered millions of residents. The author identifies the architects practising in the formative years and the representatives of a rising generation after the 1980s. Suffering from land shortage and a dense environment, the urban development of Hong Kong has in the past 70 years met the changing demands of fluctuating economic activities and a rising population. Architecture on the island has been shaped by social demands, the economy and technology. The buildings have been forged by the government, clients, planners, architects, many contractors and end-users. The built environment nurtures our life and is visual evidence of the way the city has developed. Hong Kong is a key to East Asia in the Pacific Era. The book is a must-read for a thorough understanding the contemporary history and architecture of this oriental pearl. Endorsement: ""Hong Kong sets an extreme example of hyper-density living.

Small-scale, community originated festivals proliferate the rural landscape throughout the UK and yet despite this, festival research has focussed predominantly on large, urban events and on their economic impact (Wood, 2009; Gibson and Connell, 2011). This paper seeks to address the perceived research gap by examining these events through a lens of social sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a case study approach focussed on four festivals in Northumberland, UK. Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with festival organisers, key figures and visitors. Following a constructivist grounded theory method four principle indicators were identified to determine festival contribution to community social sustainability. These indicators are: contribution to community pride and localness, enhancement of knowledge and understanding, contribution to the continuity of local culture and enablement of networks of connectivity. Findings: The findings demonstrate the networks of connections which festivals enable between the culture, heritage and people (individuals and groups) of a place. By focussing on four indicators the paper shows the social impact of connections through the festival processes and content. The paper argues that small-scale festivals in rural locations can contribute to social sustainability if they demonstrate a balance of both consistency and innovation and accessibility and openness within the locale.

The negative consequences that commercial signs can have on the visual quality of urban areas and further more, on people's quality of life, has been studied from both architectural, planning and psychological perspectives. While the issue of visual pollution, as this phenomenon is commonly described, has been widely debated, there is as yet no clear conclusion as to how best to control commercial signage and whether different urban contexts and people from different backgrounds and cultures have universal or distinct preferences. Several different commenrcial signage approaches are currently applied to different historic cities, but these initiatives are not based on principles derived from the perception and evaluation of users. Drawing on a range of comparative and contrasting empirical studies of historic city centres in the UK and Brazil, this book examines questions of commercial signage control management, the preservation of historic heritage and user preference and satisfaction. The author takes an environment behaviour approach to this research, involving theories, concepts and methodologies related to environmental psychology, architecture, planning and urban design. In doing so, it argues that there are in fact visual preferences common to the majority of people, independent of their urban context and that these common views can be useful to the development of a general theory of how to control commercial signage. In conclusion, the book suggests that the best way of controlling signage is not only to recommend general guidelines related to the operation of commercial signage, but also to recommend design principles that can create commercial streetscapes evaluated positively by different users. © Adriana Portella 2014.

The present study is focused on the Patna municipal area, inhabited by 17 million people and spanning over 134 km2, where entire urban water demand is catered from pumping by wells of various capacities and designs. The present study examines the nature of the aquifer system within the urban area, the temporal changes in the water/piezometric level and the recharge mechanism of the deeper aquifers. The aquifer system is made up of medium-to-coarse unconsolidated sand, lying under a ~40-m-thick predominantly argillaceous unit holding 8- to 13-m-thick localised sand layers and continues up to 220 m below ground. Groundwater occurs under semi-confined condition, with transmissivity of aquifers in 5,500-9,200 m2 day-1 range. Hydraulic head of the deeper aquifer remains in 9-19 m range below ground, in contrast to 1-9 m range of that of the upper aquitard zone. The estimated annual groundwater extraction from the deeper aquifer is ~212.0 million m3, which has created a decline of 3.9 m in the piezometric level of the deeper aquifer during the past 30 years. Unregulated construction of deep tube wells with mushrooming of apartment culture may further exacerbate the problem. The sand layers within the aquitard zone are experiencing an annual extraction of 14.5 million m3 and have exhibited stable water level trend for past one and half decades. This unit is recharged from monsoon rainfall, besides contribution from water supply pipe line leakage and seepage from unlined storm water drains. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Aquifers; Gangetic plains; Groundwater resource; Hydrogeology; Urban water supply; Water level decline",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895075536

Although the British had built New Delhi as the new capital of the Raj at the beginning of the twentieth century, there were hardly any trained Indians to undertake the task of planning and architecture. While British India had done a remarkable job in educating Indians in liberal arts and law, it had done very little to promote disciplines such as engineering, architecture and technical education. The development of Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar and Gandhinagar, between 1949 and 1982, represents a fascinating study of practical politics, personal ambitions of politicians and Western planners, and the high ideals of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The architect-planner Le Corbusier, together with Nehru, provided the new planning model and architectural design that would overshadow imperial New Delhi. Chandigarh was to serve as a training school for Indian planners, who could then duplicate their experience in other cities to improve urban India, and also influence rural India. The story of Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar and Gandhinagar is not one of success or failure or even of comparative satisfaction with the quality of life in a new city. It is, rather, a chronicle of a period during which India made a bold attempt to make a break with her past within the confines of a socio-urban experiment that included, along with an innovative master plan, modernist buildings, new land-use patterns, provisions for education, recreation, medical and social services, the careful and deliberate inclusion of ideas that had their origin in a culture far removed from her own.

It embodies the perennial tension between the city as home to a unique local culture and the city as a site of state power. The historians who oversaw the design of the exhibits envisioned a celebration of local everyday life, and focused their efforts on narrating the history of a mythic urban folk. A critical walk through the museum reveals three fundamental modes of mythic projection that underwrote this folk narrative: the city of the past as a ""world we have lost,"" commonplace tools as icons of an essential native culture resisting modernization, and the modern century as a march of progress in everyday life, indexed by ever-improving commodities. Throughout this narrative, the protagonists are the ""ordinary people"" (shomin) of Edo-Tokyo. In contrast, the building's architect saw the city solely in terms of its national significance and sought to project an image of grandeur suited to the position of Japan as triumphant superpower. No conflict was recognized between the two seemingly contradictory impulses, however, since myths of the everyday, exploited by government as well as academics in these years, promoted the easy fusion of local and national narratives.",,"museum; nationalism; Honshu; Japan; Tokyo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034853371

It has disseminated a culture of peace in a social context characterised by high levels of violence. Diverse systemic problem structuring methods were used throughout the development of the programme. The creative design of methods guided the research and contributed to develop an evolving, participative multimethodology that mixes methods and tools from the qualitative/quantitative spectrum, including interactive planning, critical systems heuristics, soft systems methodology, statistics, and methods from the conflict resolution field. The peace programme was initially designed using a synergy of problem structuring methods, and several tools and methods were used thereafter to improve the programme as its contexts evolved. Community operational research and systems thinking have had an impact on the programme since its initial stages, and have contributed to modify it based on well-grounded quantitative and qualitative information. This programme has reached more than a million people in Colombian society, and has been internationally recognised as one of the most innovative and impacting experiences for Latin American social development. It has created a culture of peace in hundreds of schools, having transformative effects on the individuals as well as on their social relations.

The monthly sessions provide a forum to share personal thoughts and feelings. The purpose of this paper is to learn why people attend SCR, understand what is gained from the experience, and identify key elements to use in measuring the program’s effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach – This qualitative descriptive study used four focus groups and three telephone interviews for data collection. Purposive sampling resulted in a multidisciplinary sample of 30 participants. Thematic analysis was conducted with complete transcripts by all researchers. Findings – All parties viewed SCR as beneficial. Six themes emerged during data analysis: culture change, exposing emotions, walking in another’s shoes, inequality of topics, influence of rules and boundaries, and personal impact. Institutional culture was positively influenced through SCR. Research limitations/implications – Limitations include a single institution and restricted data gathered from physicians. Future research should focus on identifying outcome measures to evaluate the long-term impact of SCR on healthcare organizations. Practical implications – This study confirms that the SCR program should be continued at the study organization, and expanded to increase availability to all staff. The growth of this program in healthcare organizations across the country is encouraged.

The Czechoslavic [sic] Ethnographic Exhibition, which took place in Prague in 1895, aimed to promote the idea of the ethnically unified, but at the same time regionally diverse, identity of the Czech-speaking people living in Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia. Having to negotiate their identity with the ethnic Germans of Bohemia, the Czechs consciously excluded them from the event both as organizers and as exhibitors. The exhibition could therefore be seen as a symptom of its time - in the late nineteenth century Central Europe, locating national heritage was crucial and folk culture played an important role in the national politics, and not only for the Czechs. This article focuses mainly on the ethnographic exhibit entitled 'the Exhibition Village', which consisted of an eclectic selection of village houses and their imitations from Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia. On this basis, it explores the political intentions behind the display of folk culture to both urban and rural audiences and brings attention to the question of integration of the diverse regional objects in a utopian national whole. The article thus also aims to demonstrate issues related to the use of folk artefacts for the purposes of cultural nationalism in Austria-Hungary in the late nineteenth century. © The Author [2011].

The paper aims to redefine the abstract concept of the lilong, arguing for their potential to be rethought as a typology of low–medium rise-high density (LMRHD) housing today. In particular, the paper delivers a practical answer to a conceptual question: how does lilong provide the dwelling identity of Shanghai, China, taking into account its form, meaning, and culture? The emergence of both lilong and Western modern housing is rooted in a crisis of space and the economic drive of modern cities. Lilong architecture and the normative living programme embedded in the typology of modern housing have been proper development housing strategies in modern Shanghai. By closely examining both the physical and community aspects that make lilong a mediating agency between Chinese locality and Western modernity, the paper presents the assumption that the architecture of lilong does not confine itself to certain forms or physical configurations; instead it is an “abstract concept” of an urban neighbourhood–the spatial organization, architectural practicality, casual formation of semi-private space, and community lane-life–a concept that should be taken into account for the design of urban housing today. The redefinition of lilong is a conceptual idea that will serve as a point of departure for the last part of the paper: a discussion of the possibility to develop this housing strategy for today's situation. This paper also presents the preliminary strategies for the designing of the new LMRHD housing. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Community planning; Housing development; Lilong; Shanghai urban housing; Social sustainable housing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958514390

The article briefly covers the history of how Cuzco's urban markets, located in the Andean highlands of southern Peru, were constituted and the reasons for the conflicts that emerged over where they should be located. It then examines how spatial considerations intervene in the kinds of practices that vendors, who are primarily women, have deployed in their everyday economic activities. Vendors' household and ecological models are drawn in part from Andean notions of vertical ecology and socioeconomic diversification, which entail strategic scheduling, migration, and a complex sexual and household division of labor. In turn, these practices contribute substantially to the particular designs and functions of marketplace activities. The article finally turns to the bitter political contestations among residents, vendors and municipal authorities over market spaces. The diverse tactics that vendors have developed to defend themselves incorporate their knowledge of urban spatial relations, gender and racial ideologies, the physical body itself, and legal measures. Money and commodities...were destined to bring with them not only a 'culture' but also a space. The uniqueness of the marketplace, doubtless on account of the splendor of religious and political structures, has tended to be overlooked. We should therefore remind ourselves that antiquity looked upon trade and trades-people as external to the city, as outside its political system, and so relegated them to the outskirts. The basis of wealth was still real property, ownership of the land. The medieval revolution brought commerce inside the town and lodged it at the center of a transformed urban space. The marketplace differed from the forum as from the agora: access to it was free, and it opened up on every side onto the surrounding territory...and into the countryside's network of roads and lanes. [The market hall's] function was to shelter the transaction of business while permitting the authorities to control it. The cathedral church was certainly not far away, but its tower no longer bore the symbols of knowledge and power; instead the freestanding campanile now dominated space, and would soon, as clock-tower, come to dominate time too... By the fourteenth century this space, known and recognized now, and hence representable, was able to generate purely symbolic towns, founded for the purposes of commerce in regions which were still exclusively agropastoral, and where consequently no commercial activity was as yet taking place (Lefebvre 1991: 265).",,"social construction; urban economy; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034087977

Similar trends hold when accounting for distance driven and the number of registered cars. This paper seeks to understand what is behind the road safety disparities between these two countries. The results suggest that a number of inter-related factors seem to play a role in the better road safety outcomes of Australia as compared to the US. This includes Australia's strategies related to seat belt usage and impaired driving as well as their efforts to help curb vehicle speeds and reduce exposure. Design-related differences include a much greater reliance on roundabouts and narrower street cross-sections as well as guidelines that encourage self-enforcing roads. Policy-related differences include stronger and more extensive enforcement programs, restrictive licensing programs, and higher driving costs. Combined with a more urban population and multimodal infrastructure, Australia tends to discourage driving mileage and exposure while encouraging safer modes of transportation such as transit, at least more so than in most of the US. Australia also enacted their version of Vision Zero – called the Safe System Approach – more than a decade before similar policies began cropping up in US cities. While it is difficult to attribute recent road safety successes to any specific policy, Australia continues to expand their lead on the US in terms of safety outcomes and is a road safety example worthy of consideration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment; Road safety; Safe system approach; Street and intersection design; Towards zero; Vision zero","Accident prevention; Land use; Roads and streets; Transportation; Urban transportation; Built environment; Intersection design; Road safety; System approach; Towards zero; Vision Zero; Motor transportation; Australia; car driving; comparative study; drunken driving; environmental planning; epidemiology; human; legislation and jurisprudence; licensing; mortality; procedures; safety; seatbelt; statistics and numerical data; traffic accident; traffic and transport; United States; utilization; Accidents, Traffic; Australia; Automobile Driving; Driving Under the Influence; Environment Design; Humans; Licensure; Safety; Seat Belts; Transportation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037994305

However, few studies have examined how these soundscapes can shift with the onset and progression of specific hearing impairments. This paper explores such shifts, drawing on a series of in-depth narrative interviews conducted in the south west of England with individuals diagnosed with Ménière’s disease; a long-term progressive vestibular disorder characterised by episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss and, for some people, hyperacusis (high sensitivity to sudden irregular sounds). Located in the subfield of ‘emotional geographies’, the paper discusses how participants were forced to connect with and attune to previously unremarkable aspects of their everyday soundscapes in ways that were both emotionally and socially challenging. Four aspects of participants’ embodied, emotional soundscapes are critically explored: hearing life in ‘2D’; corporeal and environmental ‘sonic intruders’; corporeal sound ‘symbols’; and seeking to regain a semblance of control through soundscape (re)-negotiations. Such insights are important to inform conscious acoustic design efforts that respect the ‘ears and voice’ of people living with varying levels of auditory sensitivity, rather than urban and community planning policies that continue to prioritise vision and transit. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emotional geographies; hearing impairment; Ménière’s disease; narrative interviews; Soundscapes; well-being","acoustics; culture; disease; geographical thought; hearing; social behavior; vision; England; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984688823

Moreover, while existing schemes in other regions could provide a better understanding about bicycle sharing, the need to improve our understanding of PBSP's role in catering for the local transportation mobility and accessibility needs and requirements as well as identifying strategies to make PBSP better adapted to local Asian condition is in order. To date, there has been limited information and analytics to inform low-carbon local planning especially from the perspective of variious individuals. To address this gap, this paper aims to advance our understanding of bike sharing schemes in Asia by examining motivators, constraints and opportunities, and their contribution towards achieving sustainable urban mobility outcomes. Using a survey-based research design approach, this study examines the perception of various individuals on the perceived benefits, and identify factors which have facilitated or constrained the implementation of PBSP. In essence, results show that technical constraints were perceived to be the most restrictive and dominant barriers while there is general consensus that different types of facilitators support bikeshare implementation; also, environmental benefits top the list of benefits while the lowest scorer is economic benefit, providing vital and important information to inform design, marketing and communication strategies for PBSP implementation within the Asian setting. This paper enhances our understanding of the challenges involved in bikeshare implementation as a first step in planning for a smarter society. It also attempts to build the evidence base to comprehend the localization of bike sharing schemes. Understanding how PBSP can be locally implemented can have long-term positive effects through creating a cycling culture and changing peoples' travel behaviors. © 2017 The Authors.

As a result the goal of design often becomes “fixing” or directing behavior and culture instead of letting culture happen. This outlook often prevents designers from engaging critically with culture, through representational space and spatial practice, as a crucial, possibly the most crucial, aspect in the design process. Just as human cultures interact to constantly reproduce and co-produce hybrid cultures, the professional designer and those users and experiencers of design (at whatever scale) must interact to co-produce spaces and places of activity. Through a critique of the practice of placemaking, we highlight the need to differentiate between participation and co-production. Understanding participation as one element of the design process and the role of design at larger scales of co-productive processes can help designers have a better understanding of how spaces are produced, and the role of designers in the creation of spaces of potentiality. Agam-ben’s writing on potentialities and Lefebvre’s spatial triad offer a theoretical framework to investigate the ethical role of professional designers in society while taking a critical stance against the singular solutions of modernist urban transformation. Spaces of Potentiality are seen here as a designer’s simultaneous withdrawal from rational problem solving and deterministic solutions, and an engagement with open source strategies for the co-production of urban space. © 2016 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Agamben; Autogestion; Co-production; Differential space; Lefebvre; Potentiality; Spatial triad",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041043085

To identify perceptions of how sociocultural environment enabled and hindered physical activity (PA) participation. Design. Community-based participatory research. Setting. Two semirural and two urban communities located in Alberta, Canada. Participants. Thirty-five people (74.3% females, 71.4% aged 25-64 years) across the four communities. Method. PhotoVoice activities occurred over 3 months during the spring of 2009. Participants were asked to document perceived environmental attributes that might foster or inhibit PA in their community. Photographs and narratives were shared in one-on-one interviews. Line-by-line coding of the transcripts was independently conducted by two researchers using an inductive approach. Codes were arranged into themes and subthemes, which were then organized into the Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to Obesity (ANGELO) framework. Results. Six main themes (accompanied by subthemes) emerged: sociocultural aesthetics, safety, social involvement, PA motivation, cultural ideas of recreation, and car culture. Representative quotes and photographs illustrate enablers and obstacles identified by participants. Conclusion. This PhotoVoice study revealed how aspects of participants' sociocultural environments shaped their decisions to be physically active. Providing more PA resources is only one step in the promotion of supportive environments. Strategies should also account for the beautification and maintenance of communities, increasing feelings of safety, enhancement of social support among community members, popularization of PA, and mitigating car culture, among others. © SAGE Publications.","Community-Based Participatory Research; Health Behavior; Health focus: physical activity; Health Promotion; Manuscript format: research; Outcome measure: environmental characteristics; Physical Activity; Prevention Research; Research purpose: descriptive; Setting: local community; Social Environment; Strategy: behavior change, policy, culture change, built and social environment, health promoting community design; Study design: qualitative; Target population age: youth, adults, seniors; Target population circumstances: geographic location","adult; Alberta; attitude to health; comparative study; demography; environment; exercise; female; health behavior; health promotion; human; male; middle aged; motivation; organization; organization and management; participatory research; procedures; psychology; rural population; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; urban population; Adult; Alberta; Attitude to Health; Community-Based Participatory Research; Environment; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Organizations; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975132371

Objective: Urbanization of the Ovahimba people in Namibia is associated with an increased prevalence of disorders of glucose metabolism, and may thus be attributed to changes of cortisol homeostasis. Design: A prospective, cross-sectional, diagnostic study was applied. Setting: The study was conducted in the field. Location of the Diabetes Epidemic: Africa and Namibia. Participants: Ovahimba people: group 1 ""urban"" n = 60, 42 females, 46.3 ± 11.3 years (town); group 2 ""rural"" n = 63, 44 females, 51.1 ± 12.0 years (seminomadic). Interventions: oGTT, sunrise and sunset saliva cortisol, metabolic parameters, questionnaire. Main Outcome Measure: The prevalence of disorders of glucose metabolism (DM, IGT, IFT). Results: The prevalence of disorders of glucose metabolism differed significantly: urban group n = 17(28.3%) vs rural group n = 8(12.7%)(P = 0.04). The saliva cortisol concentrations also differed significantly: sunrise 0.34 ± 0.18 vs 0.12 ± 0.15 μg/dL, sunset 0.18 ± 0.20 vs 0.07 ± 0.09 μg/dL, area under the curve 6.16 ±3.48 vs 2.28 ± 2.56 μg/dL∗24 h (all P < 0.001). Further metabolic parameters were unfavorably changed in the urban group: hip circumference (P < 0.001), waist circumference (P < 0.001), body mass index (P = 0.014), systolic BP at rest (P < 0.001), diastolic BP atrest (P = 0.002), systolic BP after exercise (P < 0.001), heart rate after exercise (P = 0.007), fasting glucose (P < 0.001),2-h-glucose by OGTT (P = 0.002), triglycerides (P = 0.04), HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.014), prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (P < 0.001). Physical activity was higher in the rural group, and intake of fast food and sweets were higher in the urban group. Conclusions: Urbanization of the Ovahimba people is associated with an increasing prevalence of disorders of glucose metabolism and other unfavorable metabolic parameters. Besides changes of lifestyle, this may be attributed to an increased cortisol exposure of the Ovahimba people living in an urban environment.

By and large, Mediterranean countries rely highly on offering a tourist product based on sea, sun, culture and nature. While the sea and sun are not affected by fire catastrophes, places of cultural and natural beauty are indeed hit; tourists end up being uninformed with no proper guidance from the firefighting authorities. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper attempts to highlight the relation between fire catastrophes and tourism development, to identify if and how state authorities take into account tourists in the planning and management of appropriate measures. A comparative study between Greece and Cyprus is presented. A number of interviews with stakeholders on the policy and operational level were conducted and the results and their implications are presented. Findings: Planning and suppression is complicated with a number of actors involved in various stages; national tourism organizations in both countries do not take part in the information or planning process. There is an emerging need for the provision of useful, comprehensive, practical information aimed at tourists. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the paper are based in a number of interviews with key policy makers as well as key operational commanders. The participation of the above in the policy making as well as operational phase shows a number of limitations. This paper presents a qualitative approach to the subject. A follow-up quantitative study is already planned. Practical implications: Lessons learnt from previous catastrophes, in-depth analysis of the existing ""modus operandi"" and ""rules of engagement"" should provide the necessary background for creating new risk-based, comprehensive, focused communication campaigns. Social implications: Safer societies and lower impact on the environment are the main outcomes of a concerted communication campaign. Tourism represents and multiplies the image of the country as a whole to the world; a solution to the problem would offer added value. Originality/value: The paper is based on a number of in-depth interviews with actors that took part in the actual handling of the two major catastrophes in Cyprus and Greece. The outcome of the interviews is presented for the first time. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cyprus; Forest fires; Greece; Planning process; Suppression effort; Tourism development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878834115

The essayists define modernization not only as the extension of industrialized building processes and urban infrastructure, but also as the spread of ideals of progress and standards of comfort-which is to say, modernization is the ideology as well as the built framework for the administration of industrial societies. Architecture can help consolidate identity by providing both a degree of social cohesion and iconic forms that can become a source of pride for communities. Yet, for others, such architectural forms can become stereotypes that flatten culture into amere sign.Throughout these essays, one discerns an abiding concern for questions of representation, for how buildings and monuments-or in some cases, the lack of them- acquiremeaning, harden conviction, and set the spatial infrastructure for subsequent generations. The Middle East, with its diverse social, religious, and national histories, has often been seen by architects and academics as rich in traditional architecture but poor as a resource for understanding the Modern period. Europeans have idealized the Middle East as an almost timeless place, a region that stands in distinct and didactic contrast with the disruptive displacement and disillusionment that has resulted from its own industrialization.1 These essays describe the unique ways by which Middle Eastern countries have invented their own versions of modernism, sometimes aligned and sometimes at odds with more familiar European versions, and in varying relations with larger patterns of imperialism and colonialism. When individual designers and decision makers crossed national borders to build or to learn, to provide aid or extract resources, as architects, teachers, or tourists, the dichotomies of modern-traditional orWestern-Eastern did not truly hold. Our goal here is to build into the study of transnational architectural exchange the widest consideration of constituencies and the most extended opportunities for input.Contributors examine awide range of cultural encounters in terms of institutionalization of relationships, dynamic interactions of bureaucratic structures, and patterns of patronage amid debates over design and urban planning. Even local histories aremultiple, often disputed in their formation, and inevitably shifting over time. Taken together, they illustrate the various strategies that set national policies and decidewho is housed and who goes wanting, who is remembered and who is forgotten, and who is empowered to remake the built landscape. Several essays profile the individuals who helped realize certain specificallyMiddle Eastern forms of modernity. Some of them, such as European art historians and expatriate architects and archeologists, positioned themselves as the arbiters of Western knowledge, while others were seen as importingWestern ideals and technologies to theMiddle East. In other cases, institutions, such as governments or development agencies, assumed these roles. In many instances, however, cultural authority was as much a matter of dynamic transitions in political or architectural sympathies as it was the result of official credentials. These essays call attention to circuits of intention and response, which inflamed allegedly objective depictions of technological progress into heated debates regarding the nature of modernity itself. Modernism and the Middle East contextualizes the challenges facing building efforts today by placing themwithin a larger historical trajectory stretching from colonialism and the rise of nation-states to the present postcolonial search for local identity.By detailing howarchitecture has been integral to complex political ambitions and economic programs, the contributors make evident the historical roles played by competing visions of the built environment, as forms of representation and as ameans of directing capital and labor flows. With such attention to its deep traditions and rapidmodernization, the Middle East emerges as a rich setting for the study of modern architecture. Modernism and the Middle East begins at the cusp of the twentieth century amid the decline of colonialism and the rise of independent nation-states in regions once ruled by theOttomans (r. 1290-1924) in present-day Turkey and North Africa, and the Qajars (r. 1779-1924) in Iran (see fig. I.1).2 Under the dynastic leadership of the Sultan, overseer of the holy sites of Mecca andMedina and the supreme ruler of the Sunni Islamic world, the relatively stable and unified Ottoman Empire had administeredmuch of today's Middle East. But this administrative unity and geographic cohesion was eroded greatly during the nineteenth century, and it dissolved completely in the twentieth.3 Beyond the actual loss of land, Ottoman rule was disrupted by major infrastructure developments, most notably the Suez Canal (1854-69), which brought French and, later, English capital and technology to Egypt.4 By the twilight of World War I, in 1918, Istanbul had itself come under Allied control, and the six-hundred-year-oldOttoman Empire came to an end, its former lands divided into areas administered by the French (Syria and Lebanon) and the British (Iraq and Palestine).5 Even as newnations emerged with at least nominal sovereignty from the Mandate period, the idea of a coherent, if not exactly cohesive, Middle East was reinforced. The Mandates carved new political entities, such as Palestine and Iraq, out of former Ottoman administrative zones, but it kept these nations from being fully independent, and left them wanting in terms of industrial development. At the same time, European occupation sparked nationalist movements in neighboring Turkey and Iran, resulting in the overthrow of puppet monarchies and the rise of charismatic military leaders,who threwoff centuries of imperial rule and modernized in the name of national progress. The advent of Mustafa Kemal in Turkey (1919) and Riza Khan in Iran (1921) brought new modes of judicial and educational reforms (often based on European models), in an effort to forge homogeneous, if fictive, native identities.6 The characterization of entire peoples by their positions along the trajectory of history and modernization was asmuch embraced by regional leaders as it was imposed by European power and ideology. Oil came to be written into this idea of a cohesive Middle East as much by its discovery there as by the increasing industrial thirst for sources of fuel. The image of Arab states unified by oceans of oil lying unseen beneath their soil emerged in the nineteenth centurywith the advent of a British-controlled Anglo-Persian oil company. It was extended as new fields were discovered, such as those in Iraq in the 1930s and those in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia by 1945. With the institution of the American's Marshall Plan (1948-52), the European economy was reconfigured according to American precepts, resulting in an emphasis on continued growth in productivity and an even greater dependence on oil. The Middle East thus moved to the center of foreign-policy strategies for a number of Western nations, becoming also a site of contentious ideological positioning between the Soviet Union and the United States, with both nations acting out their political differences through technical aid and development projects as well as cultural exports. Although some small Persian Gulf monarchies enjoyed considerable advantages over their oil-poor neighbors, toWesterners the regionmaintained its conceptual integrity as a site of superpower struggle and vast economic opportunity.7 The creation of the state of Israel, on May 14, 1948, also helped consolidate an idea of the Middle East, albeit in a way unanticipated by mostWestern politicians. Although Jewish immigration to the area in the first half of the twentieth century had profoundly accected the economic and demographic character of Mandate Palestine, the United Nations' 1947 plan to partition the area into Jewish and Arab states,whichwas rejected by the Arab League, formed in 1945, seemed only to reassert Western colonialism at the very moment it was breaking apart elsewhere. Within this context, theMiddle Eastmust be historically situated as a place defined both by European colonial interests and by the specific imperial configurations that had existed in the region. Just as the specter of essentialism hovers over the term ""Middle East,"" one may argue that it also haunts the idea of a homogeneous ""Europe""; nonetheless, as Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued in another context, these terms highlight, rather than obfuscate, the problematic of domination and intellectual dependency that permeates any discussion of these two entities.8 The interdependency of Europe and the Middle East can be seen in the unfolding of an ""Oriental"" supplement to European identity: what was understood by nineteenth-century policymakers as the ""Eastern question"" had to do less with the inhabitants of these regions than with the raw currency of human labor and material wealth promised through imperialism. © 2008 by University of Washington Press.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on summary case findings, the ethno-methodological approach has provided a consumer-based focus via the use of narratives which have helped to build pictures on routine aspects of this social phenomenon for analysis. Findings - The study has highlighted a number of emergent issues and patterns pertinent to this popular sector as it infiltrates Scottish society. The addictive mix of quality products, sophisticated packaging, high levels of personal service with added social and environmental scruples have led to phenomenal growth in the postmodern Scottish urban landscape. Scottish consumers has become daily devotees to the designer cup with 83 per cent claiming that this type of consumption is fuelled by lifestyle considerations. Research limitations/implications - Fieldwork was facilitated by nominated access in four branded operations across four Scottish cities. Controlled conditions were employed to facilitate generalization with further research desirable over a wider timeframe to allow evaluation of potential relationships between gender, geography and usage patterns. Practical implications - Implications for the ubiquitous Scottish public house are clear in that there is evidence of competition with the branded coffee sector in terms of share of discretionary leisure spend. This, coupled with the apparently increasing feminization of social space with its preference for clean, healthy and positive lifestyle choices as opposed to the negative, predominantly male dominance of Scottish pub culture, indicates potential decline and further gender segregation at a time when companies are trying to involve the family more in the public house market. Originality/value - This paper will be of interest to anyone who has pondered life over a cup of designer coffee in or from a branded outlet and wondered whatever one did before the advent of this US-led revolution which people have adopted and adapted as their own brand of café culture. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Coffee; Consumption; Culture (sociology); Hospitality services; Lifestyles; Scotland",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644592658

Moreover, it reorients our thinking about art museums in the United States, demonstrating that there were important democratic, utilitarian, and civic impulses at work behind them. The book also broadens our thinking about progressivism, reminding us how it shaped art museums and how those museum-related programs it spawned continued beyond World War I.""-Steven Conn, author of Do Museums Still Need Objects? American art museums of the Gilded Age were established as civic institutions intended to provide civilizing influences to an urban public, but the parochial worldview of their founders limited their democratic potential. Instead, critics have derided nineteenth-century museums as temples of spiritual uplift far removed from the daily experiences and concerns of common people. But in the early twentieth century, a new generation of cultural leaders revolutionized ideas about art institutions by insisting that their collections and galleries serve the general public. Things American: Art Museums and Civic Culture in the Progressive Era tells the story of the civic reformers and arts professionals who brought museums from the realm of exclusivity into the progressive fold of libraries, schools, and settlement houses. Jeffrey Trask's history focuses on New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which stood at the center of this movement to preserve artifacts from the American past for social change and Americanization. Metropolitan trustee Robert de Forest and pioneering museum professional Henry Watson Kent influenced a wide network of fellow reformers and cultural institutions. Drawing on the teachings of John Dewey and close study of museum developments in Germany and Great Britain, they expanded audiences, changed access policies, and broadened the scope of what museums collect and display. They believed that tasteful urban and domestic environments contributed to good citizenship and recognized the economic advantages of improving American industrial production through design education. Trask follows the influence of these people and ideas through the 1920s and 1930s as the Met opened its innovative American Wing while simultaneously promoting modern industrial art. Things American is not only the first critical history of the Metropolitan Museum. The book also places museums in the context of the cultural politics of the progressive movement-illustrating the limits of progressive ideas of democratic reform as well as the boldness of vision about cultural capital promoted by museums and other cultural institutions.

This distinctive opportunity has lead the authors to explore a form of design brief and virtual design studio (VDS) format not well addressed in the literature. Instead of sharing the same design brief, students in this alternative format design a project in the other students' city and do not collaborate on the same design. Collaboration with other students takes the form of teaching each other about the city and culture served by the design. The authors discovered these studios produce a focus on site context that serves our pedagogical objectives - a blend of architectural, landscape architectural and urban design knowledge. Their students use a range of commercial CAD and computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) software common to that used in many VDS experiments reported on in the literature. However, this conventional use of technology is contrasted with a second distinctive characteristic of these studios, the use of custom software tools specifically designed to support synchronous and asynchronous three-dimensional model exchange and linked attribute knowledge. The paper analyzes some of the virtual design studio (VDS) work between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the University of Toronto, and the University of Melbourne.

To better understand these disparities, this study aims to examine the social determinants of self-reported health for indigenous peoples in Canada. Study design: This study uses data from Statistics Canada's Aboriginal Peoples Survey 2012. Methods: Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine how selected social determinants of health are associated with self-reported health among off-reserve First Nations and Métis peoples in Canada. Results: Our analysis shows that being older, female, and living in urban settings were significantly associated with negative ratings of self-reported health status among the indigenous respondents. Additionally, we found that higher income and levels of education were strongly and significantly associated with positive ratings of self-reported health status. Compared with indigenous peoples with an education level of grade 8 or lower, respondents with higher education were 10 times (5.35–22.48) more likely to report ‘excellent’ and ‘very good’ health. Respondents who earned more than $40,000 annually were three times (2.17–4.72) more likely to report ‘excellent’ and ‘very good’ health compared with those who earned less than $20,000 annually. When interacted with income, we also found that volunteering in the community is associated with better self-reported health. Conclusions: There are known protective determinants (income and education) and risk determinants (location of residence, gender, and age) which are associated with self-reported health status among off-reserve First Nations and Métis peoples. For indigenous-specific determinants, volunteering in the community appears to be associated with self-perceived health status. Thus, addressing these determinants will be necessary to achieve better health outcomes for indigenous peoples in Canada. Next steps include developing indigenous-specific social determinants of health indicators that adequately measure culture, connection, and community. © 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health","Indigenous peoples; Public health; Self-reported health; Social determinants of health","educational attainment; health status; income; indigenous population; public health; regression analysis; urban area; adult; article; Canada; controlled study; education; female; First Nation; gender; human; human experiment; male; outcome assessment; public health; social determinants of health; statistics; study design; American Indian; Canada; ethnology; middle aged; public health service; questionnaire; self report; social determinants of health; socioeconomics; young adult; Canada; Adult; Canada; Female; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged; Public Health Practice; Self Report; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045581825

However, recent studies have shown that patients with palliative care needs experience benefits being in hospital. Little is known about how experiences of benefit and burden vary according to socio-demographic and illness-related factors and how these experiences influence patient preferences to return to hospital. Aim: To identify factors influencing experiences of benefit and burden and the predictors associated with a preference to return to hospital in palliative care. Design: Cross-sectional design using a questionnaire survey. Setting/participants: In total, 116 hospital inpatients admitted with palliative care needs in an urban hospital in New Zealand. Recruitment was from an oncology ward, four general medical wards and a respiratory ward. Results: Those living in more deprived areas experienced more benefit being in hospital (F(4, 109) = 3.15, p = 0.017), while younger people (F(4, 109) = 4.44, p = 0.00) and those from Asian or Pacific cultures (F(2, 111) = 7.78, p = 0.000) experienced more burden. Those with a non-cancer diagnosis felt less safe in hospital (p = 0.04). ‘Feeling safe’ was a significant (B = 0.14, p = 0.03) predictor for a preference to return to hospital. Conclusion: Deprivation, diagnosis, age and ethnicity influenced experiences of benefit and burden in hospital. ‘Feeling safe’ was a significant predictor for a preference to return to hospital. Further research is needed to understand why certain patient factors influence experiences of hospitalisation and how ‘feeling safe’ can be replicated in other care environments. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","hospital admissions; hospitalisations; Palliative care; patient preferences","adult; article; cross-sectional study; diagnosis; ethnicity; female; hospital admission; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; oncology ward; palliative therapy; patient preference; questionnaire; adolescent; aged; hospital; hospitalization; middle aged; palliative therapy; patient preference; patient safety; psychology; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hospitalization; Hospitals, Urban; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Palliative Care; Patient Preference; Patient Safety; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042088918

Over the last couple of decades, urban areas in China context have been engaged in increasing initiatives and practices with views to facilitate people's lives and intensively utilize land resources. Echoing with these, the complex urban public spaces (CUPSs) with multi-layer structure integrated in three-dimensional space have been constructed in many cities, such as the integrated railway transport hub, airport terminal, and commercial complex. The CUPSs facilitate people's traffic transfer and satisfy people's multi-commercial functions requirements. However, the CUPSs are also subject to many kinds of risk events due to complex structure, crowded people in each layer and openness. Resilience is a kind of ability to resist risks, absorb the damage of risk events, and recover to normal operation situation, which presents high importance for the risk reduction. Gaining resilience and enhancing risk resistance ability of CUPSs are indispensable but indeed difficult as it is determined by lots of influencing indicators. In response, this paper intends to conduct a research on the exploration of key indicators for the resilience of CUPSs. Content analysis, expert investigation, and Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) will be adopted for the identification, analysis, and contribution evaluation of the key indicators. Prospectively, the key indicators in a sound taxonomy to break down the resilience will be obtained. The main findings of this research could provide useful references for governors and policy makers to enhance the resilience of CUPSs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Complex urban public space; Indicator system; Resilience","Analytic hierarchy process; History; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Complex structure; Indicator system; Multilayer structures; Public space; Railway transport; Resilience; Three dimensional space; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021765436

Students learned to analyze these sites for issues of authorship; design; intended audience; ideology; and political, social, and profit motive agendas. Based in theories from new literacies, multiliteracies, multimodal literacy, and critical media literacy, the article addresses the following questions: What understandings as critical readers of popular culture websites did the students exhibit? How did these understandings contribute to their development as 21st-century literate people? Through the use of screen capture software and think-aloud protocol, we were able to recreate each student's reading process. Students then created alternative media productions using Glogster. We analyzed each student's glog using the grammar of visual design. Analysis revealed students' critical media literacy understandings. We present 3 themes in the findings: inferential thinking, a dialectic across multiple literacies, and multimodal expression.

As an example of this development, public and university libraries are studied from the point of view of teleworking. Although work still only accounts for a small amount of the activities that take place in libraries, its transformations can be seen as a 'weak signal' of newly emerging spatial arrangements. In addition to the home and workplace, teleworkers are using a network of public, semi-public and private spaces (so-called third places) for different types of working. The research used the concept ""spatial portfolio"" to address this phenomenon of spatial modalities. The new role of public libraries within this context is discussed. In addition to their traditional functions of lending books and providing spaces for reading newspapers and magazines, libraries are now becoming more multifunctional, providing space for different activities, including work. This new phenomenon has been studied empirically by conducting a qualitative interview and observing teleworkers in two public libraries and one university library in the City of Helsinki, Finland. The objective was to find and analyze different profiles of workers in libraries, thus providing input for future planning and design of these spaces, as well as the urban fabric around them. The results show that a considerable range of activities within research and education, art and culture, information technology, business and finance, and social services and government are performed in the libraries, all of which are in part supported by the new concepts and policies of the city. Libraries can be seen as 'transitory workspaces' where people work at least a couple of hours per week and for different reasons such as free wifi connection and location. Also, libraries might be considered 'spatial incubators' or rather places able to attract people who start up their own activities. These concepts contribute to define a new way of appropriating libraries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930571168

Influenza is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract. In Indonesia, numerous number of Avian-Influenza (H5N1) cases occurred in rural area, such as cases in Garut, Jawa Barat in 2006 which started in Cikelet district causing 14 infected-cases and 5 death-cases and has put Garut in an emergency situation until 2010. The H5N1 detection in rural area requires fast yet accurate diagnosis result to enable immediate curative actions. The most accurate result is provided by RT-PCR (Reverse-Transcription Polymerase-Chain-Reaction), which is high investment, and usually locates in urban area. Another diagnostic tool, rapid diagnostic test, is most common tool but gives inaccurate result because of its low sensitivity and specificity. In case of Tuberculosis, Indonesia ranks number 3, after India and China, as a country with most number of infected-people. Symptoms are chronic-cough with blood-tinged-sputum, fever, night-sweats and weight-loss. Tuberculosis is diagnosed by identifying Mycobacterium-tuberculosis organism in clinical sample. When this is not possible, probable diagnosis may be made using imaging X-rays or scans, tuberculin skin test and/or Interferon-Gamma-Release-Assay (IGRA). The main problem with tuberculosis diagnosis is difficulty in culturing this slow-growing organism in laboratory, which may take 4 to 12 weeks for blood or sputum-culture. The requirement is to create a first-hand diagnostic tool which allows paramedic mobility to rural areas for Influenza/Tuberculosis diagnostic purposes. The study first introduces lung auscultation method, then analysis and preliminary design of lung diseases diagnosis software.

In this study, a sustainable relief housing prototype that aided in sheltering homeless citizens was designed. To avoid repeating errors in urban development such as unsustainable resource consumption, it was necessary to look beyond traditional construction materials and methods. Approach: This design applied cradle to cradle design model to the earthbag construction technique and developed a prototype for sustainable relief housing in Ethiopia. Results: Based on environmental and human health, all materials selected for construction were naturally occurring and could safely return to nature after use. Structural design maximized natural energy use and housing and interior design considered the local culture in Ethiopia. Conclusion: With locally available materials, inexpensive construction, maintenance and use, this design provided affordable shelter for the Ethiopian people. Material selection ensured the most effective use of material resources, no synthetic material and toxin deposition and the best indoor air quality for human health. Using earthbags rather than wood for the structure, this housing design helped prevent deforestation and the resulting desertification in Ethiopia. © 2009 Science Publications.","Cradle to cradle; Earthbag; Ethiopia; Relief housing; Sustainable","architectural design; construction material; construction method; desertification; energy use; homelessness; housing; poverty; public health; sustainable development; urban development; urbanization; Africa; East Africa; Ethiopia; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-64649100165

Design Data from a self-identified urban First Nations population were collected using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). As no clear approach for regression modelling of RDS data is available, two logistic regression modelling approaches, including survey-based logistic and generalised linear mixed models, were used to explore the relationship between diabetes and health barriers of interest, including access to healthcare, food, housing and socioeconomic factors. Setting Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Participants This cross-sectional study used data collected from the Our Health Counts study, in partnership with the De dwa da dehs nye>s Aboriginal Health Centre, which recruited 554 First Nations adults living in Hamilton using RDS. Results After adjusting for covariates, multivariable regression techniques showed a statistically significant relationship between a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes and a lack of culturally appropriate care among urban First Nations peoples (OR: 12.70, 95% CI 2.52 to 57.91). There was also a trend towards a relationship between diabetes and not having a doctor available in the area, feeling that healthcare provided was inadequate and a lack of available healthcare services in the area. Conclusions Urban First Nations peoples who felt the health service they received was not culturally appropriate were more likely to have diabetes, compared with those who did not feel the service they received was culturally inappropriate. Establishing more healthcare services that integrate First Nations cultures and traditions could improve access to care and the course of treatment for urban First Nations peoples living with diabetes. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Kopcińskiego 31, Łódź, 90-142, Poland","Creation of the built environment and research in this field pose a particularly difficult challenge nowadays. The pace of social and technological change does not allow for evolutionary development of cities and the formation of their land use according to current conditions. Creating spatial solutions that are unmatched in their contexts is becoming not only possible, but very probable (see Alexander, 1964). The development of the built environment involves not only art, technology, history, economics and law, but also philosophy, culture, medicine, psychology, sociology and many other spheres in which human life is manifested. However, only a relatively small number of disciplines such as spatial planning, urban design, urban planning, etc. (ignoring at this point the differences in the meaning of the concepts) in their application layer are meant to create space and bear responsibility for it. Also society has certain requirements of practical nature towards them. This article attempts to outline the nature of research on space urbanised by people and to determine the four main fields of research aimed at the problems of man and the built environment. In the next part, particular attention is paid to issues related to the impact of the built environment on the life of its residents in order to highlight the particular role and complexity of this area of research. This study, acting as a kind of test of the research, cannot be considered representative. Nevertheless, the analysis prompts several reflections on the current and future role of the built environment in the development of our civilisation, as well as further challenges related to it. © 2016 European Spatial Research and Policy 2016.","built environment; physical environment; quality of life; spatial planning; urban planning","building; land use change; quality of life; research method; social change; spatial analysis; spatial planning; technological change; urban design; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014716623

The negative consequences that commercial signs can have on the visual quality of urban areas and further more, on people's quality of life, has been studied from both architectural, planning and psychological perspectives. While the issue of visual pollution, as this phenomenon is commonly described, has been widely debated, there is as yet no clear conclusion as to how best to control commercial signage and whether different urban contexts and people from different backgrounds and cultures have universal or distinct preferences. Several different commenrcial signage approaches are currently applied to different historic cities, but these initiatives are not based on principles derived from the perception and evaluation of users. Drawing on a range of comparative and contrasting empirical studies of historic city centres in the UK and Brazil, this book examines questions of commercial signage control management, the preservation of historic heritage and user preference and satisfaction. The author takes an environment behaviour approach to this research, involving theories, concepts and methodologies related to environmental psychology, architecture, planning and urban design. In doing so, it argues that there are in fact visual preferences common to the majority of people, independent of their urban context and that these common views can be useful to the development of a general theory of how to control commercial signage. In conclusion, the book suggests that the best way of controlling signage is not only to recommend general guidelines related to the operation of commercial signage, but also to recommend design principles that can create commercial streetscapes evaluated positively by different users. © 2014 adriana Portella.

This study focuses on within-culture variations of epistemic thinking, with the assumption that social change will produce changes in development. Arab society in Israel has undergone notable change over the last half century. In this cross-sectional research design, cross-generational comparison and rural–urban comparison were used as proxies for longitudinal social change. Three generations of Muslim Arab women in a village in Israel (20 adolescents, 20 mothers and 20 grandmothers) and 20 Muslim Arab adolescents from a large, mixed city in the same region responded to six dilemmas invoking epistemic thinking. Village adolescents were more subjectivist than their mothers and grandmothers. Sociodemographic characteristics representing greater exposure to diverse people and ideas accounted for generational differences. Both urban and rural adolescents tended towards subjectivist perspectives, and they did not differ. Parents’ education levels emerged as the sociodemographic variables most consistently related to epistemic thinking.

Developing strategies based on indigenous urban forms which embody local peoples' culture, aspirations, experiences, and values is consistent with the concept of sustainable urban development.

Design: A cross-sectional study was used. Participants/Settings: 419 participants were chosen by systematic stratified sampling; people between 60-96 years of age (mean age 70.2 years); 68.3 % female, and 31.7% male of Chonburi Province (Thailand). Measurements: To determine the elderly perception about the benefits of herbal medicine consumption, a scale from one to four based upon 12 simply worded item check lists was used among the others. The questionnaires were conducted in June to August 2008 in 3 different regions (urban, suburban and rural areas). Results: 97.4% having used herbal medicines in many ways. Most of the elderly used the local herbals together with conventional medicines. They believed that herbals could reduce expenses (51%), cure diseases (41.9%), relieve symptoms (35.4%), and provide good health (33.6%). A 16.7% of the elderly had the strongest opinion regarding the use of herbal medicines as substitutes for conventional medicines. They also strongly agreed on using them as nutrients (39.8%). The study found significant correlation among levels of education, stress levels, happiness levels, and perception of benefits of herbal medicine consumption. Conclusions: This study indicated that levels of education, happiness, and stress could influence the perception of herbal medicine consumption. Knowing how people perceive herbal medicine, its use, and local culture can help practicing health professionals, among other things, to avoid side effects from prescriptions and so maintain or promote the elderly health status. © 2011 Serdi and Springer Verlag France.","health promotion; Herbal medicine consumption; thai elderly","herbaceous agent; plant extract; adult; aged; allopathy; article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drug cost; drug use; educational status; female; happiness; Health Perceptions Questionnaire; health status; herbal medicine; human; male; mental stress; nutrient; perception; priority journal; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027954028

In the 1950s and 1960s, a conversation arose between government officials, social science experts, and the local press about how to fix social inequalities by 'ordering' mostly black and mulato, economically dispossessed families residing in shantytowns and barrios. This led to the establishment of caseríos (housing projects) as places where the government would attempt to 'modernize' residents through architectural design, planning, and social betterment programs. Because the caseríos did not address the structural causes of inequalities of power and wealth in the island, they failed in lifting residents out of poverty. From the mid-1960s onwards, a host of writings blamed caserío dwellers for the failure of the projects, attributing it to their purportedly dysfunctional - and nearly incorrigible - 'culture of poverty'. This perpetuated a particular characterization of Puerto Rican economically dispossessed people as incapable of political or social agency without the guidance of elite Puerto Ricans and the 'benevolent' American colonial metropolis. It also led to the subsequent 'bordering' of caseríos spaces with walls and checkpoints, which in turn reproduced the branding of public housing residents as irreparably dysfunctional and 'criminal'. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Caserío; Colonialism; Culture of poverty; Luis muñoz Marín; Modernization; Public housing; Puerto Rico; Racial democracy; San Juan; Shantytown","colonialism; genealogy; housing policy; housing project; modernization; poverty; social impact; state role; twentieth century; urban housing; Puerto Rico; San Juan [Puerto Rico]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951251395

Most were also fluent in Plains Indian sign language, some in one or more neighboring languages, and only several in English. By 2005 less than approximately 7 percent of the more than six thousand members of the tribe remained fluent in Arapaho. As Salzmann (1998:287) confirms, language shift has progressed to what can be defined as an irreversible stage. At present all remaining fluent speakers are bilingual and members of at least the grandparental generation. The age discrepancy in fluency varies with family and individual childrearing contexts, but only several people under the age of seventy remain fluent. Today, all children acquire English as their first language. In all social domains English predominates except in educational contexts for language renewal, ceremonial speech, and occasional interaction among elders. When elders are together they sporadically switch to Arapaho but generally only for a few exchanges as a speech event unfolds. Despite concerted efforts over the past twentyfive years, language renewal programs have produced no fluent speakers among younger generation students studying it as a second language in formal educational contexts. In the Northern Arapaho speech community the process of language shift over the past seventy years, and more recent efforts in the past three decades to reverse it, have been concomitant with a proliferation of competing and converging language ideologies. During the same history the Wind River Reservation social landscape and temporal order have changed dramatically. During my first continuous field study of 1988-94 I participated in many language and cultural education programs and was thus daily immersed in discourse articulating these ideologies. As Arapaho people talked about elements or the whole of language(s), I came to realize that the ideologies expressed were efforts to understand and resolve contradictions generated by the dramatically changing environment beyond language itself. Older fluent speakers today comment, often with a profound sense of loss, that they have few opportunities in their daily lives to speak Arapaho with others. With modern ordering of space-time, the vast majority of elders live in nuclear or extended domestic social spaces in which they are the single speaker or only one among several fluent senior relatives. Those who participate in interviews and educational programs often mentioned to me that they looked forward to such rare times to speak the language and connect with others in their own generation. As many observe, language shift is not just a demographic process of declining numbers of speakers but also a process of contracting ""domains"" of usage (Fishman 1972:440-53) or sites of cultural production (Silverstein 1998b:138). Language or speech does not, however, construct the social space and time of its use sui generis. As I explain elsewhere (Anderson 1998:51-52), domains themselves are equally constituted by the interdimensionality of time and space on a number of levels. The socially constructed spaces and time orientations in which Arapaho people live, such as ceremony, home, school, political discourse, and economic activity, have all changed significantly in history, both in the ways sites reproduce social relations internally and in the speech practices that link the domains together. Borrowing a useful term from Giddens, it is insightful to examine speech practices and reflective ideologies relative to ""time-space zones"" as individuals and groups move through ""time-space paths"" (1987:146) in daily life and trajectories of larger extension, such as the annual calendar, life cycle, and family history. What is needed is more attention in anthropology to the way communities change their speech practices in response to constructed changes in the physical and social environment. Built environments can enhance or inhibit any social practices, whether by design or unintentionally (Lawrence and Low 1990:461). More generally, as Harvey recognizes, imposed orders of space and time are the principal apparatus of ""conquest, imperial expansion, and neocolonial domination"" (1990:419). Following Foucault (1984:252), it can be said that governments exert power through built forms in a process of canalization, the control of the flow and distribution of individual bodies in space. With respect to time, Munn states, ""Control over time is not just a strategy of interaction; it is a medium of hierarchic power and governance"" (1992:109). Top-down-imposed orders of space and time were alien to indigenous peoples and as a whole were the primary apparatus for transforming the system of social reproduction, including language and culture. It is therefore essential to examine ways Arapaho people have tried to appropriate those structures, construct new structures, or adapt traditional ones to invent or sustain language and culture. In Native American history, dominant ideologies and their instantiation in local space-time orientation have never been coherently hegemonic. Approaches to language ideologies must steer theory away from reified social forces or hegemony toward an understanding of competing and historically shifting ideologies, which Friedrich defines as ""pragmatic ideologies"" (1989:300-302), grounded in the particular, concrete practices in local, socially constructed spaces and time orientations. Rather than blending, though, Euro-American oppressive and progressive ideologies have generated enduring contradictions in a hybridized chaos unique to the space-time of reservation communities in the United States. Wind River, like other reservations, is largely a constructed environment (Lawrence and Low 1990) always in the making and remaking, shaped by state policies that shift precipitously among competing, evolving ideologies that never congeal into a coherent or uniform system of thought qualifying as hegemony any group can embrace or resist in total. Thus, Arapaho language has shifted to English in a history in which, as Althusser recognized, ""the locus of confrontation may vary according to the relation of the contradictions in the structure in dominance in any given situation"" (1969:215-16). Dominant language ideologies are therefore neither wholly uniform nor explicitly durable within a speech community undergoing shift. At one level, language shift on reservations took place in a social space-time different from that of other groups, such as urban or transnational immigrant ethnic groups. State-sponsored shifting utopian models in reservation history have resulted in a local heterotopian space-time (Foucault 1986). The contradiction between utopian missions of integration and heterotopian realities of sequestration provides the material for many local language ideologies. As discussed below in more detail, Arapaho language ideologies negotiate but never resolve the contradictions between a utopian language renewal mission and the objective reality of shift as an irreversible process, between the utopian model of Euro-American education as the universalizable solution to all problems and the impoverished local political economy, and between idealized nostalgic purism within Arapaho ideologies and the proliferation of modern technologies and bureaucratic apparatuses of communication and governance. In the relatively new study of language shift there has been a tendency to remain unreflexive about the social scientific ideological ground and spatiotemporal constructions that support it (Collins 1998:259). To borrow Phillipson's terms, models of shift are often ""bedeviled by myths and binary over-simplifications"" (1992:23). Today there is no permanent, closed, ""us versus them"" border to contest, no singular Euro-American ideology set against a singular Arapaho language ideology, and there probably never has been. Beginning in the 1880s, for example, competing Euro-American ideologies approached the Arapaho speech community with contradictory purposes, such that repression reigned in some time-space zones, while acceptance and even valorization applied in others. In the mission boarding school at St. Stephens children were barred from speaking Arapaho in the classroom, but in chapel the priests and brothers spoke Arapaho with the aim of conversion. By the 1890s and early 1900s other Euro-Americans arrived to research the very language and culture that federal agents sought to eradicate. Dimensions of space and time interrelate to define language ideologies in four correlative ways, which I explore in the rest of this chapter. First, competing dominant culture ideologies have imposed orders of space and time on the reservation as solutions to the ""Indian problem,"" reflecting a range of dominant ideologies toward American Indians, from extreme racism to progressive compassion. Beginning with the first relation, as Deloria suggests, ""It is debatable which factor was most important in the destruction of tribal ceremonial life: The prohibition of performances of traditional rituals by the government, or the introduction of white man's system of keeping time"" (1985:18). The same statement applies if language prohibition is inserted and the effects of time for restructuring space appended. It is not enough to situate language loss and ideological frames about it in the narrow spaces, policies, or historical moments wherein Arapaho language has been openly repressed. © 2009 by University of Arizona Press.

Most housing environments, particularly those produced on the basis of mass production systems, are missing vital aspects of sustainability and lack environmental and humane qualities, both at urban and architectural levels. It is essential to focus on the requirements of sustainable development, both as a philosophy of planning and design and during the process of making and managing our environments. Current urban and architectural development practices in Cyprus cannot be considered sustainable. However, traditional settlements on Cyprus, such as the vernacular patterns, are excellent examples to learn from as they represent a long-established culture and good use of local values and resources, matched with local skills meeting people's needs. This paper first focuses on what sustainability means in terms of housing environments by highlighting the qualities of traditional housing patterns in Cypriot settlements. Second, it provides a critical evaluation of newly developed housing patterns on the island in terms of the environment and traditions. Finally, it proposes principles of sustainable planning and design whose main aim is to create buildings that are sensitive to people and the environment and are culturally specific.","Cyprus; Housing; New housing patterns; Old housing patterns; Sustainability","architectural design; building construction; environmental management; environmental quality; housing conditions; island; sustainability; sustainable development; Asia; Cyprus; Eurasia; Middle East",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47549118650

The HIV positive prevalence rate, estimated at 23% in urban areas and 8% in rural areas, is one of the highest in the world (AIDSEC, 1994:1). Evaluation of counselling practices showed poor results with counsellors feeling ineffective and inadequate. Patients are mostly tested on medical indication but patients who do not see the benefit of knowing their HIV status increasingly refuse testing. The counselling practise as it is known in the Western world is a foreign concept for patients living in rural Malawi. The high stigma of AIDS complicates support of the patients. The goal of the research study was to describe a model of counselling that would meet the needs of an AIDS patient in rural community in Malawi. A qualitative research design that was explorative, descriptive and contextually specific to rural Malawi was used for the study. In order to describe a counselling model it was important to understand the illness experience of HIV reactive patients. The patients are seen in group context congruent with the African culture and therefore the experience of the primary care giver of AIDS patients is explored as the other major factor in the phenomenon examined. One phase of the research is described in this article namely exploring and describing the experience of the HIV reactive patient in rural Malawi. Results show that patients are in an advanced stage of AIDS when they are diagnosed and complain of weakness and an inability to do work, including an inability to do their daily chores. This causes a feeling of desperateness that is worsened by the perception that support systems are inadequate. Support systems are mostly identified as parents, partners and siblings to assist mainly with the physical care and financial support. Despite the fact that the family is very important to patients there is a reluctance to acknowledge their HIV status. Patients fear being rejected once it is known that they have AIDS--not only because AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease, but also because it is perceived that financial and other support will be withheld if it is known that patients have AIDS and will therefore die and not be able to return the support provided. Patients feel they have no future once a diagnosis of AIDS has been made which results in refusal of testing, as they do not see the benefit of knowing their HIV status. Assessing the coping ability of the patient within the household as part of an overall assessment is one proposed strategy that could be taken. Secondly the patient is encouraged to take a more active role in the counselling process, which could be achieved by narration. The family should be incorporated into the counselling process as early as possible.",,"adaptive behavior; adult; article; attitude to health; counseling; emotion; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Malawi; male; psychological aspect; rural population; social support; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Attitude to Health; Counseling; Emotions; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Malawi; Male; Rural Population; Social Support; MLCS; MLOWN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035436899

Thus, how can games support children to co-design their future city? Which heritage values do they represent graphically in the game environment? Geogames are games that provide a visualization of a real spatial context and in this study, Minecraft is the tool which we use to explore youth engagement. We designed two experiments, which tested Minecraft as a geogame environment for engaging young people in urban planning. These experiments were conducted with children, who emerged as active emancipated actors to bring their values to the planning practice. The playtesting results revealed the potential of Minecraft to keep children engaged in the design workshop, as well as their relevant ludic ability to co-create walkable, green, and interactive places.

There are some studies on which measures are more effective to reduce stress in Nursing assistant students. There are no studies that link SOC with the two key aspects in the prevention of stress in Nursing assistant students: the motivation of pursuing this profession and the academic level. Objectives: To explore the salutogenic paradigm among Nursing assistant students in a region of Spain (Comunitat Valenciana). Design: Cross-sectional, analytical and exploratory study carried out in 2016. Methods: Students of the first year of Nursing Assistant certification. Self-administered questionnaire to collect the variables: Sense of Coherence (SOC-13 instrument); professional vocation; Self-reported grades of the academic record. Results: The mean score for the total SOC measurement was M = 56.38 (SD = 12.236; 71). Regarding the SOC components, the average score was for Manageability M = 16.45 (SD = 4.53; 24); Comprehensibility M = 19.27 (SD = 5.642; 30)and Meaningfulness M = 20.65 (SD = 4.48; 23). Students who lived in rural environments presented a weaker SOC (M = 54.05), compared to those who were located in urban environments (M = 56.83)and large cities (M = 56.15). The students who reported a choice of studies motivated by professional vocation presented a stronger SOC, scoring also a remarkable academic performance (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Strong levels of SOC in Nursing assistant students, are related to a greater motivation to study something desirable, and to obtaining high academic performance, despite being a demanding and high-stress profession. Therefore, a strong SOC seems to contribute to being more resistant to stress. The environments that provide and facilitate greater external resources such as health, education, culture, association, leisure and recreation, for the community, have higher global levels of sense of coherence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Certified Nursing Assistant; Nursing; Salutogenic Model of Health; Sense of coherence; Vocational Education and Training","academic achievement; article; certification; city; controlled study; exploratory research; health education; human; human experiment; motivation; nursing assistant; recreation; rural area; sense of coherence; Sense of Coherence Scale; stress; student; urban area; Valencian Community; vocational education; adult; cross-sectional study; education; female; male; mental stress; occupation; psychology; questionnaire; Spain; Academic Performance; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Nursing Assistants; Occupations; Sense of Coherence; Spain; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065196725

In this article, I present a number of design actions and case studies that demonstrate how design can contribute to system change, for example via the reconnection of urban and rural ecosystems, the design of social infrastructures that enable the emergence of new enterprises, and the deployment of technology. © 2019 Tongji University and Tongji University Press","Bioregion; Civic ecology; Knowledge ecologies; Smart villages; Social infrastructure; System change; Urban-rural reconnection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063027244

In this framework, culture in its manifold expressions is considered as an embrace for the social, economic, and environmental pillars of sustainable development. There is a need to unveil the different cultural values generated from the interaction between people and their environment since these values will help cities maintain their unique identity and integrity. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to present the results of a survey method intended to assess the range of cultural values attributed by people to the historic urban landscape (HUL). Design/methodology/approach: This paper is an experimental enquiry that combines a qualitative and a quantitative approach. It is designed to distinguish the different interpretations and outlooks of people to the HUL. It integrates landscape preference studies with investigation on representative images of the city and assesses these in relation to activities, feelings, and valued aspects of landscapes. Findings: The main finding is that the most preferred scenes of the city are not the ones that best represent the city. Results exposed two sides of the HUL and related heritage values. The first is associated with the scenic beauty of the landscape and its aesthetic values, while the second is reflected in ordinary landscapes and everyday practices. Originality/value: This paper provides an insight into the different interpretations and meanings of the HUL throughout the city. It provides an empirical evidence that ordinary landscapes are of great heritage value as they surpass all aspects of human environmental interaction to contribute to the image that societies make of themselves. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural values; Heritage conservation; Historic urban landscape; Image of the city; Landscape preference; Tangible attributes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044080983

Looking at Finland, the sense that this activity is not truly political or transformative can be further enhanced by activists' own reluctance to enter into explicitly political debate and their preference for discussing futures in the neutral language of science. Connecting today's situation to precursors in the 1960s, however, we can see how these local projects are embedded in local political culture, including a Finnish tendency to play up scientific rationality as a tool for managing collective affairs.

Where Mexico City was declared the most polluted city of the world in 1992, it is now known for its very pro-active environmental politics and related initiatives. At the same time the city is gaining attention as a cultural city and hosts a growing creative class. The article shows how these two, sustainability and the cultural/creative, are interrelated in various ways. In one way the city's sustainable policies reinforced the gentrification process of the city's historic center. In another way the cultural elites respond to the city's activities in sustainability in terms of an increased interest in eco-artistic projects. In a third way the article shows how the introduction of the Western concept of sustainability is problematic in a Latin American cultural context. It runs the risk of - again - reinforcing the existing cleavage between well-educated Western oriented elites on the one hand and the mestizo masses and indigenous people on the other hand. Moreover it disregards the fact that Latin America has a fundamentally different kind of modernity and culture that can be labeled as labyrinthine, baroque or hybrid. The Western concept of sustainability most probably will not function within such a culture, a reason why the article makes a plea for the design of a concept of hybrid sustainability (or sustainabilities) that match the characteristics of the Latin American reality in general and the reality of Mexico City in particular. © 2013.","Art; Hybrid cultures; Latin America; Urban sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882587485

According to an extant synopsis, at the beginning of the film two men find themselves suddenly in a Shanghai of 1998, following an evening out in the dancehall cut short by their annoyed wives, who promptly placed them "" in the doghouse,"" in the attic. They fall into a long sleep. In the dreamscape they find themselves in a future Shanghai stranger than paradise, with flying cars and apartments where interior design is instantaneously changeable by remote control. The most shocking change is that people no longer have names but are identified by numbers. This popular science-fiction comedy from old Shanghai is not my main concern here. But the surprisingly accurate prophecy on the ubiquity of remote controls and digitalized personal identity provides a unique entry point for "" traveling"" to the present-day postsocialist Chinese city. Indeed, the universal adoption of ID numbers for Chinese citizens is recent, coinciding with the erosion of the socialist structure (in particular the strict city residence registration, or hukou, system) and of rural-urban boundaries. Hence the adoption of IDs parallels the unprecedented physical and social mobility of millions of Chinese, forming a gigantic "" floating population"" (liudong renkou). That the two men taken for dead by their families emerge intact from a futuristic construction site, along with the prescient references to digitalization and virtuality, inspire reflections on the changing nature of temporality and body in the context of frenzied urbanization in China today, especially in Shanghai - where the film unfolds in the "" present"" as well as "" future"" tenses. The film's interest in both the utopic and dystopic potential of technology and its impact on the human body is also relevant to the place of cinema in the so-called "" post-material"" and "" posthuman"" condition today.1 In the last decade of the twentieth century - the ambivalent locus of desire for the 1930s film - an art movement traversing experimental and documentary film, video art, photography, and performance has emerged with much creative energy in metropolitan centers such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. This new generation of artists place themselves right "" on the scene"" (xianchang) to record the momentous shifts in the physical and mental topography of China in the country's headlong rush toward a quasi-capitalist economy and culture. What are the distinctive features of the metropolitan imagination created by this nascent movement deploying, or rather blending, old and new media? In what manners do these image-makers, who grew up in the socialist period, engage with memories of the past and the post-revolutionary conditions while fashioning provisional designs for living the seismically shifting realities? More crucially, how do these experiments exploit the changing nature of the photographic or cinematic image for alternative social and cultural visions, as China is propelled onto the information highway and the full-speed lane of globalization? This tentative study aims to make sense of an array of still and moving images about performing (in) the city and explore ways for understanding their producers' obsessive experimentation between stasis and motion, between real and virtual time, and between the documentary and the fantastical registers of time and image. I call this performative play with both image and body, in a variety of cinematic and paracinematic forms, a "" transcinematic passage"" cutting through the postsocialist and post-cinematic landscape. © 2010 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

This interaction and indissoluble whole of the fabric, transitional space, which is described as the overlapping of indoor and outdoor spaces, has great importance. In different cultures, transitional spaces have different names: arcade, engawa, vestibule, eiwan, and hayat. It is commonly named sündürme in Cyprus. Sündürme is the essential component that determines the spatial patterns and formal configurations in the traditional architecture of Cyprus. At the same time, it is the forthcoming transition device between traditional and contemporary environments of Cyprus. Through open and renewed interpretations, sündürme has the potential to be a cultural transition that can achieve continuity of traditional values and maintain physically and socially satisfying environments. Furthermore, any planning and designing strategy that considers the potential of sündürme in new housing developments as a shared image of all communities living on the island could contribute to the sociopolitical process. Under this scope, this study points out the cultural and architectural role of sündürme and describes its spatial, functional, and climatic characteristics by referring to the formal analysis results of 154 houses. The study aims to draw attention to the importance of sündürme in the development of living environments towards achieving better living conditions and a higher quality of living environments, while maintaining the spirit of the social and cultural lifestyles of the past and possibly integrating them with the requirements of our time.

The study was undertaken in an urban district in England with data collected through in-depth individual and focus group interviews with service providers and service users. Four general practice organizations were randomly selected for study after sorting all in the district according to their record of developing involvement activities. The case studies provide evidence of how organizational values can differ markedly in general practice in relation to ideas of public involvement, with consequences for the quantity and quality of activities for involving local people and service users. The differences manifest themselves in the beliefs and attitudes of service providers about the purpose of the organization and the types of relationships that are appropriate with service users and local people. Service users appear to be very perceptive to the underlying ethos and purpose to their practice organization and this affects their responsiveness to initiatives for their involvement. The dimensions of the different values found in the study appear to be essentially the same as a number of established empirical findings of variations in values in general practice: an orientation to a narrow medical role and to general practice as a business are associated with a low valuation of involvement; an orientation to teamwork and to a broader social role appear more congruent with the development of involvement. Power is a critical issue in this setting with evidence in the study of the dominance of the medical practitioners in establishing organizational values and the nature of public involvement activities.","General practice; Organizational values; Public involvement","adolescent; adult; aged; article; attitude to health; behavior; consumer; cooperation; female; general practice; health personnel attitude; health service; health services research; human; human relation; information processing; male; middle aged; organization; organization and management; patient care; primary health care; questionnaire; United Kingdom; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Consumer Participation; Cooperative Behavior; Decision Making, Organizational; England; Family Practice; Female; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organizational Case Studies; Organizational Culture; Organizational Objectives; Patient Care Team; Power (Psychology); Primary Health Care; Professional-Patient Relations; Questionnaires; Urban Health Services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035350817

Design A qualitative study using semistructured, audio-recorded interviews conducted between December 2017 and July 2018 with caregivers and social workers. Thematic analysis using interpretative descriptive techniques performed on textual interview data within a critical realist paradigm to develop understanding of rural caregivers' lived experiences. Setting Participants were from rural areas attending a metropolitan cancer centre in Australia and social workers. Participants 21 caregivers (16 female) of people with cancer living in rural Australia within a minimum distance of 100 km from the metropolitan cancer centre where they access treatment, and five social workers employed at a metropolitan cancer service with experience of working with rural patients and caregivers. Results Thematic analysis developed two overarching themes: theme 1: caregiving in the rural setting describes the unique circumstance in which caregiving for a person with cancer takes place in the rural setting at considerable distance from the cancer service where the person receives treatment. This is explored in three categories: Rural community and culture', Life adjustments' and Available supports'. Theme 2: accessing metropolitan cancer services captures the multiplicity of tasks and challenges involved in organising and coordinating the journey to access cancer treatment in a metropolitan hospital, which is presented in the following categories: Travel', Accommodation' and Health system navigation'. Conclusions Caregivers who live in rural areas face significant challenges when confronting geographic isolation between their rural home environment and the metropolitan setting, where the patient accessed cancer treatment. There is a need for healthcare services to identify this group to develop feasible and sustainable ways to provide interventions that have the best chance of assisting rural caregivers in supporting the patient while maintaining their own health and well-being. © 2019 Author(s).","cancer; caregivers; interviews; qualitative; rural; supportive care","adult; article; Australia; cancer center; cancer therapy; caregiver; controlled study; female; home environment; human; interview; qualitative research; rural area; rural population; social worker; thematic analysis; travel; wellbeing; caregiver; health care delivery; health service; male; middle aged; neoplasm; organization and management; psychology; qualitative research; rural health care; Adult; Caregivers; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Qualitative Research; Rural Health Services; Rural Population; Urban Health Services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069475972

It describes how people have actively shaped the course, form and function of water for human settlement and the development of civilizations, establishing socio-economic structures, policies and cultures; a rich world of narratives, laws and practices; and an extensive network of infrastructure, buildings and urban form. The book is organized in five thematic sections that link practices of the past to the design of the present and visions of the future: Part I discusses drinking water management; part II addresses water use in agriculture; part III explores water management for land reclamation and defense; part IV examines river and coastal planning; and part V focuses on port cities and waterfront regeneration. Today, the many complex systems of the past are necessarily the basis for new systems that both preserve the past and manage water today: Policy makers and designers can work together to recognize and build on the traditional knowledge and skills that old structure embody. This book argues that there is a need for a common agenda and an integrated policy that addresses the preservation, transformation and adaptive reuse of historic water-related structures. Throughout, it imagines how such efforts will help us develop sustainable futures for cities, landscapes and bodies of water. © The Editor(s) and the Author(s) 2020.","Heritage Policies of Hydrological Landscapes; Historic Water-Sites; Open Access; Planning Heritage; Water Culture; Water Management and Irrigation Systems; Waterfront Regeneration",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083505362

The design and architecture of the Sufi Shrines have local as well as worldwide influences, representative spiritual, belief systems, economic, and esthetic dimensions of Muslim social institute. Therefore, Muslims’ association with the Sufi Shrines has much importance from traditional, political, social and economic perspectives.

Spatial Cultures: Towards a New Social Morphology of Cities Past and Present announces an innovative research agenda for urban studies in which themes and methods from urban history, social theory and built environment research are brought into dialogue across disciplinary and chronological boundaries. The collection confronts the recurrent epistemological impasse that arises between research focussing on the description of material built environments and that which is concerned primarily with the people who inhabit, govern and write about cities past and present. A reluctance to engage substantively with this issue has been detrimental to scholarly efforts to understand the urban built environment as a meaningful agent of human social experience. Drawing on a wide range of historical and contemporary urban case studies, as well as a selection of theoretical and methodological reflections, the contributions to this volume seek to historically, geographically and architecturally contextualize diverse spatial practices including movement, encounter, play, procession and neighbourhood. The aim is to challenge their tacit treatment as universal categories in much writing on cities and to propose alternative research possibilities with implications as much for urban design thinking as for history and the social sciences. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Sam Griffiths and Alexander von Lünen; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007032119

Public policy toward housing provision and the effects of escalating land prices in Tokyo and a few other very large cities in the country from the mid- to late 1970s onward are examined, but it is dwellings themselves and the slow but steady shift from a floor-sitting to a chair-sitting housing culture in urban and suburban parts of the country that figure most prominently in the discussion. Central to the book is the author's translation of an account written by Kyoko Sasaki, an observant wife and mother, about the housing she and her growing family experienced during the 1960s, and subsequent chapters explore some of the issues that flow from her account. Chief among these are the small size and generally poor quality of the private-sector housing that Japanese of fairly ordinary means could afford to occupy in the early postwar years, the new design initiatives undertaken at about that time by public-sector housing providers and the diffusion of at least some of their initiatives to the housing sector as a whole, and the adjustments that the occupants of housing had to, or chose to, make as the dwellings available to them as renters or as owners changed in character.

The developments so far, however, have seen humans mostly as users and consumers rather than as active contributors and designers. This paper provides a conceptual framework based on meta-design and cultures of participation that democratize design and allows all stakeholders to evolve systems to fit their needs. It establishes a new extended discourse for HCI research in which information technologies are interwoven with human lives in all aspects of our existence (at home, working, teaching, learning, and being a citizen). Specific socio-technical environments instantiating the framework in different application domains are described, including: (1) environments for people with cognitive disabilities, (2) table-top computing systems for framing and solving complex urban planning problems, (3) modeling the buildings of the world in 3D, and (4) using Smart Grids to support energy sustainability. These examples show how metadesign and cultures of participation are design approaches that allow researchers and practitioners to extend boundaries by allowing all stakeholders to have more control over their artifacts and by providing opportunities to encourage and to support contributions by many people in personally meaningful activ ities. © 2010 ACM.","Boundaries; Control; Cultures of participation; Distances; Meta-design; Motivation; Socio-technical environments; Systemic problems","Boundaries; Cultures of participation; Distances; Meta-design; Sociotechnical; Systemic problems; Cognitive systems; Design; Handicapped persons; Knowledge management; Motivation; Research; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Urban planning; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650118367

Today these associations seem to have become challenged and problematic, and often end in questioning whether public space still matters for our public life? This paper aims to bring new understanding to the reading of public life in public spaces and also contribute to rethinking of the role of urban design today within our changing public life. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts participant/observation within a case/study area, “Parque das Nações”, in Lisbon, Portugal. Findings – The paper identifies a number of spatial, social and experiential conditions that are conducive to social interactions amongst strangers. Often it is the combination of three factors that generates the most interaction. Research limitations/implications – Participant observation is a useful method to study public behaviour in the public realm. Nevertheless, as the study was conducted in one location, the findings may not be transferable to other locations/cultures, etc. Practical implications – This paper demonstrates the need to rethink and adapt urban design practices to an increasing changing public life. Urban design needs to be much more sensitive to all locations (planned and unplanned) and the favourable spatial, experiential and social conditions people make use of and which can provoke positive interactions need to be recognised. Social implications A better understanding of the factors that are conducive to positive interaction between strangers and non/strangers in the public realm will help to develop more favourable conditions for these to take place. The interaction between people is part of the fabric of social life.

Methods: A questionnaire survey undertaken in three different locations (urban, rural, and mixed), including 1100 participants, and implementing both a cross-validational and a bootstrap multivariate design. Outcome measures were intention to use a condom at next sex and condom salience (i.e., confidence in the protective value of condoms). Culturally grounded predictors included traditional beliefs about illness, beliefs in ancestral protection, endorsement of AIDS myths, and mortality salience (CONTACT). Results: Participants exhibited strong endorsement of indigenous beliefs about illness and ancestral protection, and moderate endorsement of AIDS myths. Participants who viewed condoms as important for HIV prevention were more likely to show strong endorsement of both beliefs in ancestral protection and traditional beliefs about illness. Participants who strongly endorsed AIDS myths viewed condoms as less important and also had lower intention to use scores. Finally, participants who knew HIV positive people, and/or people who had died of HIV-related illnesses, had higher condom salience and higher intention to use scores. Conclusions: Results challenge the assumption that culturally grounded variables are inherently adversarial in their relationship to biomedical models of HIV prevention, and offer insights into how traditional beliefs and cultural constructions of HIV/AIDS might be used more effectively in HIV education programs.

A model is proposed, which treats learning as a diffusion process in a dynamic way, so that key strategies and their effects are investigated over time. Specifically, the question being examined is how learning and information technology strategies can change the mindset of people to be more physically active in their mobility around a city. This is carried out by developing a system dynamics (SD) computer simulation model, where learning strategies that promote walking can be tested prior to implementation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the specific key stages of knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation, the proposed SD model incorporates individual citizen and group level learning and diffusion processes in a unified integrated approach. The SD model gives a clear picture on how learning and changing mindsets occur in the context of a city, whereby we can explore the main drivers to learn new sustainability related habits. A case study is used to contextualize and demostrate the active mobility issue, in order to develop practical scenarios for promoting a walking mindset. This is done in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model and show its practicality. Through the model we investigate the relationships among variables such as awareness, contact, communication and adoption and evaluate their impact on city policies to promote a walking mindset. Findings: The developed SD model exhibits important dimensions, such as social learning, motivation to change behaviour and an analysis of the effects of plausible strategies for promoting sustainable active mobility. The authors have proven that through simulation experimentation, we can significantly accelerate the shaping and diffusion of a walking mindset, by influencing individual and community learning via the introduction of Information and Communication Technology in conjunction with an awareness campaign strategy. Research limitations/implications: The diagrammatic representation and the quantification of the factors that contribute to active mobility give rise to better understanding of how policy makers could promote a walking culture in a city. The implications are that the proposed SD model could be used by city planning authorities as a framework for shaping mindsets towards active and sustainable mobility. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the further understanding of learning, diffusion of new ideas and strategic planning within the city context. Through the proposed SD model, a number of strategies are formulated and tested using scenario planning, sensitivity analysis and optimization, in order to develop a walking mindset and an urban culture of sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active mobility; Diffusion theory; Learning capability; Organizational learning; System dynamics; Urban development","computer simulation; conceptual framework; information technology; integrated approach; learning; mobility; numerical model; sustainability; urban development; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075427554

Methods: Data from World Health Survey conducted in 2002-2004 in low-middle- and high-income countries were used. Participants aged 18 years and over were selected using multistage, stratified cluster sampling. BMI was used as an outcome variable. Culture of the countries was measured using Hofstede's cultural dimensions: Uncertainty avoidance, individualism, Power Distance and masculinity. The potential determinants of individual-level BMI were participants' sex, age, marital status, education, occupation as well as household-wealth and location (rural/urban) at the individual-level. The country-level factors used were average national income (GNI-PPP), income inequality (Gini-index) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. A two-level random-intercepts and fixed-slopes model structure with individuals nested within countries were fitted, treating BMI as a continuous outcome variable. Results: A sample of 156,192 people from 53 countries was included in this analysis. The design-based (weighted) mean BMI (SE) in these 53 countries was 23.95(0.08). Uncertainty avoidance (UAI) and individualism (IDV) were significantly associated with BMI, showing that people in more individualistic or high uncertainty avoidance countries had higher BMI than collectivist or low uncertainty avoidance ones. This model explained that one unit increase in UAI or IDV was associated with 0.03 unit increase in BMI. Power distance and masculinity were not associated with BMI of the people. National level Income was also significantly associated with individual-level BMI. Conclusion: National culture has a substantial association with BMI of the individuals in the country. This association is important for understanding the pattern of obesity or overweight across different cultures and countries. It is also important to recognise the importance of the association of culture and BMI in developing public health interventions to reduce obesity or overweight. © 2019 The Author(s).","BMI; Culture; Obesity","adult; body mass; cultural factor; female; global health; human; male; middle aged; multilevel analysis; obesity; Adult; Body Mass Index; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Female; Global Health; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multilevel Analysis; Obesity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071760948

It is a reflection of people's traditions, culture, aspirations, needs, and their future. In the past, the local community with its beliefs and creative abilities was an integral part of the design and building process. As a result, the architectural product has succeeded in expressing the identity of this community and maintaining elements of continuity and distinction. There is a lot of typical historic Islamic cities, recently its urbanization has been advanced with the demolition of townscape and historic monuments under the modern European style urban planning Today, most design and construction processes are based on imported trends, and the product is foreign and does not express community values, and local urban spaces have lost their identity. This contradiction represents the key issue of the identity crisis in the contemporary Arab city.Arab architecture is suffering from the absence of values and principles derived from the architectural heritage, ignorance of local climate and materials, in addition to the lack of integrating modern technology with local values. Tradition must be respected but development is the key of our existence. Development and tradition could move in parallel. Architectural styles and techniques could also be developed with respect to their original ideals. New road construction has demolished many traditional houses in old town. This paper describes these phenomena in oriental and west world and we based on case study transformation of the city of Bechar during the last 50 years, indicating in particular how the city has moved from an introversion sustainable city (the vernacular tissue or the old ksar) to the ex-colonial and rather provincial city into a urbanisation that is open to and influenced by the financial flows of international capitalism and that is seeking further integration into the world economy. This research targets a deeper understanding of the urban structure and heritage, studying the different causes of tradition remodelling in local urban spaces and find out a way that understanding traditional design principles and sustainability materials, our object is to motivate the architects to conserving the local identity, to find an approach that blends between traditions and modernity to revive the urban sustainable vernacular city. © 2019 The Authors.

The research focuses on the renewal of the large prefabricated housing estates, dominant type of urban housing in the area where after the privatisation process resident-owners own only a so-called floating plot under their block. In total, 80 per cent of the land of the whole neighbourhood remains public. The question is how participatory place-making works in this specific urban, social and cultural situation? Design/methodology/approach: By introducing the topic from a theoretical point of view, the study is based on research conducted in Budapest’s Újpalota Housing Estate. Fieldwork, project analysis and interviews uncover the complexity of this Hungarian case where appropriation of residents, municipality and European social regeneration projects are simultaneously present with different types of participatory methods. Findings: The majority of real changes in Újpalota – as well as in housing estates of post-Communist countries in general – are led by individual or common appropriation that sometimes becomes convincing participation. This informal transformation of the built or natural environment can create a small sense of place everywhere. At the same time, it can work against the architectural and urban character of a neighbourhood or a building, rendering a feeling of disorder. Originality/value: The paper based on this Hungarian case shows that the real culture of participatory place-making is still missing in post-Communist context, and despite some good examples, the majority of people are inactive, waiting for changes to be made by leaders. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Appropriation; Budapest; Large prefabricated housing estate; Participation; Shrinking city; Urban renewal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046136020

Climate studies worldwide indicate that our rapidly changing environmental conditions are expected to alter precipitation quantity, intensity, frequency and duration as well as decrease water runoff and groundwater and increase water temperatures, which will subsequently increase the risk of waterborne pathogens in drinking water reservoirs (de Loë and Plummer, 2010; Harper et al., 2011). Drinking water quality and contamination of water - from source to tap - with pathogens (e.g. bacteria), agricultural pesticides, sewage and waste effluent and algal growth and production as a result of climatic changes are also raising national and international concern (Delpla et al., 2009). Canada is not exempt from these irregularities or concerns; adverse changes in Canada’s water resources, including oceans, streams, wetlands and rivers and their impacts on the human and natural landscapes are evident and unsettling (Lemmen et al., 2008; Egginton et al., 2011). While climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies are imperative, Canada is experiencing considerable challenges in terms of the identification of such strategies and their operationalization, especially among pockets of the population who are already particularly vulnerable through, for example, poverty, unemployment, loss of traditional cultures, substandard education systems and inadequate health care. This vulnerability includes many Indigenous (First Nations, Inuit and Metis)1 peoples in Canada given that they have been subjected to colonial and racist policies and practices for generations, which have resulted in living conditions akin to those in developing countries (Ford et al., 2010). Broken promises associated with historic Treaties and land/water rights, loss of control over natural resources, poverty, unemployment, loss of traditional languages and culture as a result of the abuses at residential schools,2 substandard education systems and inadequate health care are only some of the injustices that Indigenous peoples in Canada face today (Miller, 1991; Fournier and Crey, 1997; Castleden, 2007). With respect to Indigenous peoples’ distinct relationship to the land and waters found within their traditional territories, ‘whether by conscious design or institutional neglect,… [they] face some of the worst environmental devastation in the nation’ (Mascarenhas, 2007, p. 570, citing Robert Bullard, an internationally recognized expert in environmental racism). As a result of this colonized reality, many Indigenous communities in Canada are especially vulnerable to (and often have limited financial and resource capacity to) not only absorbing the shocks from rapidly changing anthropogenic environmental conditions but also to effectively manage their water and other natural resources as a result of said changes (Bergkamp et al., 2003; Furgal and Seguin, 2006; Harper et al., 2012). Indigenous peoples, especially those living in rural, remote, coastal and northern parts of Canada (roughly 50 per cent of the Indigenous population) (Figure 11.1), are experiencing the greatest impacts of and are more susceptible to the negative impacts of climate change than their non-Indigenous counterparts (Ford et al., 2010; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2012). This is generally attributed to the fact that they are more often natural resource-dependent and more closely connected to the land and water than non-Indigenous peoples who are now overwhelmingly (80 per cent) located in urban areas. At the same time, according to the 2011 National Household Survey, approximately 1.4 million people in Canada (4.3 per cent of the Canadian population) identify as Indigenous (Statistics Canada, 2013); this figure is approximately 20 per cent more than what was tracked in the 2006 census, making Indigenous peoples in Canada the fastest growing and youngest in the country - a stark contrast to the national population, which is ageing and urbanizing. The lived experiences of many Indigenous peoples, subjected to decades of gross environmental and social injustices and health inequities - and now emerging climatic pressures - warrants national and international attention and viable action; but any actions taken must be on their terms. This chapter offers an overview of the history of colonization in Canada, including Indigenous Title to land, Indigenous Rights (specifically water rights) and Treaties in order to illustrate the complexity of Indigenous-settler relations as just one of the many barriers facing Indigenous peoples with respect to adaptive capacity in a changing climate. Collaborative and selfgovernment in Canada is also touched on with respect to managing water resources in the context of climate change. To illustrate this, we profile a case study demonstrating the potential of Indigenous grassroots initiatives, such as community-based water resource management, as a high impact strategy for increasing adaptive capacity regarding climate change effects; such community-based approaches seek to ensure a healthy environment, social equity and viable livelihoods (Armitage, 2005). The chapter concludes with a call for more collaboration among such water resource monitoring and management organizations in an effort to mobilize local, regional and national agendas focused on water rights and equity in the context of our rapidly changing climate. © 2015 Dominic Stucker and Elena Lopez-Gunn.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928993297

These spaces speak to the culture of a place as much as to the quality of its design, but the implementation of design as an inclusive process is fraught with difficulty. This is particularly pertinent in discussions about better ways of engaging people with urban design, where there is often a language barrier between those who specialise in spatial manipulation and the broader 'society' that uses this space. This paper gives an empirical account of how a spatial consciousness can be translated to society through an international design competition. The competition method of urban design relies upon promotion and 'eventfulness', both of which interpolate the public and contribute towards the generation of a deeper interest in the spatial imaginary of city planning. The creation of 'urban design consumers' through the visual consumption of the designs themselves offers an alternative way to gain public interest to the established traditions of public notices and formal public meetings. In this case, the competition extended the activity of urban designers beyond the mechanics of 'space production' to include 'consumer production' where a more intimate relationship between city planning and the people began to emerge.","Competition; Consumerism; Public spaces; Urban design","consumption behavior; public space; urban design; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881036665

In addition, tourists increasingly devise their holidays with the aim of learning, self-development and making contact with the local population. Due to the postmodern commodi?cation of culture, visitors’ experiences with cultural heritage require innovation and adaptation in order to order them unique and meaningful personal events rather than the former passive activities. All around the world, numerous museums, heritage sites and cultural venues are now working in this direction, introducing new visitor models. Memorable visiting experiences can be designed in museums and at heritage sites, not only for the segments of traditional demand but also for new ones which, in general, include younger guests. It is a way to transform cultural heritage into an ‘experiencescape’ (O’Dell and Billing 2005) - a place of enjoyment, socialisation, pleasure, emotions and amusement, offering visitors different kinds of valuable tourism, educational, cultural and entertainment experiences. In post-modern society, consumers, who are continuously in search of emotions and subjective and personalised consumption, do not demand goods and services, but memorable, unique, holistic and engaging experiences with a high symbolic content (Holbrook and Hirschman 1982; Addis and Holbrook 2001). The customer is not only buying a good, but also services and information, experiences and culture (Rifkin 2000), and wishes to have an active role during their consumption (Prentice 2001). This means that ffrms must be increasingly dedicated to trying to order experience-based products, which can engage the customer emotionally, physically, mentally, socially and/or spiritually (O’Sullivan and Spangler 1998; Pine and Gilmore 1999; Fabris 2003: 203; Argano and Dalla Sega 2009). Therefore, there is now much more emphasis than in the past on sounds and music, scentsand fragrances, atmospheres, colours and images, tastes and interactivity to enrich goods and services. For example, it is common practice to use music in locations to make the visit more pleasant and more memorable (Krishna 2010: 149). Colours, fragrances and lights can have a similar impact. Sometimes the deprivation of one sense is used to exalt others. This is the case of Dialogo al Buio, an exhibition held using routes to be followed in complete darkness, accompanied by expert non-sighted guides, to experience new and unexpected emotions that amplify the perceptions of touch, smell and taste. Pine and Gilmore (1999) have identified four different experience spheres on the basis of two parameters, the (active or passive) involvement of the guest and the type of relationship between the customer and the experience (which involves absorption, in other words physical or virtual involvement, and immersion, in other words mental involvement). These four spheres, which are called entertainment, education, escapism and the aesthetic experience, are not opposed to one another, but on the contrary are often mixed and lead to global, subjective, unique and tailored experiences. The best experiences are, in any case, those in which the visitor, by taking an active part, is completely immersed in the situation that they are experiencing. This requires the involvement of the five senses or the order of something memorable (Smith 2009: 188). Generally, providers tend to order a mixture of experiences that are judged more complete if enhanced by all four components. An example of this is Emozioni da Museo, an initiative at Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, which is described in the case study in this chapter (Box 48.1). Therefore, experiences that mix entertainment and education (‘edutainment’), shopping (‘shoppertainment’), or eating (‘eatertainment’) are increasingly common. Tourism agencies, private and public bodies and destinations are also making an effort to offer events, packaging and atmosphere, involving physical settings, extravaganzas (Ritzer 1999), sensory designs and other differentiating elements, which allow tourists to enjoy meaningful experiences and create positive attitudes in them. Continuous ‘re-enchantment’ processes (Baudrillard 1993; Bauman 1993: 33) aim to make the ‘cathedrals of consumption’ even more magical, fascinating or fantastic. These are places where processes related to the purchase, supply, consumption and/or use of goods and services are undertaken, and are often important tourist attractions, destinations or infrastructure, such as retail centres, theme parks, museums and archaeological sites, etc. (Ritzer 2005: 68). Frequently they become multipurpose containers which simultaneously satisfy different needs (entertainment, socialising, shopping, education, eating, etc.). For example, museums often have an increasing range of support and auxiliary services that offer highly engaging experiences, which are sometimes unique and unforgettable, thanks to themed settings, events, atmospheres, tactile sensations, colours and images, sounds, fragrances, virtual realities, multi-sensory stimuli, theatre pieces, workshops and operators performing as actors in the setting. In some cases the ‘cathedrals of consumption’ are symbols of Western culture that have been exported and sold in other countries, as has been happening for some years with museums and art galleries, which are reproduced in multiple locations (such as the Guggenheim Museum which is now present, besides New York, in Bilbao, Berlin, Las Vegas, Venice and Abu Dhabi). All this entails risks of mass reproduction of culture and art and the search for perfect imitation - in other words, the ‘McDisneyisation’ of culture, which is feared by experts in the sector, who are afraid that museums and cultural heritage are becoming the new theme parks (Swarbrooke 2000). Nowadays, the field of museums and cultural heritage is greatly affected by shifts in demand and supply. In particular, there is increased competition to access ever-shrinking funds. Moreover, there has been an increase in consumers’ attention towards the quality of their leisure enjoyment. Furthermore, museums and heritage sites are frequently considered as institutions that can trigger virtuous processes of urban renewal. All this has fostered the development of cultural consumption, but, at the same time, has increased visitors’ expectations and needs. In fact, consumers today are not only interested in satisfying their need for learning, but also wish to have more engaging types of experiences. In particular, there appears to be a strong demand for experiences providing inner growth and self-development in social, cultural, intellectual and emotional terms (Doering 1999). Thus, the role of these institutions is changing, also due to the commodification of culture and to the merging of high and low culture in the post-modern era. They are trying to increase visitor attendance also by attracting new segments (especially families and young people). It can be claimed that for all these reasons, heritage venues and cultural sites now ought to modify their image and their offer to become more market-oriented and to create more engaging visits. In fact, cultural heritage and ‘museums are essentially experiential products’ (Prentice 1996), and smells, colours, sounds, animations and interactions are potentially part of this product (Prentice 2001). Currently, significant efforts in this sense have been made above all by science museums, in which ‘edutainment’ and the need to make the visit engaging and fun, as well as instructive, for the youngest visitors and for school groups as well, has already seen a significant effort in this direction for a number of years. The role of cultural heritage today is broader, and safeguarding it requires growth in demand and adequate management to enable the public to perceive its value and the need to protect it. There are numerous tools now available to management to achieve the above aims, by guaranteeing visitors not only learning experiences, but also entertainment, excitement and time for contemplation (Kotler and Kotler 1999: 187). In this regard, it is interesting to note that in recent years a growing number of experts have been addressing the issue of multi-sensoriality in tourism, which in the past was overlooked in favour of the sole sense of sight. In particular, the latest edition of the book The Tourist Gaze (Urry 2002: 146), which previously concentrated on the use of sight, now also talks about other types of panoramas and perceptions beyond visual landscapes, such as ‘soundscapes’, ‘smellscapes’, ‘tastescapes’ and ‘geographies of touch’. Examples are olfactory-based routes, touch and sound stimuli, and multimedia installations. Thus the importance of ‘sensescapes’ (Quan and Wang 2004) is growing, being the settings that stimulate visitors’ senses and manage to offer sensations other than the routine and everyday environment (Urry 2002: 155). Moreover, the supply system should be flexible and encourage some discretion in the use of the setting by various customers, in order to be able to allow them to undergo unique personal experiences, based on their own use of the ‘servicescape’ (Bitner 1992). In addition, in order to enhance the experiences offered, often complementary or auxiliary components are added to the core product, such as restaurants, bars, shops, e-commerce, meeting areas, guided tours, conferences, concerts, programmes for teachers, workshops, etc. The new technologies enable traditional services to be accompanied by innovative services, thanks to interactive multimedia resources, multi-sensory techniques and IT support; examples are audio guides with palm-tops, also for children, multimedia kiosks, digital archives of art works, virtual and audio-visual visits, and three-dimensional reconstructions of monuments (Falk and Dierking 1992; Bourgeon-Renault et al. 2006). Given this background, locations use new means, other than information boards and traditional guided visits, to present the objects displayed in relation to other objects and to the visitor, for example through the reconstruction of an environment to mirror the original context of a work or historic moment or through particularly striking displays. One example is the Statue Room of the Egyptian Museum in Turin, in which the lighting and soundscape have been designed by Dante Ferretti, a famous set designer, to recreate the atmosphere of the inside of the pyramids and make the works displayed even more powerful and striking, thus emotionally involving the visitor (Xanthoudaki 2003). In some locations it is possible to relive past eras thanks to historic re-enactments in period costume and reconstructions of environments and lifestyles of far-off places and times. An excellent example is the Butser Ancient Farm, in England, a real open-air workshop in which it is possible to experience aspects of everyday prehistoric life by tasting the meals of the age and taking part in celebrations, such as that for the start of the summer, building a hut using ancient techniques, etc. Other innovations concern the introduction of new communication methods that guide and accompany the visit, such as animation or the use of actors who tell stories associated with the collection or the locations (Jackson et al. 2002), the offer of workshops where visitors can fashion objects using ancient techniques or can experience new sensations (for example, a short walk in a gravity-free environment), and the use of games to involve the youngest visitors who, while visiting an archaeological museum, as happens in Milan, can play the games that their ancestors used to play. Finally, it is now common for cultural sites to use storytelling (Kotler 2003), thanks to new, professional roles (for example, actors, set designers, costume designers), or people normally responsible for back-office work (for example restorers), who increasingly work in the public gaze. All the tools set out so far can increase the value of the experience, by enhancing its ‘theatrical’ aspect and ensuring that the place visited becomes a setting that offers a show (Falk and Dierking 1992; Bourgeon-Renault et al. 2006). They are transforming the enjoyment of culture by increasingly involving visitors, who are becoming the co-creators of their own experience. The aim is to shift the visitor’s attention to playful elements, entertainment, emotional pull, thus stimulating their creativity, imagination, emotions and not only the traditional conflicting sentiments that are felt before an artwork: emotion or boredom, curiosity or lack of involvement (Zorzi 2004). In designing the routes to enjoy the cultural resources of a location, it is therefore necessary always to take account of the fact that visitors are the co-designers and co-producers of their own experiences (Simonsen et al. 2010: 187). Therefore, they see and assess attractions, places and cultural events through their own personal way of interpreting them, linked to social, cultural and personal values that are highly varied. The expectations can also change markedly depending on whether the tourist is looking for the authentic or just an experience (Smith 2009: 189). In conclusion, cultural heritage should be considered as places of interpretation, in which percep-tions are sharply influenced for each consumer by imaginary and real representations of the past provided by the social, material and cultural environment of the place being visited and by the social, temporal and spatial dimensions (Sundbo and Darmer 2008: 181; Simonsen et al. 2010: 187). In designing an experience and in assessing it, it is necessary to take account of these dimensions, of space-time links, and of imaginary worlds and personal fights of fancy. © 2013 Melanie Smith and Greg Richards.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063544088

Based on years of research,we know that murals, altars, choirs,music bands, ethnic dance troupes, embroidery and quilting groups, drumming circles, theater troupes, parades, and festivals are all examples of what people describe as cultural assets in communities around the United States.These are artistic and creative outlets that are a crucial aspect of quality of life.They are valued for the intrinsic properties of art and contribute to the community's well-being. They are found in a variety of places, including formal cultural presentation venues such as museums and theaters, small and midsize organizations where artists gather to make art and produce events, and in community cultural centers. But they also occur with great frequency, formally and informally, in places and through organizations that are not primarily concerned with the arts, such as schools, churches, parks, community centers, social service organizations, social clubs and benevolent societies, and sometimes businesses and commercial retail establishments. Moreover, arts and non-arts entities often have to work together to make cultural participation possible (Jackson and Herranz 2002). Although arts and cultural participation at the community level are at the heart of community life, many policy makers, urban planners, and arts administrators have not acknowledged the arts as an essential part of a community's core, to the detriment of communities. The range of opportunities for cultural participation needed for a healthy community eludes many of these players. Instead, large cultural institutions concerned primarily with presenting formal professional arts, often with ties to the nonprofit and public sectors, have dominated with their ideas of what constitutes the arts world and the cultural sector. Activity at all artistic skill levels, often in smaller arts and cultural organizations as well as through other public, private, and commercial arts outlets, exists at the periphery of recognition, even though in reality it is at the center of real life in communities. In the arts administration and cultural policy field, informal arts practices were formally recognized as an important aspect of the cultural sector during an American Assembly meeting in 1997 focused on the arts and their public purpose.2 During that meeting, the importance of ethnographic research that could capture informal, amateur, community-based, and unincorporated arts, in addition to quantitative or statistical research on other aspects of the sector, was emphasized. Since that time, research on this kind of informal or unincorporated activity has continued, although work is still needed to position this aspect of the cultural sector in a way that does justice to the significance of its role in society. This chapter sets out to challenge the dominant model that relegates community arts and culture to the sidelines; it offers an alternative set of values that has implications for how arts administrators, urban planners, and policy makers should pursue their work in planning, urban design, funding, and cultural programming. With better research about communities and charged with defining and engaging with the creative economy3 and the ideology of the creative city,4 they have an opportunity to reassess their assumptions and approaches. The material presented here is based on years of research completed by the Urban Institute on the arts and artists in community life.5 Research has included participant observation of arts-related activities and events in neighborhoods all over the United States as well as hundreds of interviews and scores of focus group discussions with artists, arts administrators, urban planners, community development professionals, policy makers, and community residents. It has also included general population surveys on cultural participation and attitudes toward artists. © 2008 by Rutgers University Press.

Design/methodology/approach The paper used anecdotal data and popular press coverage to trace the evolution of the hip-hop music industry in the USA and discuss aspects of the marketing strategies of key players in the industry. Additionally, the strategic response of dominant firms to their success within the industry is explored. Findings Hip-hop music and its ensuing culture is now a well-established industry that has enormous marketing power. Although few championed their efforts in the beginning, the contributions of Black American entrepreneurs to the music industry is becoming increasingly recognized by existing firms within the industry and beyond. The failure of major record companies to capitalize on the hip-hop phenomenon resulted in the creation of new ventures and a new industry. While one could argue that very few key Black American entrepreneurs remain in the industry, the impact and influence of these entrepreneurs and those that have been recruited by major labels suggests that the hip-hop entrepreneurs should not be ignored. Originality/value This paper sheds light on the development of the hip-hop music industry, which could be of value to aspiring Black American entrepreneurs and marketing managers of companies in other industries that target young urban customers as well as companies that are interested in forming partnerships with Black American entrepreneurs. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Black people; Entrepreneurialism; Marketing strategy; Music industry; Unites States of America",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955136905

Its premise is that there are vestiges of tradition which remain part of the urban fabric in most southern Nigerian towns. It is thought that these traditions can, and should, be developed further to ensure that there is a positive integration of the old with the new, in the physical form, aesthetics and theoretical interpretation of urban design. Also as a development model, this integration approach has considerable relevance to other aspects of Nigerian urban life where there is the need for the accommodation of various cultures and social backgrounds. Relevant material, including documented data, will be used to discuss the premises and theories put forward. Central to the main theme is the argument for a re-ordering of architectural design and urban planning in southern Nigeria to better accommodate the more traditional or cultural features of life as the illustrations shown will highlight. The paper focuses specifically on the Igbo-speaking area of South-eastern Nigeria. The development of its housing fabric has varied distinctly from that of Northern and South-western Nigeria, which both have the effects of Islamic influence and, in the latter region, Brazilian and European influence, on local culture to be considered. Both these regions have had more urbanised and cosmopolitan cultural indigenous development patterns than the south-east. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with these Nigerian regions and other developing areas. It would seem that 'Igboland' escaped these influences mainly due to its geographical location in the hinterland of South-eastern Nigeria. Islam did not penetrate as far down from North-eastern Nigeria to the south-east as it had done from North-western Nigeria to the south-west. This was partly due to the more tropical humid terrain which was detrimental to horses and mounted warfare and the way in which religious wars or Jihads were traditionally fought. Also, the acephalous societal organisation of the Igbos, when contrasted with the more hierarchical Northern Hausa and Western Yoruba societies, were less predisposed to convert voluntarily from native individualised worship to a more structured heirarchic monotheistic religion. Being away from the Atlantic coast of Nigeria meant that European influence took longer to affect hinterland Igbo lifestyles. It also meant that the area had few settlements of repatriated and freed African slaves who had made their way back to Nigeria from America and Brazil. Called Saros and Agudas respectively, these returnees brought with them new cultural styles and established residential settlements which were influential in the development of coastal towns such as Lagos and Calabar. Similarly, missionary and government enterprise reached the Igbo hinterland much later than the coast, thus Christianity and its cultural influence was felt much later in this area. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with other Nigerian regions and other developing countries.",,"architectural design; architectural heritage; building design; developing country; housing development; Igbo people; urban planning; Nigeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030446191

A number of these people now live in the downtown areas of large cities in close association with the established vagrant culture which includes a significant portion of alcohol abusers. The bizarre and impoverished nature of the lives of these formerly institutionalized mentally ill citizens, coupled with their propinquity to government and business establishments, creates a social policy dilemma. A point prevalence study design was used to ascertain the demographic, physical, mental illness and alcohol abuse characteristics of a sample of a vagrant population which inhabits the downtown area of an American Northwest urban community. Analysis of the data of a sample of vagrants who frequent an emergency shelter and a single residence occupancy hotel demonstrated that the two groups were similar. Participants were predominantly male, white and in their mid thirties. Forty percent had never married and over 50% were high school educated and possess labor skills. Grouped data indicates that, in view of the dearth of literature describing the relationship of mentally illness and alcohol abuse, the psychiatric and alcohol use behavior of deinstitutionalized population requires further study. © 1985.",,"alcoholism; central nervous system; deinstitutionalization; demography; epidemiology; geographic distribution; human; mental disease; policy; psychological aspect; social aspect; social status; Adult; Aged; Alcoholism; Cross-Sectional Studies; Deinstitutionalization; Disabled Persons; Female; Human; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Age; Poverty; Social Environment; Transients and Migrants; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022415956

However, migration of young people from rural to urban areas, and a lack of farm successors negatively impact on the continuity of family farming. The pattern of migration is unbalanced in terms of gender: women are more likely to leave rural areas than men, which has negative consequences for rural development. The objective of this study was to identify rural women's viewpoint about the elements that would facilitate them to eventually take over the family farm. Q-methodology was used to identify rural women's viewpoints. Data were collected individually from 28 women, face-to-face with each woman, using a transportable board game to enable friendlier dynamics. Our findings showed five women's viewpoints: rural attractiveness, family support, recognition, working and living conditions, and financial autonomy. The identification of these different viewpoints could provide insights that can be used to design public and private interventions aimed to favor female heirs to take over the family farm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Culture; Farm transfer; Gender; Rural migration","agriculture; cultural relations; family farm; gender relations; migration; perception; rural society; womens status",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078182995

It considers the culture and discourses of power in the school and the ethical implications of telling the author’s story. Utilizing autoethnography as a method of inquiry, it draws on a critical incident to explore the incompatibility of the author’s private and professional identities, and reflect on the impact of homophobic and heteronormative discursive practices in the workplace, on health, well-being and identity. Design/methodology/approach: This research is grounded in an interpretivist philosophy. It utilizes writing about the self as a method of inquiry. Findings: This research examines the incompatibility of the author’s private and professional identities and offers insight into the steps that those in positions of power will take to protect and perpetuate the heteronormative discourse of rural life. Research limitations/implications: This research presents the perspective of only one lesbian teacher in a rural context. Consequently, generalizations are inappropriate and recommendations are difficult. Whilst the absence of clear ethical regulation presents an infinite number of possibilities for autoethnographers, the silence that surrounds the prescription of the ethics of autoethnography leaves those of us at the beginnings of our research careers without clear guidance. Originality/value: This research specifically addresses a dearth of research examining the experiences of the rural lesbian (or gay) teacher in the UK. Headteachers of rural schools must ensure that their schools are inclusive and welcoming environments for teachers, and their equalities policies are living documents that are not simply cast aside in the face of rural parent power.

In this article, we analyze local factors that are significant for urban planning to include in an integration plan through case studies in three cities in Germany. We have chosen to study Germany because of the country’s touted Willkommen Kultur (welcome culture), which was prompted in large part by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s “Flüchtlinge Willkommen” (“refugees welcome”) stance. Now, three years after Chancellor Merkel’s declaration to the world, although international and national policies set many parameters for refugee integration, responses to the uncertainty of the situation are fundamentally informed by local contexts. Germany has adopted a policy of distributing refugees to communities throughout the country according to the so-called “Königstein Key”, which sets quotas for each state according to economic capacity. We have selected case study cities and a county that are at different scales and regions: Borken in Hessen (13,500 people), Kassel County (200,000), and Essen, a larger city (600,000). Here we investigate the ways in which German citizens and refugees interact and integrate, with a focus on the social-spatial aspects of refugee experiences and the impacts on urban planning policy, urban morphology, building typology, and pattern language formation. Beyond crisis, we are looking at how refugees can and will try to integrate into their host countries, cities, and neighborhoods and start a new life and how host communities respond to refugee arrival. Urban architecture projects for housing and work opportunities that help the process of integration are part of this study. Particularly, in this article, we investigate the reality on the ground of the positive Willkommen Kultur and the high expectations and implied promises that were set in 2015 by Chancellor Angela Merkel and German society. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Building projects; Pattern language; Refugee acclimatization; Urban design; Urban transformation; Welcome city; Welcome culture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059327001

Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO2eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architecture; Boats; Building materials; Buildings; Construction industry; Employment; Forestry; Lakes; Offshore structures; Product design; Project management; Sea level; Tall buildings; Urban planning; Water levels; Wood; Wooden construction; Construction sectors; Constructive technique; Environmental benefits; Non-timber forest products; Schoenoplectus californicus; Traditional constructions; Traditional techniques; Wood-based materials; Construction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033775167

In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement.

The study seeks to gain a national understanding of older people's homelessness and to inform prevention strategies by drawing on interventions undertaken in a range of geographically and socially diverse locations across Australia. The research is partnered with Assistance with Care and Housing for the Aged (ACHA) agencies throughout Australia. This program, currently funded through the federal Department of Social Services (previously funded by the Department of Health and Ageing) and operating through community and government agencies, is purposively designed to assist disadvantaged older people who are at risk of homelessness or are homeless. It aims to facilitate their ongoing independence within the community by facilitating access to appropriate and affordable housing and by linking older people where appropriate to community care and support services. This practice model corresponds strongly to contemporary homelessness prevention practice. The paradigm of housing alongside appropriate supports underpins the ACHA program and thus provides not only a specialised focus on vulnerable older people but also a link with contemporary homelessness initiatives. There has been longstanding criticism of a lack of attention to older people's homelessness. However, in Australia there has been increasing recognition of this distinctive form of social exclusion. Leading on from recommendations in the Australian Government's 'White Paper' on homelessness (FaHCSIA 2008), legislative changes to the Aged Care Act 1997 identify older people experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless (Part 2.2, Section 11-3) as a special needs group that receive priority access to residential aged care. In addition, there has been funding of specialised aged care facilities that provide care for formerly homeless people who have complex health needs. Of particular importance is the acknowledgement of homelessness in the aged care reform package, Living longer. Living better. (DoHA 2012), which has resulted in increased funding for outreach services to older people in housing crisis in rural areas. This initiative signals a clear recognition that housing is an aged care issue. Historically, with the exception of the small ACHA program, Australia's housing and ageing portfolios have operated separately. There have been consistent calls by gerontologists that housing and ageing policy need to be coupled. The homelessness policy attention has largely focused on older people who live with a range of complex care needs linked to their homeless history where independent housing is not seen as appropriate. There is also a clear need to consider older people experiencing homelessness for the first time in their later years in the policy arena. Notwithstanding the significant and growing numbers of older people experiencing either first time homelessness or housing crises in later life, there is little empirical evidence about the nature of the problem in Australia and the drivers of first time homelessness among older people nationally. In the absence of a national evidence base there are limitations in the capacity to achieve homelessness prevention objectives for this group. Research aims: This study aims to contribute to the evidence base about homelessness prevention for older people experiencing homelessness or housing crises in later life. Building on the existing evidence drawn primarily from Australia's two largest capital cities, Sydney and Melbourne, this study examines older people's homelessness and preventive strategies in geographically, culturally and economically diverse areas of Australia. It draws on new empirical material gathered in five Australian states and across 31 agencies working with older people in housing need. Specifically, the study undertook to: → Review Australia's knowledge of older people's homelessness in the context of international literature. Consideration of the research literature in Australia and other western countries provides an understanding not only of the living circumstances of vulnerable older people but also the distinctive characteristics of homelessness as it is experienced by older people. In particular, the pattern of long-term and first time homelessness is highlighted as a theme in the literature. → Consider insights from gerontology. In particular, the frameworks of life course theory-our rich knowledge of the role of home and place and their integral nature to older people's wellbeing, and agency or the purposive actions of older people in managing their lives-are discussed. This discussion seeks to build recognition of older people's homelessness within gerontology. Social gerontology is rich in understandings of older people's living environments and the circumstances of older people experiencing disadvantage and deprivation. These insights are important to homelessness scholarship and provide important conceptual guidance. This discussion is then linked to homelessness prevention. It is argued that homelessness prevention needs to be tailored to the diverse and complex nature of exclusion as it is experienced by older Australians. → Empirically seek an understanding of older people's homelessness across a range of locales in Australia. In partnership with ACHA agencies the research involved two phases data-mining and semi-structured interviews. Client records were mined for three months at the end of 2012 providing quantitative and qualitative data on 561 older people in housing crisis. The material gained included demographic data, housing history, critical housing incident and living arrangements. In conjunction, interviews with 20 ACHA workers and stakeholders were undertaken. The interviews sought to gain a rich understanding of the circumstances in different locales and housing market contexts, and consider issues such as culture, gender and access to services. The project was exploratory in nature. The analysis of the data was conducted utilising the gerontological and homelessness prevention frameworks outlined above. → Provide a detailed analysis of the nature of older people's homelessness. This was an iterative process utilising the quantitative and qualitative data with the aim of outlining pathways into homelessness in later life. This provides a useful framework for policy and planning processes. In addition the empirical research involved gaining insight into the intervention strategies utilised to address older people's homelessness. Prevention was a particular focus of this analysis. This research project, with its multiple foci, draws on a large amount of individual client case records and insights from interviews with professionals skilled in working with vulnerable older people in housing crisis. It provides a rich and illuminating understanding of homelessness for older Australians. The inclusion of urban, rural and remote areas of Australia in this study not only provides an understanding of different geographies and their respective structural contexts but also encapsulates an understanding of the interplay of gender and culture. Key findings: Older people's homelessness in Australia is predominately about experiencing homelessness for the first time in later years. Previous research in Australia has intimated the importance of first time homelessness among older people. However, these studies have been small exploratory studies. This study, the largest study to date in Australia on older people's homelessness, confirms this distinctive pathway. Pathways to homelessness The study identified three pathways into homelessness for older Australians: 1. People with a history of conventional housing. 2. People who live with ongoing housing disruption. 3. People with a transient housing history. Each pathway has distinctive characteristics and is easily identifiable. Within each pathway there is diversity of experience. While this study is primarily concerned with first time homelessness it is considered important to outline and understand all later life homelessness events in Australia so that we can form a clear picture. The focus of the study was people with a conventional housing history who presented to ACHA with a range of critical housing incidents. On the whole people with a conventional housing history had been renters, mainly in the private market. In order of frequency the critical incidents were grouped as: → Being served a Notice to Vacate (NTV). → Being unable to continue living with family. → Lack of affordable housing options. → Inaccessible housing design making it unsafe to continue residency. → Breakdown in a relationship. The impact of a breakdown in intergenerational housing arrangements and resulting homelessness risk for older people is an important finding in this study. Older people face a housing crisis when they are unable to continue living with family due to carer stress, overcrowding, tension and breakdown and, in a small number of cases, elder abuse. The inability of Australia's housing, particularly the private rental market, to facilitate older people ageing in place was another significant finding. Physical access issues were a dominant reason for older people to be in housing crisis. Notice to Vacate (NTV) and lack of affordability were also common critical housing incidents. This latter finding reinforces our understanding of the deprivation and vulnerability older people reliant on the pension experience while managing private rental payments. In addition, this finding highlights the need to consider accessibility as part of the provision of affordable housing in Australia. The other pathways identified in the study, both with very distinct characteristics, relate to ongoing housing disruption and transience.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903397838

Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid-1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world's most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition, greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay. Campbell dispels long-held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize-winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision. As a national symbol, the Gateway Arch has a singular place in American culture, Campbell concludes, yet it also stands as an instructive example of failed urban planning. © 2013 by Tracy Campbell.

Cross-sectional research design with purposive sampling was employed and the instrument used was a survey form. The findings revealed that 30.8% of the respondents were illiterate and only 5.2% who were computer literate thus, substantiating the myth of digital inclusion among the minorities. With the government's transformation plan to have connected citizens through broadband access, the dilemma was the motivation for this research and inherently, substantiated. Although native minorities in Perak, Malaysia formed the sample size for this study, the implications provide justification for policy analysis on socio-technological inclusion among other disadvantaged groups as culture remains strongly ingrained in their every day existence. However, with time, the new generation may revolutionize the outlook of the indigenous group towards modernity and ICT.

This is in spite of the fact that the layout of a home may significantly direct the life ways of a family or affect their relationships to relatives or neighbours. Lack of consultation has proved problematic in some Indigenous communities, whereas in those few cases where consultation has occurred, the emerging designs have been significantly different from conventional designs. This article describes a four-year process of consultation on cultural concepts in the design of buildings intended for Aboriginal families in urban communities in Manitoba. Participatory design activities drew out numerous themes that, if incorporated into buildings, might help Indigenous families retain or recover their cultural values and lifeways. A number of these Indigenous themes have been incorporated in buildings that have already been constructed.

Design/methodology/approach: The material for this chapter comprises mainly of structured and semi-structured interviews with fishers and other stakeholders in the Archipelago Sea and in the Åland Islands, SW Finland. A governance approach is used, taking into account the interactive social, economic and ecological systems embedded in institutions, social networks and cultures. Findings: The economic importance of traditional fishing livelihood has diminished, but fishing still holds a strong position in the culture and life mode of the local people in the studied archipelago areas. In families selling fish, this income stands typically for a part of the household income and especially wage work has become an important income source in the pluriactivity. Providing services for the tourists and summer cottage dwellers is a potentially growing source of livelihood. The increased recreational use of the Finnish Archipelago Sea has changed the ownership structure of the land area, mostly due to the popular summer cottage dwelling. New public fishing rights for (often urban) recreational fishers have narrowed the scope of the local decision-making and aroused resistance among the local archipelago people. Originality/value: Rural-urban relations and governance aspects have been rarely studied in relation to the use of natural resources.

Design and setting: Population-based study of women giving birth to Aboriginal infants in South Australia, July 2011–June 2013. Women completed a structured questionnaire with an Aboriginal researcher. Study measures include: standardised measure of perceived discrimination in perinatal care; maternal smoking, cannabis use and exposure to stressful events and social health issues; infant birthweight and gestation. Participants: 344 women (mean age 25, range 15–43 years) living in urban, regional and remote areas of South Australia. Results: Half of women (51%) perceived that they had experienced discrimination or unfair treatment by hospitals or health services providing care during pregnancy and soon after childbirth. Women experiencing three or more stressful events or social health issues were more likely to perceive that care was discriminatory or unfair. Aboriginal women who perceived that they had experienced discrimination in perinatal care were more likely to have a baby with a low birthweight (Adj Odds Ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.8) or small for gestational age (Adj Odds Ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.5), adjusting for parity, smoking and cannabis use. Conclusions: The study provides evidence of the ‘inverse care law’. Aboriginal women most at risk of poor infant health outcomes were the least likely to perceive that they received care well matched to their needs.

The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission and to identify risk factors of genotype clustering and the development of large clusters within 3 years in an urban setting in Japan. Design and setting Long-term cross-sectional observational study combining the characteristics of patients with culture-positive TB notified in Shinjuku City, Tokyo (2002-2013), with genotype data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primary outcome measure Genotype clustering rate and association between genotype clustering status and explanatory variables. Results Among 1025 cases, 515 were localised within 113 genotype clusters. The overall clustering rate was 39.2%. Significantly higher rates were found in patients aged <40 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.73, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.44), native Japanese individuals (aOR=3.90, 95% CI 2.27 to 6.72), full-time workers (aOR=1.63, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.27), part-time/daily workers (aOR=2.20, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.58), individuals receiving public assistance (aOR=1.81, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.84) and homeless people (aOR=1.63, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.62). A significant predictor of large genotype clusters within 3 years was a registration interval ≤2 months between the first two cases in a cluster. Conclusion Our results indicated that a large proportion of patients with culture-positive TB were involved in the recent TB transmission chain. Foreign-born persons still have a limited impact on transmission in the Japanese urban setting. Intensified public health interventions, including the active case finding, need to focus on individuals with socioeconomic risk factors that are significantly associated with tuberculosis transmission and clusters with shorter registration intervals between the first two cases. © 2019 Author(s).","clustering rate; foreign-born; homeless; Rflp","adult; Article; cluster analysis; cross-sectional study; disease transmission; DNA fingerprinting; explanatory variable; female; genotype; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; molecular epidemiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; observational study; outcome assessment; population research; risk factor; social care; tuberculosis; urban area; aged; genetics; isolation and purification; Japan; microbiology; middle aged; tuberculosis; urban health; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cluster Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Epidemiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Risk Factors; Tokyo; Tuberculosis; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065698541

Nevertheless, successful adoption failed in many cases, due to a lack of proper understanding of people's actual needs and instead (too much) focus on technical functionality (efficiency emissions). The aim of the project described in this paper is to develop a new cook stove for urban households in Africa, which matches with local cooking habits and which at the same time is scalable which means it should match with multiple cooking habits and cooking ecosystems. In order to address both issues, two design approaches were combined: People-Technology Matching (PTM) and Context Variation by Design (CVD). The objective for the PTM part was to map the characteristics of cooking by measuring and observing preparation of the most typical local food dishes. At the same time, in order to overcome the tension between context specific solutions and scalability, we applied the Context Variation by Design (CVD) approach. Via this approach insights from different contexts are intentionally combined early on in the design process to design a stove-Architecture that can be adopted in and easily adapted to multiple contexts. For this purpose, PTM research was done in two contexts: Uganda and Ghana. The insights collected from the two contexts were brought together and resulted in a stove architecture that is adaptive to both contexts. The resulting prototype performed well in technical tests. We illustrate and discuss some notable features of the adaptive design in the paper. © 2018 IEEE.","clean cooking; context; food culture; human centered design; scalability; technology matching","Efficiency; Scalability; Stoves; Adaptive designs; Clean cooking stoves; context; Design approaches; Human-centered designs; Multiple contexts; Observing preparation; Technical functionalities; Cooking",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061768139

The natural spaces were continually replaced by built-up areas. There is a growing recognition that public open space (POS) in urban areas could offer many desirable human well-being possibilities by interactions with nature. In the current study, we conducted a survey in POS to investigate residents’ recreation features and environmental factors affecting their recreation perceptions. The results show that diversified activity types including both active enjoyment and passive activity were required in urban POS by people in Shanghai, which was different for people from some other countries and cultures. Furthermore, the results have revealed how landscape and environmental factors of POS affect residents’ recreation perceptions. Crime situation, quiet atmosphere, and environmental sanitation have been the three most critical variables of POS concerned by people. For the natural environment in POS, even the diversified species of plants were concerned by most residents, the vegetation density received the relatively lowest preference rating. Overall, planning of a large open grassland with tree patches on the edges is desirable in POS, where visitors could not only get close to nature but also some recreational activities could be carried out. All the findings in this study could give insights into the design and management of urban POS that are favorable for natural places and the health of people in urban areas. © 2019, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Architecture & greenery; Landscape elements; Landscape preference; Outdoor spaces; Questionnaire; Shanghai",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061379044

This is increasingly more critical for children and young people, as educating them to become better citizens, it also do strongly relate with development habits and their awareness of interacting with outdoor environments surrounding them. For inhabitants of cities to live an enriched life in every means, they require more than just the infrastructure and the trappings of material wealth: They require an attachment to a place, a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose, of which, a sound cultural development can help generate. Given the central government's recent emphasis in the 13th 5-year plan on encouraging creative and innovative industries, it is relevant to generate programs on cultural development focusing on younger generations. Through this, municipal governments can improve the quality of life and empower the young generation to shape the long-term prosperity of their cities.

Until recently their culturally distinct clothing has been mainly reserved for ceremonial occasions such as powwows and religious rituals. This bifurcation of clothing styles and contexts parallels the dichotomy between ‘traditional’ and ‘assimilated’ Native identity that has been imposed by the dominant society. The dichotomy is a double bind: adopting ‘traditional’ identities, Native peoples are cast into a static ahistorical frame, while appearing ‘assimilated’ erases cultural distinctiveness. In both cases, Native peoples cannot effectively stake claims to a place in contemporary society. Whereas Jennifer Kramer and Rosemary Coombe advocate ‘double-voiced rhetoric’, that is, ‘oscillation between opposing cultures and systems’, I suggest that First Nations contemporary fashion designers have integrated the opposing identity poles in new clothing styles for everyday wear that simultaneously combine ‘traditional’ and ‘contemporary’ elements. The strategies they use to create this new integrated Aboriginal identity subvert colonial oppression through nation-building initiatives that contribute significantly to fluid and multi-levelled constructions of intertribal Native nationhood. To demonstrate this thesis, I will survey nation-building projects among established nation-states, and show how these historical processes are strikingly similar to the social movement among urban North American Native peoples from the 1960s to the 1970s. I will then demonstrate how contemporary Native Canadian fashion designers use strategies that both materialize and enact intertribal nationhood in the realms of design, production and cultural performance. © 2010 The editor and contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878182174

Some of these assumptions seem to tie leadership to holding office or positions in organizations; others focus on the personal traits of the people who are leaders. Still others seem to conceive of leadership as the ability to contribute to a cause, organization, or process and focus on the effectiveness of different leadership strategies or styles. Finally, there are assumptions that lead to an examination of the relationship between leaders and his or her followers. All of these assumptions inform both the research design and the conclusions reached about political leadership. However, it is not untypical for a study built on one type of assumption about leadership to ignore the other dimensions that form the totality of leadership in urban politics today. Although it is not without value to select a narrow aspect of a field to study, what seems to be occurring in the area of political leadership is a certain blindness as to how the implicit or at least unstated assumptions reflect biases about culture and gender. © 2002 by Routledge.

It also encourages leaders to serve those they manage by propelling them toward high achievement while promoting their professional growth and self-efficacy. Servant-Leadership is also being pioneered as a teaching pedagogy at the Milwaukee School of Engineering, an approach that is unique because most academic institutions subscribe instead to the service-learning model. In conventional academic settings, instructors are the authority figures with control over content, knowledge, assessment, and course outcomes. By contrast, servant-leadership places instructors at the bottom of an inverted power pyramid where they provide a supportive foundation for the students above them. The authors hypothesize that this supportive structure lends itself ideally to faculty mentorship of engineering design-and-build projects; for example capstone senior design projects. In well-managed student projects, faculty members do none of the actual design or construction work. Instead, they mentor a team of students toward successful completion of the challenge. To evaluate the impact of a servant-leadership teaching pedagogy in an engineering setting, an interdisciplinary faculty collaboration was implemented that combined three components: 1) a curriculum-integrated design-and-build project; 2) an industrial engineering project management course; and 3) sponsored service to the community. Service is attractive to college-age people who value global citizenship and stewardship; community projects draw civic-minded perspective students and are highly valued in promoting student recruiting. Within one faculty member's quarter-long senior-level mechanical engineering thermodynamics course, students designed, built, tested, and deployed three miniature aquaponic demonstration units for the Sweet Water Foundation (SWF), a Milwaukee-based non-profit organization. The SWF mission is to teach the public about sustainable urban agriculture. The project's mechanical engineering (ME) students were supported by students taking an industrial engineering (IE) project management course from a different faculty member. IE students served as project managers. Simultaneously, a third faculty member, expert in implementing servant-leadership as a teaching pedagogy, secured project funding from the Brady Foundation while guiding the course instructors in mentoring students as servant-leaders. We report qualitative results from this interdisciplinary project guided by servant-leadership. Instructors report best practices learned by mentoring their engineering students through successful project completion using a servant-leadership teaching pedagogy. We also present and analyze survey data compiled from student participants in the university-wide servant-leadership community to quantify the positive impacts on our institution's culture enabled through community service and faculty mentoring projects using the servant-leadership pedagogy. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.",,"Academic institutions; Capstone senior design; Decision making process; Engineering thermodynamics; Interdisciplinary project; Milwaukee school of engineerings; Non profit organizations; Professional growth; Curricula; Design; Engineering education; Industrial engineering; Mechanical engineering; Project management; Surveys; Teaching; Thermodynamics; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884335672

It is a deep structural crisis that is challenging the foundations of neo-capitalist economic growth model. The aim of this paper is to analyze the recent public policy to promote the development of knowledge economy in the Metropolitan Agglomeration of Seville, the largest in the region. We analyze the one hand, policies to promote the growth of the knowledge economy and, secondly, spatial planning policies of the industries related to the knowledge economy. The sources used in this research are very different. On the one hand, viewed documents coming from different institutions and agencies involved in the formulation and implementation of policies with an impact on the knowledge economy of the area under study. Moreover, we have used the territorial statistical information more common in analysis of the knowledge economy. To complement that information was generated other qualitative, from the derived from twenty semi-structured interviews with institutions and organizations active in the metropolitan area, which took place during 2011; this information has deepened in the knowledge of policies and strategies implemented. The article is divided into six sections. The first is an introduction, followed by a second section focused on territorial and socio-economic characterization of metropolitan agglomeration of Seville and the analysis of the presence of the knowledge economy. The third item is dedicated to public policies promoting the knowledge economy. The fourth section analyzes the policies implemented in the specific sectors that are considered strategic by some of the authorities with responsibilities in the study area. Meanwhile, in the fifth item examines the spatial planning policies that are directly linked with integrated industries in the knowledge economy. Finally, some conclusions are collected. In the metropolitan agglomeration of Seville concentrates most of the economic activities of Andalusia and, in particular, those linked to the knowledge economy (22.52% of enterprises and 29.23% of workers linked to the economy knowledge of the region), however, the weight of these industries in this area is lower than the largest Spanish metropolitan areas. The trend towards concentration of the sectors that make up the knowledge economy also observes within the agglomeration in favor of the main city and the municipalities with the largest population and socio-economic dynamism. If, as has been stated, the policies related to the knowledge economy have gained an increasing interest in recent decades, become even more important in those geographical areas whose economic structural problems hinder the generation of wealth and employment, which puts in demonstrates the importance of these policies in the metropolitan agglomeration of Seville. To analyze these policies, it is necessary to differentiate between policy for economic growth and spatial planning, for while the former are intended to promote the growth of certain industries, second, aimed at minimizing the negative spatial effects generated by such growth. In this sense, analyzing the policies implemented in the study area in question, it can be seen that: Policies promoting the knowledge economy have been implemented by organizations and institutions from different administrative levels, gaining special relevance in the years before the crisis. Nevertheless, the emergence of the crisis has truncated the growth coming to support these sectors and has reduced the attention of current economic policies to promote the knowledge economy. Consequently, the basis on which sits the economic development model of the metropolitan agglomeration of Seville are unchanged, so that it remains, above all, linked to the supply of services, typical of an urban area of more than a million and a half people that also hosts the regional and provincial capital. Spatial planning related to knowledge-based industries, there appears to be contributing to overcome the model based on extensive soil consumption in recent years, and may even have served as an excuse to favor some covert urban developments. It is important to note that most of the actions to promote the knowledge economy are concentrated in the city of Sevilla, and in Dos Hermanas, Alcalá de Guadaira and Mairena del Alcor. Also highlight those in La Rinconada and Sanlúcar la Mayor, where are pursuing sectoral projects and innovative marking of such magnitude that transcend the metropolitan area, as in the case of the location of an aeronautical cluster in La Rinconada and Solar platform in Sanlúcar la Mayor, which is still a landmark worldwide. But it is in the city of Seville where he has developed a greater number of strategies to increase the creative industries and services sectors, which tend to be highly influenced by urbanization economies and the cultural event whose importance goes beyond the metropolitan. As for spatial planning related to the knowledge economy stands creating spaces designed expressly to accommodate such activities. In this regard, while the Science and Technology Park of Cartuja is already filled and the Andalusian Aerospace Technology Park has reached a good level of occupancy, other projects are questionable, especially when taking into account the current economic recession. Do not forget also that in many cases is projected this type of infrastructure, responding only to certain claims and municipal aspirations, which are not based on previous analyzes of territorial trends in the entire metropolitan area. Furthermore, the Spatial Plan of the Urban Agglomeration of Seville emphasized the need to modernize the metropolitan economy, promoting growth of industries linked to knowledge and innovation, without forgetting that it is important to be distributed evenly across the territory. Thus, among the incorporated areas of opportunity to this document, including those classified as technological, seeking to develop and attract knowledge-based industries and distribute evenly through the metropolitan area. In short, as has been pointed out, much of public policies to promote the development of knowledge economy in the metropolitan agglomeration of Seville does not seem to have achieved sufficiently energize. Among the reasons that may explain this circumstance can be highlighted: the own economic downturn resulting from the crisis, the austerity policies that have reduced public budgets considerably in R+D, basic for the generation, transfer and adoption of knowledge, the rise of the value-added tax in the cultural and creative sector, as well as reducing state aid to these sectors. Regarding the spatial planning proposals there are some contradictions that challenge their potential contribution to territorial development. For one, called attention to the large number of areas of opportunity that are planned and the wide area occupied, thus failing to fulfill criteria established urban growth limitation in the Spatial Plan of Andalusia, which is the document that sets out guidelines for the whole region. On the other, although it emphasizes the need to plan actions at supralocal, each of the areas of technological opportunity are located in a single municipality. But the important thing is to design public policies that can lead to a change in the economic model and territorial processes that can generate integrated development, which, in addition to boost economic competitiveness is consistent with the new culture of the territory called (Manifiesto por una nueva cultura del territorio, 2006). At this point, it should be noted, finally, that, in a crisis like the current rapidly changing, lack temporal perspective can draw only tentative conclusions, we add the difficulty of assessing in times of crisis the possible effects of a public policies that have been designed on a bullish economic phase. Furthermore, it should be noted that there is still no information available about the knowledge economy sufficiently disaggregated sectorial and territorially.","Knowledge Economy; Metropolitan Agglomeration of Seville; Policy for Economic Growth; Spatial Planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896761747

These superstitious and cultural beliefs tend to influence treatment seeking behavior of people living with epilepsy (PWE) and their caregivers. STUDY DESIGN: People living with epilepsy in a semi-urban community in Southeast Nigeria were identified in a two phase door-to-door cross-sectional descriptive study. Those identified and their caregivers were further interviewed to determine their concepts of the disease, their treatment (actual and preferred) and what informed treatment. RESULTS: We found 29 cases of active epilepsy, 16 (55.2%) males and 13 (44.8%) females. Witchcraft was held as a major cause of epilepsy in the community accounting for 36.2% (n=17) of the responses. The three major treatment modalities used were spiritual (healing churches), traditional (herbal medicines) and orthodox treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Spiritual treatment was the preferred treatment modality, though most (89.7%) have used traditional (herbal medicine) treatment at one point in the course of the disease. Beliefs on epilepsy and information on the disease obtained mostly from non-medical sources informed treatment. CONCLUSION: The epileptic population studied preferred spiritual treatment though use of traditional treatment was also common. Treatment seeking behavior was greatly influenced by their beliefs and information on the disease obtained mainly from non-medical sources. © 2013, West African Journal of Medicine.

This essential book examines the usefulness of current frameworks for research with GLBT populations and highlights the necessity for greater complexity in the conceptualization and design of research with these populations. It will help you understand the need for more inclusive and representative samples and the need to protect the privacy of GLBT research participants-and ways to accomplish these goals. In addition, Research Methods with Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Populations considers the advantages and limitations of having an ""inside"" perspective when conducting research with these populations. It also explores the myriad ways in which this research can be used to better understand issues facing GLBT communities. Specifically, Research Methods with Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Populations discusses: • eight strategies that ""outsiders"" can use to overcome barriers to doing their work • the challenges of finding and studying older members of gay and lesbian communities • the special challenges that studying gay drug users pose to the researcher • factors affecting research with urban Black and African-American GLBT populations • sampling issues, including ways to overcome the challenges of conducting research with sexual minority adolescents, issues related to dealing with institutional review boards, and lessons derived from empirical articles in the Journal of Gay & Lesbian Social Services • unique features of AIDS service organizations to consider when developing an evaluation strategy • ethical standards for research and evaluation with GLBT populations • and a great deal more! From the Foreword, by Anthony R. D'Augelli: ""In social science research, the effort to extract durable principles of social causality from the apparent randomness of everyday life requires the construction of reliable, if tentative, knowledge that is significantly more informative than mere speculation. With our ever-increasing knowledge base, increasingly sophisticated and powerful quantitative and qualitative methodologies, and with an ever-expanding cadre of researchers, our ability to discern patterns of development of GLBT people from birth to death, the unique qualities of their relationships, and the impact of communities and cultures on the ways in which their sexualities are manifested, will come into sharper focus. In this way, research becomes a tool by which GLBT people transcend invisibility and marginalization. As new research accumulates, the unique contributions that GLBT lives make to our understanding of the nature of human development will be documented in ways never before thought possible. ""Within the larger context of social science research on GLBT populations, this book describes the current status of social service researchers in their quest for methodological sophistication and conceptual complexity. The work of the contributors to this volume exemplifies the progress that has been made since the first research reports on this topic were published."" © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Through anthropological observations of their activities and experiences (1988-1989 and regularly since 1992) in everyday life and special occasions in one such public housing estate named Marine Parade,2 I show and discuss the following: 1) the living diversity of cultures in various public spaces within the local public housing community; and 2) some ethnic, multiethnic and multicultural aspects and issues among those who inhabit, define, negotiate, administer and control these spaces and the complex relationships involved. Through examples and illustrations, I also show that material can be drawn from it to reflect, interpret and symbolize diverse groups and cultures and their relations. In the public-private housing divide that has come to characterize Singapore class society, public housing residents are commonly viewed as that homogeneous lot of ""heartlanders"" (as opposed to ""cosmopolitans"") who live in ""pigeonholes"" in uniform and unaesthetic high-rise blocks of flats in somewhat ""inauthentic"" communities. What I show and discuss is how ordinary people go about their lives meaningfully both because of and despite the planned housing environment, contrary to the common view that such an environment that has replaced the older village or urban street settlement is standard, sterile and starved of spontaneous, organic and interesting life. My focus on people as active agents in their ordinary lives also offers insights into living cultures as part of Singapore and its experience, place-making3 and heritage, beyond those of old buildings/sites, designs and built environments which currently tend to dominate in local heritage discourse. In doing so, I hope to show the contributions of the city's ordinary citizens to its evolution which have thus far tended to escape the planner, critic or outsider with top-down, selective or superficial views of the city and the worlds of its ordinary people. © 2012 Limin Hee, with Davisi Boontharm and Erwin Viray.

This chapter explores the georegion stretching from Georgian Bay eastward to Haliburton and the Algonquin Highlands and from the French River southward to the Trent-Severn waterway and the Oak Ridges Moraine. Although permanently if sparsely settled since the early nineteenth century, it is widely considered a summer leisure destination, and indeed it is now dominated by second homes numbering in the tens of thousands. Residents of major cities in the lower Great Lakes basin have extended their everyday life-spaces to include its waterfront settings for over a century. What once were modest summer cottages are increasingly elaborate permanent dwellings occupied part-time by Greater Toronto Area residents, entrenching the quasi-suburban role of this georegion. This chapter highlights the confluence of abiotic, biotic, and cultural components in the Georgian Bay, Muskoka, and Haliburton georegion, suggesting how its hybrid cultural-natural ecologies stem from its transitional qualities-both symbolically, as an exurban cultural ""edge"" to the Toronto-centred metropolis, and functionally, in geophysical terms. Contemporary Ontario folklore tells us that the province contains a space known as ""cottage country""-a swath stretching from Georgian Bay through Muskoka into Haliburton and the Kawartha Lakes. History shows that this space is more than a hinterland of second homes for an increasingly (sub)urban society. However, at various junctures in human history it has been the home territory and hunting ground for various aboriginal groups, a place of ruthless resource extraction, and (with varying degrees of success) an agricultural area. As a georegion, it is a compelling case study in the confluence of abiotic, biotic, and cultural forces-the ABC paradigm that underlies the case studies in this volume. This chapter traces how these forces have generated a hybrid of cultural-natural ecologies in this georegion. We pay close attention to the georegion's transitional quality. This is true both symbolically-for this area has become an exurban cultural edge to the Toronto-centred metropolitan region-and functionally, in terms of its geology and ecology, since it straddles the transition from the arable St Lawrence Lowlands to the rocky Canadian Shield, with its proliferation of freshwater lakes. By markedly shaping settlement possibilities and patterns, this ""edge"" has also tended to be self-reinforcing. It has embedded itself in the materiality of its own cultural landscapes. Its haunting beauty and ruggedness, in concert with the Anglo-American compulsion to ""escape"" the city, have, moreover, elevated parts of central Ontario to near-mythic status as the very archetype of a summer playground. In this chapter, we present the Georgian Bay/Muskoka/Haliburton georegion through a summary of its physiographic and ecosystem characteristics, along with an account of its human settlement and activity patterns over the past several thousand years. We also introduce a set of critical arguments concerning what this ""cottage country"" georegion now is and what it represents in the Anglo-American world. Key questions are presented as we trace social history from the earliest human settlement through European colonization and the late-nineteenth-century rise of large-scale tourism. Of particular interest is how this georegion has come to be uniquely replete with saleable landscape commodities in the form of waterfront or wateroriented second homes, most of which have been built, owned, and used by city dwellers. Of course, other regions in Ontario, across North America, and around the world are also strongly marked by the presence of second homes. Yet in this area these waterfront settlement patterns represent an especially characteristic intersection of abiotic, biotic, and cultural layers of the landscape of the georegion of which they are part. They are not the only distinguishing features, but they are extremely salient. We suggest ways in which the curious blend of abiotic, biotic, and cultural forces in this georegion can offer hope for the contemporary challenge of getting people to understand the links between ""nature"" and ""culture"" in human settlement systems. Our chapter therefore culminates with a set of comments for planning and design practice. © McGill-Queen's University Press 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898229939

One promising venue for testing such claims is the capital city, since-by definition-such places need to represent the seat of government and other ""national"" institutions. At the same time, capital cities are not equivalent to nation-states; they are still separately identifiable as cities, even though they are certainly cities of a very specialized kind. The act of designing a new capital city-or building significant new ""national"" institutions in an existing capital city-forces an engagement with questions of national representation.1 Specifically, how are multiple social identities constructed through architecture and urban design? And, if such constructed identities matter, which groups in a plural society see themselves as represented in what gets built to represent supposedly national institutions? Does a capital city represent an opportunity to provide an alternative to nationalist discourse and subnational divisions, or does it serve to reinforce the sense that some people are included in the conception of the nation-state much more so than others? In this chapter, I attempt to argue three things: 1. A wide variety of regimes have used urban design and architecture to advance a nationalist agenda, and this ""design politics"" operates at all visible scales. 2. When such regimes give in to the temptations of nationalism, the results are usually very divisive. 3. Conversely, it is possible to imagine ways that architecture and urban design can be used to heal political rifts. Ernest Gellner, in his book Nations and Nationalism, defines nationalism as ""a theory of political legitimacy"" which holds that ""the political and the national unit should be congruent"" (Gellner 1983, 1). In other words, the political unit-what we generally call the nation-state, or more informally the ""country""-and the national unit should coincide exactly if they are superimposed. The problem is that the world is not organized this way, largely due to a long history of empires and colonialism, not to mention a variety of supranational political and economic alliances. If, as one extreme example demonstrates, one compares a map of Africa subdivided according to the borders of nation-states with a map showing the far more fine-grained subdivisions of ethnic groups that fall both within and across the boundaries of many nation-states, the two bear little resemblance and help explain major internal and international tensions. It is true that the system of African nation-states is far more equitable than the coarse grain of the imperially divided spoils that characterized the map of the earlier colonized continent, but the legacy of a continent fragmented by the wills of European colonists still suffers from the legacy of irrationally imposed borders. The modern system of nation-states-built mostly in the last two centuries (and especially during the last sixty years, a time when the number of nation-states has more than tripled) has not been easily superimposed on the system of ethnically defined nations or would-be nations, many of which find themselves to be subdivisions (or minority groups within) a nation-state that they do not recognize as legitimate. In short, the maps that depict peoples do not correspond very well with the maps that depict places. If one turns to a reputable source like the newest American Heritage Dictionary, which is often serviceable for most purposes (though even that book's name seems to raise additional questions about this very topic), the proffered definitions of nationalism seem at least as evasive or incomplete as Gellner's. In the first instance, according to the American Heritage, nationalism denotes ""devotion to the interest or culture of one's nation."" What is not said, of course, is that ""nation"" in this sense may not exactly coincide with one's nation-state. In other words, nationalism can often be about devotion to some subnational portion of a pluralist nation-state that is attempting to harness and discipline many constituent nations within it. Nationalism can also be counter-posed to internationalism, as when the dictionary defines it as ""the belief that nations will benefit from acting independently rather than collectively, emphasizing national rather than international goals."" Finally, nationalism may denote ""aspirations for national independence in a country under foreign domination."" This latter aspect seems particularly important, since it implies that nationalism is not necessarily tied to some fixed moment in political history. There is a nationalism of aspiration-embraced by those who do not yet control a nation-state but think that they should-as well as a nationalism of consolidation-championed by those who do control a nation-state but are struggling to make sure that the aspiring nations within its borders do not succeed in undermining the state's sovereign legitimacy. What I refer to as the ""temptation of nationalism"" in the title of this chapter is largely focused on the latter kind of nationalism. For those that are still aspiring to become nation-states, ""the temptation of nationalism"" is no more than an obvious tautology. For nation-states struggling to maintain their political hold on their constituent peoples (or to extend their hold onto adjacent territory), however, this nationalism of consolidation is both urgent and difficult to construct. Nationalism in this sense is a two-stage proposition: the first stage-the nationalism of aspiration-supports a drive for independence in the name of freedom and self-determination, and the second stage-the nationalism of consolidation-is what is needed to define the self that has been freed. As political scientist Crawford Young puts it, the state which, before independence, had been the ""foil against which unity was forged"" is, after independence, ""itself the main vehicle in the hands of the nationalist elite for the fulfillment of the mission"" (Young 1978, 71). In other words, nationalist movements begin as struggles against the state but, if they succeed, they suddenly have to become the state, themselves. Because the hold on power is uncertain, the leaders of a nation-state are tempted to take nationalistic positions that endeavor to suppress or supersede pre-independence subnational identities that are not useful to the dominant group in power. The temptation of nationalism is the promise of unity and legitimacy, the dream of a consolidated nation-state unchallenged by those who would unravel it or secede. © 2011 by Indiana University Press.

The result is a new generation of users extending their everyday experiences into these emerging digital ecologies. However, what happens when users re-create their human identity in these spaces? How do the tools of new technologies such as the mobile phone allow them to capture and share their experiences? In order to address these issues, this chapter presents the findings from a three-year study into mobile phone use in urban culture. The study revealed that for a new generation, the mobile phone was integral in the formation of fluid social interactions and had accelerated urban mobility. Users once restrained by pre-made plans were able to spontaneously traverse the city and suburbs, swarming between friendship groups and activities. Distinct user archetypes emerged from these mobile phone driven sub-cultures whose practices brought about fundamental changes in social mores with respect to engagement and commitment, to notions of fluid time versus fixed time and, ultimately, to urban mobility. Connectivity had become central to what it means to have a social identity and users responded to this by merging bits of data to create their ""ideal digital self"" through which they communicate socially. Yet, recent developments in mobile phone design reveal the potential for a new generation of people to recontextualize their use in a way that moves beyond ""the social"" as they utilise sensors and data capturing and sharing functionalities in new mobile devices to augment their ""social butterfly"" identity with an ideology of a ""socially conscious urban citizen."" © 2009, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898276208

The quest was initially undertaken to find out about ""potolo"" weavings. The Jalq'a people were found in numbers totaling 25,000 impoverished and with very high infant mortality rates, low incomes, and social disorganization. although the traditional woven dresses were still worn, the color combinations and motifs had lost their originality and precision. The story was told about how during the 1960s and 1970s the poor cash economy had forced people to sell their textiles to tourists and traders for lower than market value. Eventually it became apparent that there were no longer models of the traditional garments to inspire new generations. Upon the anthropologists arrival and inquiries, it was related that local interest to revive production of these native textiles was still there. The craft revival took root because of the interest in the people not just as artisans but as people, and rapport was established. The background of the anthropologists is related. A grassroots support organization (GSO) was formed to assist in economic development that was rooted in the life of the community. The pace was set by participants and a few women at first were trained in commercial production. A shaman was asked to conduct a ritual ceremony which involved calling upon the mountain deities, the Mallkus, to give them a sign. The Mallkus agreed the project was good and the Jalq'a must conserve their language and culture and textiles. New workshops were blessed in a similar way. In the first workshop the challenge was for the women to determine how to make the many strange animals that appeared in Jalq'a designs; a photographic archive was put together and the hand-dyed colors restored with some difficulty. The exhibit of the textiles after several years led to new respect for the Jalq'a and indigenous peoples and a means of recognition for further sales. Women's status and Irupampa socioeconomic status has improved; migration to urban areas has been slowed. The experiences of the Navajo in the US has been helpful in the Jalq'a efforts in international marketing. GSO has been able to provide guidance to others in learning about their spinning machines, quality control system, and marketing strategy.",,"American Indian; anthropology; article; Bolivia; case report; Case Studies; Critique; cultural anthropology; Cultural Background; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; economic development; Economic Factors; economics; employment; ethnic group; human rights; industry; Informal Sector; Macroeconomic Factors; population; population and population related phenomena; research; Research Methodology; socioeconomics; sociology; South America; South and Central America; Studies; Western Hemisphere; Women's Status; Americas; Anthropology; Anthropology, Cultural; Bolivia; Case Studies; Critique; Cultural Background; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Economic Development; Economic Factors; Ethnic Groups; Indians, South American; Industry; Informal Sector; Latin America; Macroeconomic Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Research Methodology; Social Sciences; Socioeconomic Factors; South America; Studies; Women's Status; Americas; Anthropology; Anthropology, Cultural; Bolivia; Case Report; Culture; Demography; Developing Countries; Economics; Employment; Ethnic Groups; Evaluation Studies; Indians, South American; Industry; Latin America; Population; Population Characteristics; Research; Social Sciences; Socioeconomic Factors; South America; Women's Rights",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027017420

According to the socioecological approach the association of physical environments and psychosocial factors in the context of park-based PA of elderly have not been systematically examined until now, let alone the relevance of the city (urban area) on a cross-cultural level. This study investigated selected aspects of (1) the association of psychosocial and park environmental factors with park-based physical activity (PBPA) of older people; and (2) the moderating effect of city on the association of these factors with PBPA. Methods: A face-to-face survey was conducted of a mixed-culture sample from different urban surroundings in Hong Kong (HK) and Leipzig (L). In six parks of each city physically active elderly (> = 60 years; HK: n = 306; L: n = 311) were recruited. Multiple linear regressions were used to analyse the association between psychosocial factors and perceived environmental factors with PBPA and the moderating effect of city. Results: Controlled for demographic variables, all other psychosocial factors were significantly related to PBPA, except social support. In terms of environmental factors, PBPA was positively associated with safety, attractiveness, features and negatively associated with park time distance. Controlled for demographic variables, psychosocial and environmental factors, the moderating effect of city on the associations of park features and park time distance with PBPA was not significant in HK. In contrast, there was a significant positive relationship for park features and a negative relationship for park time distance with PBPA in L. Conclusions: Psychosocial and perceived environmental factors significantly influence PBPA of older people. City moderates the associations of these factors and independently contributes to park-based PA of the elderly. The different interactions of environmental factors and urban area for PBPA of elderly can support policy makers on the municipal level in choosing adequate strategies for promoting PA of older people in parks. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cities; Elderly; Mixed-culture sample; Park-based physical activity; Psychosocial and perceived environmental factors; Urban Park","aged; article; city; demography; environmental factor; female; Germany; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; male; mixed cell culture; physical activity; recreational park; social support; urban area; city; environmental planning; exercise; Germany; Hong Kong; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; urban population; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cities; Environment Design; Exercise; Female; Germany; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parks, Recreational; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077848917

Rural ecotourism is a new type of tourism produced for people to experience rural scenery. In order to ensure the sustainable development of rural eco-tourism, it is necessary to analyze its planning in many aspects. In this study, Tianjin rural eco-tourism was analyzed using the superiority, weakness, opportunity and threats analysis method. Then, according to the analysis, the superiority, weakness, opportunity and threat were obtained, and they were quantitatively analyzed by means of a questionnaire. The results showed that the development of Tianjin rural eco-tourism had four superiorities, i.e. convenient transportation, rich water resources, rich animal and plant resources and rich eco-tourism resources; three weakness, i.e. homogeneous content, unclear theme and low quality of staff; three opportunities, i.e. government support, effective combination of local culture with tourism activities and increased demand for tourism; and two threats, i.e. fierce competition among peers and diversified demands of tourists. In the comprehensive quantitative analysis, the comprehensive scores of superiorities, weakness, opportunities and threats were 3.6, −2.8, 4.4 and −4.4, respectively. To sum up, Tianjin rural ecotourism has superiorities over weakness and equivalent opportunities and threats; i.e. it is basically in a state of sustainable development. © The Author(s) 2020.

Additionally, to define the indicators and principles that can enhance social capital within urban design context. Moreover, to suggest theoretical urban neighborhood design concept that can adopt the changing discourse of social capital. Design/methodology/approach: This research used the theoretical, analytical and descriptive approach-driven case study method. In all, 29 papers were analyzed to conclude the indicators that can measure social capital within the urban neighborhood design context and to conclude the required neighborhood design features and principles that influence social capital. Additionally, two new urban neighborhoods design concepts, cohousing and hybrid concepts that adopt new forms of social interaction, were studied, analyzed and then synthesized to suggest new neighborhood design concept, which is a heterotopia concept. Findings: Heterotopia neighborhood concept aims to create real, different and heterogeneous functional spaces with different layers of meanings for people from different cultures in one place. Different visible enclosures are merged into spaces of otherness while the diversity gives a sense of entering another alternative place. The heterotopias neighborhood design principles aim to create a wide variety of forms, shapes and elements [different new spaces for different ritual activities to reflect the otherness self-reflection (homogeneous and scattered spaces)] and create linkage, hierarchy, contrast and mingling between spaces and places; well-defined functional effective spaces; different fantasy and leisure spaces; high standard quality of life and otherness space; flux in social realm and fluidity of spaces; mixed use and joint experience; and innovated technologies spaces to offer strange new temporalities. Research limitations/implications: This research recommended that different community stakeholders should participate in planning process, neighborhood urban design and decision-making process about public spaces to strengthen the community ties and achieve a heterotopia concept. Architect, urban designers and planners should adopt bottom-up design approach when designing neighborhood. Additionally, to avoid poor social capital research studies, the new researchers, practitioners and journal reviewers approaching social capital for the first time must read widely to gain an understanding of the concept from different perspectives and narrow their scope to their particular area of interest. Practical implications: This research highlights the needs for empirical studies to examine the relationships/interrelationships between all neighborhood design principles and social capital. This might increase the knowledge on how we can design and increase the quality of neighborhood to foster social capital, which might offer interesting insights into how neighborhood urban design principles are combined to foster social capital within neighborhood context. Originality/value: Neighborhood-based research encourages new suggesting concepts in designing every single place in the residential neighborhood in a way that can adapt the new forms of social interaction. This research scanned the current concepts of neighborhood design that concerned successfully with the changing forms of social relationships to conclude some design features and principles for neighborhood design to ensure and promote social public health and well-being. This research offers a unique perspective for better understanding the relationships between the neighborhood urban design as a spatial dimension and social capital. This research aims to enrich the socio-spatial knowledge and build a resilient urban community by suggesting theoretical urban neighborhood design concept, which is the heterotopia concept, and providing the urban designers and architects with a valuable thinking tool to design spaces. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cohousing; Heterotopia spaces; Hybrid spaces; Neighborhood design; Social capital",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067312545

There are many issues related to the integration and dialogue between cultures. Urban design plays a key role in how migrants participate in their host community and it is an important driver for the inclusion process. Facilitating the participation of residents in designing public spaces and their use helps to create a better sense of belonging. Promoting in public spaces the interaction of different cultures becomes a crucial element to facilitate social cohesion and living together. The research project explores an innovative approach in the use of public spaces, through the design of smart urban furniture. Based on a survey of the user’s needs, and on co-design activities, the project investigates innovative solutions for facilitating migrants’ integration and the dialogue between different cultures, through the design of innovative urban furniture, with smart technologies embodied inside.

A need to create a new model based on the concept of ecosystem arises from the research, where the laws of nature and culture of each place will be seriously considered in formulating development policy. A key-element for ecological spatial planning is the carrying capacity of ecosystems. The aim of spatial planning appears to be the sustainability of natural systems in order to be able to sustain and supply the anthropogenic systems, meeting the 'real' human needs. For the implementation of these and the exit from the crisis of utmost importance the role of education is highlighted in creating active citizens, who are required to undertake, through self-organization [1, 2], to promote eco-development and eco-design. © 2017 PSP.","Eco-development; Environment; Spatial planning (regional, urban)","crisis management; environmental planning; implementation process; interdisciplinary approach; international organization; quality of life; regional planning; self organization; spatial planning; specialization; sustainability; sustainable development; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047363465

Displacing development of the Chinese countryside to make way for expensive housing and large hotels is a regularity. This paper looks at the Yanoda Ecotourism Zone Planning project in Hainan, China as an example of the method of the Ecotourism and Sustainable Development approach. The design team thoroughly collected and analyzed the natural and culture elements of the area, and hosted public meetings of all parties including local governmental, developer, local farmers, potential buyers and came up an innovated master plan for the 164 km2 (40,525 acres) project areas that all parties receive some benefit; at the same time, the natural resource and cultural character of the area was preserved in a maximize way. The Ecoland design team also came up with a demonstration design for Phase I area as well as a design guideline for the rest of the project area. Three years after the project, the local residents' income, the government tax income from tourism, and developer's investment return have all proved the success of the development. The goal of preserving the sensitive environmental area was accomplished as well. By incorporating scientific research, urban infrastructure, and job training, the plan shows that the goals of ecological, cultural, and economic sustainability can be combined to create a successful development for all parties involved. The result is a popular tourist destination that has the support of both the people and the government. Yanoda Ecotourism Zone shows how a model developed with the community can lead to successful future growth. The master plan for Yanoda is not merely a guideline for development but a model for a system of continued sustainability and growth. © 2017 The Authors.","biodiversity; countryside beautifulcation; Ecotourism; greenway; master planning; planning; Sanya; sustainable development; urbanization","Biodiversity; Ecology; Investments; Planning; countryside beautifulcation; Eco-tourisms; Greenways; Master planning; Sanya; urbanization; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029838535

The 13 villages (ksar/ksour in Arabic) in M’Hamid share many sociological, urban, and architectural similarities with the ksour located in the pre-Saharan valleys. These similarities range from environmental threats, such as extreme climate, to the current social and economic model. As a result, the settlements are being abandoned, and the tangible and intangible heritage of the Drâa Valley is in a progressive disappearance. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: To deal with the complexity of this problem, a progressive approach beginning at the territorial scale must be developed. In this regard, a lasting solution can be found only by promoting development that integrates nature, culture, and architecture, as well as by finding a new balance of these elements within the current social and economic requirements. Findings: This paper presents part of the research conducted by the team of the Terrachidia Association, which allows an overall understanding of the place. To this aim, the new social and economic context of the Drâa Valley is pointed out, as well as the characteristic features of M’Hamid architecture and urbanism. In this regard, the principles and requirements of its conservation are presented, and the project of the Terrachidia Association is also described. Finally, the project’s impact is assessed and the results of the set of interventions are evaluated. Practical implications: Since 2012, the activity of the Terrachidia Association has focussed on the study, promotion, preservation, and restoration of the architectural and cultural heritage of M’Hamid. The main activity of the association focusses on the organization of workshops, which are attended mainly by university students and professionals from around the world. Social implications: In total, 13 workshops were organized since 2012, thanks to the engagement of the local population. In this period, around 300 participants from more than 15 different countries attended these workshops, working with approximately a 100 local craftsmen. All of them share a similar commitment to the work that Terrachidia is developing. These workshops allow the participants to know places and people in a way hardly achievable through conventional tourism. At the same time, this awareness is also achieved in the local population, and cultural exchange strengthens its identity. Originality/value: The purpose of the workshops organized by Terrachidia is manifold, and the participants actively take part in the restoration works while they interact and exchange experiences with a reality that is generally unknown in western societies. The local population also benefits from this cultural exchange by strengthening their identity, which is linked to architecture, and demonstrating the economic possibilities of conservation through responsible tourism. And these aims are achieved through a self-managed project, which benefits all involved. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural heritage; Earthen architecture conservation; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009830499

However, as it is obvious that these are closely integrated, the method and idea of the urban survey reflect the bilateral relationship between perceiving and conceiving urban space. This study will explain how urban surveys transformed and reflected the ideas and interests in urban space and its study in Japan from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1980s. Especially in examining a research named ""Modernology"" by a Japanese architect Wajiro Kon from 1925 to 1930, and the works of later Japanese architects inspiered by ""Modernology"" after 1960s, this study will explain how they tried to create urban studies with cultural identity by conducting surveys and integrating with international theories. ""Modernology""described the emerging urban space and people's way of life in Tokyo, and was often recognized as a method of popular culture. However, Modernology represented critical aspects of social space and encouraged people to be more engaged with it. While modernist architects distanced from urban realities to solve its problems scientifically, Modernology was often recognized as their counter part. When we recognize its primal objectives and influence on later generation in seeking the social ethos in the dialectical progress with the bilateral approaches between surveying and planning, we can understand the alternative aspect of Japanese urban studies. ©The Author(s) 2016.","anthropology; Christopher Alexander; Design Survey; everyday phenomena; fashion; idea of urban space; Konpeito and Iryuhin Kenkyujo; lifestyle; marketing theory; Modernology; Patrick Geddes; social survey; Street Observation Society; Tokyo; visual description; Wajiro Kon","anthropology; cultural identity; modernity; nineteenth century; theoretical study; twentieth century; urban history; urban planning; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968833661

It proves that the relationship between architecture and geography is not merely an embodiment of physical and functional demands but rather a formal expression of the materialization of culture. After analyzing the vast number of villages, groups of buildings and individual buildings the forms of which closely resemble the forms of the Bagua (symbol of the Eight Trigrams), Taichi, animals and plants, this book finds that this kind of symbolism creatively places living and working places within the natural geographic environment and, by seeking a relationship between architecture and its surrounding environment, comes to express people’s hopes and dreams, evolving slowly to take on certain cultural connotations. This book is the fourth of a 4-volume book series. The series develops the innovative concept of “geo-architecture” by exploring the myriad influences of natural, human and historical factors upon architecture. These influences are considered in three categories, namely, interaction between architecture and nature, interaction between architecture and its human users and change in architecture over time--each category serves as a lens. Augmenting these lenses is the Time-Person-Place concept applied different geographic. The analysis ultimately focuses on two aspects: geographic influence on architecture and architectural response to geography. The over 1000 pictures of case architectures enriches the study with stunning and unique visual angles. ""This unprecedented work will be a unique and valuable contribution to the literature.

One might point to their pluralisation and fragmentation - into the cultural industries - alongside continuing processes of agglomeration and concentration. It would involve recognition of their more contradictory and ambiguous relationship to those wider processes of power and control articulated within and through their structures and products. This work of retrieval and complication, done under the broad rubric of the political economy of culture, communications and/or media, had been under way in North America, France and the United Kingdom (UK) since the 1970s (Mosco, 1996). Unlike other approaches - notably that of cultural studies - the political economy approach was less concerned with the high/low, art/commerce distinction than it was with the role of media and communications systems in the reproduction of a complex modern (capitalist) society. It wanted to know how, and on what grounds, might the modern democratic state organise or regulate such a system, and what complex social, economic and political considerations needed to be made in the light of this. It was very much engaged - not implacably opposed but engaged - in the heated debates about the de-or re-regulation of the broadcast media and new kinds of commercial and public sector channels coming into being across the 1990s (Hesmondhalgh, 2013a). Elsewhere the reckoning with the Culture Industry took a local turn. A book on the cultural industries in the mid-1990s might evoke an eclectic new set of producers and intermediaries who mixed art, popular culture, technology and a kind of streetwise entrepreneurialism quite tangential to the formal structures of the arts funding system (Wynne and O’Connor, 1996; Leadbeater and Oakley, 1999). Community arts and new social movements combined with a contemporary popular culture (animated by the spirit of cultural studies) to embrace an urbanism re-emerging from under the rusted hulks of the Fordist city (Bianchini and Parkinson, 1993). These announced a new potential for local re-invention. By the mid-1990s consultancy and local government reports in the UK were identifying this new breed of cultural producers as being in possession of the kind of qualities required for a transformed city - a city with the potential to take its future in its own hands, no longer determined by the accidents of geography and geology. Autopoesis rather than autonomy was the watchword, as endogenous growth based on re-inventing and mobilising existing strengths became an alternative to the disempowering script of attracting mobile global capital. Though often thought of as some kind of economism or instrumentalism by which the arts sector attempted to protect its shrinking funding base, the cultural industries at local level tried to diffuse the structuring tension between culture and economy. As culture was becoming more important economically so too ‘economics’ (though the discipline was lagging behind the reality perhaps) was finally acknowledging the reality of culture. The cultural industries might not be the whole solution to the questions raised by the socio-economic transformation of the post-industrial city, but whatever the solution there was little doubt culture would be part of it. Nicholas Garnham - involved in the experiments of the Greater London Council 1979-86 (Garnham, 1990) - linked these political economy and urban development strands together: both contemporary democracy and democratic cultural policy at multiple scales demanded an engagement with the realities of the production, distribution and consumption of culture. It is less likely that such a book - in the Anglophone world at least - would acknowledge that they were in the middle (1988-97) of the World Decade for Culture and Development (WCCD, 1996). Emerging out of a number of United Nations umbrella organisations - in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) - the ‘culture and development’ tradition emphasised both the cultural context in which development necessarily took place and the values articulated by this culture as a crucial benchmark of a qualitatively human rather than technocratic development process (Arizpe, 2004; De Beukelaer, 2015; Isar, this volume). In this the cultural industries, conceived as a modern cultural infrastructure of production, distribution and consumption, were crucial both to nation building and protecting local identity in the face of a globalising culture. Growing out of the failure of the NewWorld Information and Communications Order (UNESCO, 1980; Mosco, 1996; Singh, 2011), the cultural turn in development studies (as generally in the social sciences) and post-colonial and post-development literatures, ‘culture and development’ combined both an anthropological and a political economy approach to cultural industries. However, in the metropolitan heartlands, worried by the domestic employment impact of the re-location of manufacturing to the ‘developing world’, the cultural industries appeared primarily as a developed world option. Ten years on and the landscape had changed considerably. First the creative industries, and then creative economy, had either replaced or been bolted on to the cultural industries: cultural and creative, or cultural creative. Indeed there were other couplings such as art and cultural, art and creative, creative and digital; or various idiosyncratic terms such as ‘copyright’, ‘attention’ or ‘experience’ industries/ economies. Many at the time saw this as a purely pragmatic title change, or were ‘what’s in a name’ agnostic; it was not immediately clear how the replacement of ‘cultural’ by ‘creative’ worked both to preserve and to expunge elements traditionally associated with ‘culture’. ‘Creativity’ as an input (rather than culture as an output) allowed the imaginative, dynamic, transformative and glamorous aspects of culture to be pressed into the service of an innovation machine. Questions of value other than innovation and other economic impacts were dropped. That this was not immediately apparent says a lot about the cultural industries ‘imaginary’(s) of the mid-1990s, which should neither be reduced to a simple ‘precursor’ of the creative industries nor viewed as a radically distinct set of ideas and aspirations (O’Connor, 2013). In general, the kinds of loose coalitions that pursued the creative industries agenda grew out of those involved in the cultural industries. They were concerned with cultural small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs, regenerating cities and regions, programming new kinds of mixed use cultural spaces, setting up local development agencies, re-tooling higher and further education courses, developing training programmes and sometimes, via the relevant culture or trade ministries, trying to influence legislation or gain political legitimation. Three developments altered this easy continuity. First came the explosion of the Internet and digital and computing technologies generally, with their reconfiguration of the established nature of, and connections between, cultural production, texts and audiences. The UK government’s addition of computing and information and communication technology (ICT) to the ‘creative industries’ list in 1998 has been frequently commented on (Garnham, 2005; Tremblay, 2011). Not only did it boost the employment numbers, often by around 40 per cent, but it worked to subsume the cultural (now creative) sector under the rubric of the knowledge economy. Many promoting the cultural industries had already positioned culture as part of the knowledge economy but its imaginary had shifted from that of a city or region able to re-invent itself through resources of culture towards the capacity to release the heroic entrepreneurial energies eulogised by the Californian ideology. It seemed incontrovertible that the ‘digital revolution’ was transforming the land- scape of (what had been) the cultural industries, pulling the plug on their business models, bringing in new entrants, transforming the way audiences interacted, purchased and adapted cultural texts. In this light the creative industries, with their horizontal networks, co-creative practices, and open-ended texts providing digital affordances for the creative citizen-consumer, could be seen to incarnate (and make redundant) many of the transformative aspirations of the cultural industries (Hartley, 2005). The creative industries announced a new kind of economy that drew on cultureinflected creativity within a (transformed) commercial sector that was as far away from Adorno’s Culture Industry as one could possibly imagine. At the same time - given the radical flattening of hierarchies and the infinite creativity of the consumer - it could simply sidestep the dour strictures of political economy. Second came Richard Florida’s creative class, which seemed to encapsulate - and indeed statistically nail - the broad connections between culture and the future of the post-industrial city that had emerged in the 1990s (Florida, 2002). The simplicity of the idea - build ‘cool’, ‘edgy’ places in the city as amenities to attract artists and cultural workers, scientists and technicians, senior management and professionals - has both been routinely denounced and phenomenally successful (Peck, 2010). Florida’s opening out of arts-led regeneration to embrace hip, popular and everyday cultures (lifestyles) was welcomed as a democratic move. It also made the spaces of cool consumption - and of course local cities could insert almost any new development into this space - a synecdoche for the wider creativity of the city (even though the real economy might lie elsewhere). It was this unspecified - yet seemingly statistically demonstrable - catalytic connection between a trendy consumption infrastructure and the overall creativity of the city that proved irresistible to the elected officials - if not the cultural managers - of many otherwise sensible cities. The third change was perhaps the most surprising - certainly for the agency that had come up with the term in the first place. Soon after the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) launched the ‘creative industries’ idea in 1998, it was taken up by the very East Asian countries - or ‘economies’ as they had become known - from whose manufacturing prowess these new industries were meant to allow the postindustrial countries to escape. Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and eventually China enthusiastically embraced the creative industries as the next step up the value chain (Wang, 2004; O’Connor and Gu, 2006; Kong et al., 2006; Keane, 2007). Taking seriously the evolutionary schema that was mostly political rhetoric in the UK - from a manufacturing to a service to a creative economy - these East Asian nations, also unlike the UK, put their money where their mouths were. In so doing they took seriously the notion of creative industries as intellectual property (IP) intensive and thus included in their lists bio-tech, pharmaceuticals, software and computing, product design, consulting and other advanced business services. They split them off from culture - which (somewhat off message) they saw as involving non-economic values - and subjected them to the kinds of ‘catch-up’ strategies they had earlier applied to advanced manufacture and other high-value added industries. This created unexpected opportunities for agents such as the British Council - the brand leader - as western know-how was sought for these emergent industries. What they got was not quite what they wanted. Creativity and entrepreneurialism was very much linked to the artistic persona - the maverick, the rebel, the non-wearing of a suit. It also depended on notions of open, loose but high trust networks of SMEs that - according to the rhetoric at least - marked the kind of creative economies emerging in the West. What East Asia wanted were industry strategies, foreign direct investment, value chain analysis, brand management, market structuring and so on. These were rarely available from western cultural agencies who masked the complete absence of any kind of capacity, or willingness, for an industry strategy in the rhetoric of unplanned, market-driven creativity, where the job of the state was to get out of the way. These kinds of cultural-creative initiatives continue to operate in East Asia out of the various offices of the British Council and similar agencies from Germany, the Low Countries and Scandinavia. But they were often symbolic inputs. The real learning was from direct contact with the people who really knew - the global cultural corporations and their attendant consultancy companies (O’Connor and Gu, forthcoming). The least successful export was the creative class. Eagerly adopted in Hong Kong, it quickly ran into problems when the persona of the ‘creative’ and the kinds of cultural ambiance they required - ethnic diversity, gay (friendly) businesses, bohemian enclaves - were deemed to be less than desirable. The new creative economy was to be run by serious people in nice suits and dresses, not BoHos. More popular was the older ‘high culture’ or arts-led regeneration. This had its brand impact - but it also took culture out of direct generation of wealth in ways that suited the ‘traditional’ outlook of East Asia. © 2015 Kate Oakley and Justin O’Connor for selection and editorial matter; individual contributions the contributors.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110729887

However, little has been known about how such a provision takes place and what kind of participation can lead to the resilience of a community. This paper presents a field report which seeks to reveal the nature of participation in a social media-enabled urban farming community. Through an interpretive case study, the findings demonstrate interconnectedness of the community involving people, place, and technology. Three areas of contributions are outlined: a wider application of design framework for sustainable food culture, the role of social media for social participation through urban farms, and the route to building community resilience from social media-enabled participation.

It analyses the relationship between freedom and control to identify phenomena and offer users and policymakers instructions for achieving that balance. Public space, including privately owned public space, is important to urban living. People have both the right to use public space and the responsibility to protect it. Both freedom and control should exist in public space in an appropriate combination. It is impossible and inappropriate for us to ask for absolute freedom or endure unreasonable control.Design/methodology/approach – A case study of Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) reveals typical freedom/control relationships. Quantitative descriptions are given based on field observations.Findings – Freedom and control are primary factors affecting the quality of urban life and management of city space. They depend on and conflict with each other. The balance between freedom and control is a balance between diverse spaces. The “freedom space” belonging to both citizens and authorities determines whether freedom and control are balanced. Ethics and strategies constitute control. Only when each authority and user obtains a proper freedom space can freedom and control achieve balance in public space.Research limitations/implications – Freedom and control differ across cities because they are both affected by culture, history and tradition. As each city has its own characteristics, the freedom and control in each open space are distinctive. Balancing freedom and control requires an understanding of a city’s background and the era. While this paper does not attempt to achieve this understanding, further studies could devote more attention to dimensions of time and location.Practical implications – The findings provide recommendations for users, policymakers and construction and management companies that will allow the management of harmonious and high-quality open spaces.Social implications – Freedom and control are two main factors affecting quality of life. The balance between freedom and control may bring a harmony and stable society environment. It would benefit both the authority and the people a lot.Originality/value – This study provides a systematic analysis of freedom and control in public space and makes a valuable contribution to quality urban space policy, design and management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Control; Environmental management; Ethics; Freedom; Policy; Public space",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916232702

One cultural aspect where this can be seen is in the relatedness and interrelatedness of wedding rituals including songs, customs, norms and rites. Through the narrations of urban women in Zanzibar, this paper offers insights into this cultural intermingling when it comes to weddings and gives voice to the self-understandings of women, reflecting on their own lives, circumstances, and culture. The article concentrates on the singo (scrubbing) ritual and henna application (kuchora na kupaka hina), two important customs observed a few days before the actual wedding. The intent is to show the cosmopolitanism of these wedding rituals.

It then presents some important changes that have developed over the last ten years in the world and their potential influence on the future. In France, 95% of towns of more than 10 000 residents have a wastewater treatment plant. Construction of new plants reached 730 installations in 1976, but has since declined to less than 300/year. Among 11 310 sites of more of 200 inhabitants, 5% utilize only primary treatment and 50% utilize the activated sludge process which represents 60% of the treatment capacity. In order to satisfy the European directive of May 21st 1991, approximately 36 billion French Francs should be invested between 1994 and 2005. This investment represents new wastewater treatment facilities for 17 million people. In Quebec, construction of wastewater treatment plants occurred mainly during the 80's and 90's. Today, nearly 80% of the population is served by wastewater treatment plants, which represent approximately 4,9 million residents. This accounts for a flow rate of 5,3 million cubic meters per day. Among 450 municipal treatment plants, those of the urban communities of Montreal and Quebec represent nearly 60% of the total wastewater treatment capacity of Quebec. Physico-chemical treatment plants are the most significant (6 plants for 2,28 million residents) followed by activated sludge process plants (40 plants for 0,69 million residents) and plants using biofilter technologies (9 plants for 0,75 million residents). A total of approximately 320 small treatment plants, serving an average of 3 500 residents, use the aerated lagoon treatment. Over the past decade technological developments have resulted in an evolution that will modify the design and operation of wastewater treatment plants in the future: - the more widespread use of techniques developed for the elimination of nitrogen and phosphorus; - the realization of the importance of polluting charges transported by pluvial waters; the beginning of the resultant wastewater treatment plant adaptations; - the limited development of anaerobic treatments that have survived the energy crisis; - the valuable development of biological fixed-culture systems for wastewater treatment and most notably, the biofilters; - the appearance of promising membrane technology in wastewater treatment systems, which could facilitate the definition of new treatment objectives; - the consideration of the global reliability of the wastewater treatment systems instead of only peak performance; - a more integrated vision for the prevention of pollution in industry (clean technologies) as well as in the domestic environment (integrated management of sewerage system and wastewater treatment plant).","Activated sludge; Aerated lagoon; Anaerobic treatment; Biological treatment; Nutrient removal; Wastewater treatment","activated sludge; aeration; biofilter; canada; France; nitrogen; phosphorus; waste water treatment; Activated sludge process; Anaerobic digestion; Biological sewage treatment; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Filters (for fluids); Membranes; Sewage treatment plants; Sewers; Biofilters; Integrated sewerage system management; Membrane technology; Wastewater treatment; activated sludge; nutrient; removal; waste water; water treatment plant; sewage treatment; urban area; wastewater; water management; Canada, Quebec; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031753258

It is important to determine the scope, nature, and content of the message in addition to the delivery of these messages through proper channels. Channels of communication vary in reach and influence, and different segments of the population vary in the capacity to absorb information. Rural people are considered susceptible because of their penchant for continually using injections for treatment of any ailment; the source of concern is unsterilized needles and syringes. The semantics of AIDs is discussed to emphasize the problem of how to identify AIDs among the multiplicity of languages in individual countries. For instance, in Nigeria there may be 150-400 languages, and these languages lack systematically developed metalanguage and specialized vocabularies. The view that local language use must be one way, linear is accepted, and the difficulties surmounted. Local languages may be used to transmit information of a nontechnical nature. The literate minority should have access to detailed information on causes, modes of transmission, symptoms, treatment or management, but not everyone needs this extent of detail. The rural and urban residents should know about the incurability of the disease, the mode of transmission, its symptoms, and what should be done if someone is suspected of having an HIV infection. Already the Hausa of Nigeria have a term for AIDs, Karya-Garkuwa, which suggests a disease that breaks down the mechanism of the biological functioning of the body. Communicators must be knowledgeable and able to effectively transmit facts not myths. Of the 3 modes of transmission (sex, blood, mother to child), sexual transmission is the most important. Blood routes are through transfusions, contaminated blood products for hemophilia patients, contaminated needles and syringes of intravenous drug users, unsterilized needles and syringes used for medical treatment, knives for circumcision or body marking, razor blades in barber shops, and toothbrushes. All media should be used as well as community based informal and political channels. Traditional communication modes in rural areas are required.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines and examine the factors associated with the acceptance in Bangladesh. In between January 30 to February 6, 2021, we conducted a web-based anonymous cross-sectional survey among the Bangladeshi general population. At the start of the survey, there was a detailed consent section that explained the study’s intent, the types of questions we would ask, the anonymity of the study, and the study’s voluntary nature. The survey only continued when a respondent consented, and the answers were provided by the respondents themselves. The multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors that influence the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination. A total of 605 eligible respondents took part in this survey (population size 1630046161 and required sample size 591) with an age range of 18 to 100. A large proportion of the respondents are aged less than 50 (82%) and male (62.15%). The majority of the respondents live in urban areas (60.83%). A total of 61.16% (370/605) of the respondents were willing to accept/take the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the accepted group, only 35.14% showed the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine immediately, while 64.86% would delay the vaccination until they are confirmed about the vaccine’s efficacy and safety or COVID-19 becomes deadlier in Bangladesh. The regression results showed age, gender, location (urban/rural), level of education, income, perceived risk of being infected with COVID-19 in the future, perceived severity of infection, having previous vaccination experience after age 18, having higher knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccination were significantly associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. The research reported a high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine refusal and hesitancy in Bangladesh. To diminish the vaccine hesitancy and increase the uptake, the policymakers need to design a well-researched immunization strategy to remove the vaccination barriers. To improve vaccine acceptance among people, false rumors and misconceptions about the COVID-19 vaccines must be dispelled (especially on the internet) and people must be exposed to the actual scientific facts. © 2021 Mahmud et al.

The behavioral factors of vaccine hesitancy or refusal are a crucial dimension that need to be understood in order to design appropriate interventions. The aim of this study was to explore the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and to provide recommendations to increase the acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh. Methods We employed a Barrier Analysis (BA) approach to examine twelve potential behavioral determinants (drawn from the Health Belief Model [HBM] and Theory of Reasoned Action [TRA]) of intended vaccine acceptance. We conducted 45 interviews with those who intended to take the vaccine (Acceptors) and another 45 interviews with those who did not have that intention (Non-acceptors). We performed data analysis to find statistically significant differences and to identify which beliefs were most highly associated with acceptance and non-acceptance with COVID-19 vaccines. Results The behavioral determinants associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Dhaka included perceived social norms, perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines and trust in them, perceived risk/susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy, perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived action efficacy, perceived severity of COVID-19, access, and perceived divine will. In line with the HBM, beliefs about the disease itself were highly predictive of vaccine acceptance, and some of the strongest statistically-significant (p<0.001) predictors of vaccine acceptance in this population are beliefs around both injunctive and descriptive social norms. Specifically, Acceptors were 3.2 times more likely to say they would be very likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine if a doctor or nurse recommended it, twice as likely to say that most people they know will get a vaccine, and 1.3 times more likely to say that most close family and friends will get a vaccine. The perceived safety of vaccines was found to be important since Non-acceptors were 1.8 times more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are ""not safe at all"". Beliefs about one's risk of getting COVID-19 disease and the severity of it were predictive of being a vaccine acceptor: Acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say that it was very likely that someone in their household would get COVID-19, 1.3 times more likely to say that they were very concerned about getting COVID-19, and 1.3 times more likely to say that it would be very serious if someone in their household contracted COVID- 19. Other responses of Acceptors on what makes immunization easier may be helpful in programming to boost acceptance, such as providing vaccination through government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators maintain proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Conclusion An effective behavior change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will need to address multiple beliefs and behavioral determinants, reducing barriers and leveraging enablers identified in this study.

Design, setting and participants: Cross-sectional, population level national survey of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life longitudinal cohort study (collected 2008–2016). Participants were specialist physicians from four career stage groups: pre-registrars (physician intent); registrars; new consultants (< 5 years since Fellowship); and consultants. Main outcome measures: Level of professional satisfaction across various job aspects, such as hours worked, working conditions, support networks and educational opportunities, comparing rural and metropolitan based physicians. Results: Participants included 1587 pre-registrars (15% rural), 1745 physician registrars (9% rural), 421 new consultants (20% rural) and 1143 consultants (13% rural). Rural physicians of all career stages demonstrated equivalent professional satisfaction across most job aspects, compared with metropolitan physician counterparts. Some examples of differences in satisfaction included rural pre-registrars being less likely to agree they had good access to support and supervision from qualified consultants (odds ratio [OR], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9) and rural consultants being more likely to agree they had a poorer professional support network (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2–2.9). In terms of demographics, relatively more rural physicians had a rural background or were trained overseas. Although most junior physicians were women, female consultants were less likely to be working in a rural location (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4–0.8). Conclusion: Junior physicians in metropolitan or rural settings have a similar professional experience, which is important in attracting future trainees. Increased opportunities for rural training should be prioritised, along with addressing concerns about the professional isolation and poorer support network of those in rural areas, not only among junior doctors but also consultants. Finally, making rural practice more attractive to female junior physicians could greatly improve the consultant physician distribution. Chapter 2: General physicians and paediatricians in rural Australia: the social construction of professional identity: Objective: To explore the construction of professional identity among general physicians and paediatricians working in non-metropolitan areas. Design, setting and participants: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with general physicians and paediatricians, plus informants from specialist colleges, government agencies and academia who were involved in policy and programs for the training and recruitment of specialists in rural locations across three states and two territories. This research is part of the Training Pathways and Professional Support for Building a Rural Physician Workforce Study, 2018–19. Main outcome measures: Individual and collective descriptors of professional identity. Results: We interviewed 36 key informants. Professional identity for general physicians and paediatricians working in regional, rural and remote Australia is grounded in the breadth of their training, but qualified by location — geographic location, population served or specific location, where social and cultural context specifically shapes practice. General physicians and paediatricians were deeply engaged with their local community and its economic vulnerability, and they described the population size and dynamics of local economies as determinants of viable practice. They often complemented their practice with formal or informal training in areas of special interest, but balanced their practice against subspecialist availability, also dependent on demographics. While valuing their professional roles, they showed limited inclination for industrial organisation. Conclusion: Despite limited consensus on identity descriptors, rural general physicians and paediatricians highly value generalism and their rural engagement. The structural and geographic bias that preferences urban areas will need to be addressed to further develop coordinated strategies for advanced training in rural contexts, for which collective identity is integral. Chapter 3: Sustainable rural physician training: leadership in a fragile environment: Objectives: To understand Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) training contexts, including supervisor and trainee perspectives, and to identify contributors to the sustainability of training sites, including training quality. Design, setting and participants: A cross-sectional mixed-methods design was used. A national sample of RACP trainees and Fellows completed online surveys. Survey respondents who indicated willingness to participate in interviews were purposively recruited to cover perspectives from a range of geographic, demographic and training context parameters. Main outcome measures: Fellows’ and trainees’ work and life satisfaction, and their experiences of supervision and training, respectively, by geographic location. Results: Fellows and trainees reported high levels of satisfaction, with one exception — inner regional Fellows reported lower satisfaction regarding opportunities to use their abilities. Not having a good support network was associated with lower satisfaction. Our qualitative findings indicate that a culture of undermining rural practice is prevalent and that good leadership at all levels is important to reduce negative impacts on supervisor and trainee availability, site accreditation and viability. Trainees described challenges in navigating training pathways, ensuring career development, and having the flexibility to meet family needs. The small number of Fellows in some sites poses challenges for supervisors and trainees and results in a blurring of roles; accreditation is an obstacle to provision of training at rural sites; and the overlap between service and training roles can be difficult for supervisors. Conclusion: Our qualitative findings emphasise the distinctive nature of regional specialist training, which can make it a fragile environment. Leadership at all levels is critical to sustaining accreditation and support for supervisors and trainees. Chapter 4: Principles to guide training and professional support for a sustainable rural specialist physician workforce: Objective: To draw on research conducted in the Building a Rural Physician Workforce project, the first national study on rural specialist physicians, to define a set of principles applicable to guiding training and professional support action. Design: We used elements of the Delphi approach for systematic data collection and codesign, and applied a hybrid participatory action planning approach to achieve consensus on a set of principles. Results: Eight interconnected foundational principles built around rural regions and rural people were identified: FP1, grow your own “connected to” place; FP2, select trainees invested in rural practice; FP3, ground training in community need; FP4, rural immersion — not exposure; FP5, optimise and invest in general medicine; FP6, include service and academic learning components; FP7, join up the steps in rural training; and FP8, plan sustainable specialist roles. Conclusion: These eight principles can guide training and professional support to build a sustainable rural physician workforce. Application of the principles, and coordinated action by stakeholders and the responsible organisations, are needed at national, state and local levels to achieve a sustainable rural physician workforce. © 2021 AMPCo Pty Ltd","Accreditation; Delivery of healthcare; Delivery of healthcare; Education; Health planning; Healthcare disparities; Medical colleges; professional; Rural health services","accreditation; adult; article; Australia; career; cohort analysis; consultation; controlled study; Delphi study; demography; economic aspect; female; general practitioner; government; health care delivery; health care disparity; human; immersion; industry; leadership; learning; life satisfaction; medical school; outcome assessment; pediatrician; population size; rural area; rural health care; rural population; urban area; work environment; workforce; decision making; general practitioner; medical education; medical staff; medicine; patient referral; physician; Australia; Career Choice; Education, Medical, Continuing; General Practitioners; Humans; Leadership; Medical Staff, Hospital; Medicine; Pediatricians; Physicians; Referral and Consultation; Rural Health Services; Workforce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109083004

As the prevalence of older adults with disability increases, it is important that urban parks are accessible to this population so that they too might gain health benefits. There is limited literature investigating the experiences of urban parks by older adults with disability. This qualitative study, set in a region of New Zealand, explored the experiences, including accessibility, of urban parks by 17 older adults (55 years and older) with self-reported disabilities. Three focus groups (n = 4, 5 and 4 people) and four individual interviews were undertaken. Data were analyzed using the General Inductive Approach. Two primary themes of “Enticing” and “Park use considerations” are presented. Urban parks and green spaces are perceived to provide an environment for older adults with a disability to improve their physical, psychosocial and spiritual health, and social connectedness. Parks that are not age, ability or culture diverse are uninviting and exclusive. Meaningful collaboration between park designers, city councils and people with disability is required to maximize the public health benefits of parks and make parks inviting and accessible for users of all ages, cultures and abilities. Park co-design with people with disability may provide one means of improving accessibility and park usability and thus park participation by older adults with disability. © 2021 by the authors.

Many people attribute this to rapid development in globalization and the adoption of Western standardization in planning and design practice. Conversely, in the field of architectural sociology, scholars argue that socio-cultural factors such as privacy, gender segregation, and hospitality are the important variables for determining the spatial form of Islamic residential architecture. This research study aims to investigate the degree to which the shaping of the spatial form in a sample of Qatari vernacular courtyard houses embeds socio-cultural factors based on morphological analysis of human behavior and activities in domestic space. The study utilizes space syntax analysis to explore the spatial connectivity of four Qatari vernacular courtyard houses related to domestic functions as a realization of inhabitants' system of activities and a manifestation of culture as a way of life. The study's findings shed light on the spatial formation of Qatari vernacular courtyard houses as a realization of socio-cultural imperatives, thus reflecting the essence of societal formation in the domestic architecture of old Qatari settlements. The insights from this research study can help to contribute to a cultural heritage-framework for the preservation of distinctive Qatari Vernacular Residential Architecture based on the analytical criteria of housing spatial form, socio-cultural factors, and the interrelation between both. © 2020 by the authors.","Architectural identity; Courtyard; Cultural heritage; Domestic space; House form; Space syntax","connectivity; cultural heritage; globalization; hospitality industry; human behavior; residential location; standardization; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf; Qatar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091553703

Each method was stratified by age (25–45 year, 46–65 year and ≥ 65 year) and ethnic group (first nations or not). About 600 preparations and single‐ingredient foods were identified that differed both in frequency and variety by region.

With the issues such as environmental pollution triggering climate change and consumption of natural resources, the search for solutions to the growing problems of cities with their inadequacies in demographic and spatial planning decisions increases its importance day by day. Therefore, in recent years, the city has become one of the prominent subjects in scientific studies due to its importance. Derived from the concept of city; the concept of urbanization, which includes the adaptation process and the effort to be included in the system, is one of the main arguments of the city and urban space. The phenomenon of urbanization included the quality of the adaptation process by becoming a concept about the emotions, thoughts and behaviors of individuals trying to live in the city completely from the physical definition of urbanization. Cities have been diversified with the migrants they receive, with the views and habits of different sociocultural individuals, their dissimilar life philosophies and various spatial planes that enable them to coexist with harmony and harmony in social life. The concept of 'sustainable city' has emerged as a new urban design model due to the increasing pressure on the rapidly growing city horizontally and vertically with the increasing population and technological developments. In cities designed with this perspective; both spatial sustainability, which minimizes negative impacts on nature and transfers natural resources to future generations, as well as many spatial planes that diversify the daily social life of the city's inhabitants and support social sustainability. Based on the conceptual development and transformation of the concept of the city, the study aims to reveal the contribution of the development or restructuring of ' public spaces', one of the important urban spaces supporting the spatial and social sustainability of urban development, to urban planning Public spaces have become a rapid and powerful momentum for urbanism and architecture with their social and spatial benefits as the areas of integration and interaction for the urban population in the rapidly increasing urban population. Public spaces that constitute the essence and centers of gravity of the city; are the elements that give identity to the city both historically and geographically. One of the main objectives of sustainable urban policies is to transform people from different parts of the city into an integrated structure together with public spaces, which is a meeting place where individuals from different socio-cultural and economic groups participate. This study predicts the value of the spatial plane in which public spaces, which are important planning tools of sustainable urban development, act as an important catalyst and will add to the urban social life as a center of interaction and integration. In the study, sustainable urban design public spaces; examining the city's history, culture, silhouette, local economic vitality, social interaction area as well as its contribution to the city is described and discussed. © 2020, Milli Folklor Dergisi.

The fortress grows out of the urban-renewal movement of the post-World War II era, particularly on American university campuses. This architecture pre-empts threat by clamping down and fortifying its peripheral walls while controlling, surveilling, and limiting the number of entrances. Lockdown procedures, encouraging surveillance among citizens, metal detectors, increased police presences, and data-mining are all tactics at the fortress’ disposal. The alternative, much newer approach pre-empts threat by surveilling flow; that is, inviting people inside the structure and encouraging traffic while relying on more remote and less obvious tactics for detecting undesirables, such as closed-circuit television (CCTV), data-mining, and, like the fortress model, encouraging peer surveillance. Surveilled flow maintains the gesture of openness; however, this is mainly aesthetic, as other methods of intrusive policing take place at less-visible levels. At the heart of both of these articulations of pre-emptive threat culture is the digital-age anxiety about the alignment and possible misalignment between visual and information-based citizen profiles: Does the student or visitor appear to be a threat? Does his or her online behavior indicate potential threat? The profusion of information in the digital age meets this more primal desire to commensurate the appearance of risk with other forms of information-based evidence of threat. Digital-era concerns about how to interpret a wealth of information at various institutional and cultural levels pervade the riskscape in the developed world, and educational architecture is but one manifestation. © The author(s), 2019.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073474620

The purpose of this paper is to examine the challenges of bidding for this scheme. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with bid team members from four out of the five short-listed cities for the 2021 award. Respondents were situated across the country and, at the time, finalising their Stage 2 bids. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the responses. Findings: The UKCoC scheme is a top-down scheme which is delivered “in place”. The danger of the top-down vision is that local people cannot often conceptualise what it might mean within the context of their own locality. The findings here suggest that bid team members are attempting to do this despite obvious time pressures. The research presented here suggests that cities are reconciling the top-down, criteria-led nature of the scheme with a real reflection on how to make that work for their locality which is distinctive. Social implications: The UKCoC scheme has proved to galvanise communities to reflect on the nature of their places and think about what makes them unique in comparison to the other bidding cities. The bidding teams acknowledge the challenges of bidding but there is a sense that competing is worth the investment. Originality/value: This paper offers a unique insight into a recent competitive placemaking scheme and reflects on how placemaking can potentially be reconciled as both top-down and place-based. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bidding; City of culture; Competition; Placemaking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053031567

Traditional markets are places which show the community lifestyle, culture and heritage that's why it has a strong rootedness to its local people. By relating space to culture, a relationship between historic and contemporary design decisions can be achieved. Most of the Arabian Cities are undergoing continuous development through different qualities of expression in terms of economy, culture, and global outlook in the old cities 'centres. Nowadays sustainable development has become an essential intervention in the capital cities. However, sustainable solutions should not concern themselves only with utilizing technology, but also with respecting a community's social, cultural, historical, and environmental aspects. Traditional souqs (market places) are centralized as an iconic inherits in the historic old quarter of the city. The research problem arises from that some of the current traditional markets in the Arab region do not promote social cohesion as they have been developed without consideration for local identity and lifestyle. The question then becomes how to maintain the relationship between the spatial, social and environmental aspects in renovating traditional markets. The importance of the research is derived from the need of applying a critical study for traditional markets' architecture with pre-existing cultural values. The aim is to reach appropriate sustainable solutions that facilitate the integration of socio-bioclimatic requirements, qualities of the spaces, and culture identity in developing sustainable traditional markets. This study examines and employs a descriptive qualitative and quantitative research strategies for one of the oldest traditional markets in Riyadh's city old center ""Al-zall souq"", to explore the impact of change in the old center, through deriving a typological formation analytical framework which asses; morphological language, socio-cultural and bioclimatic aspects.

Urban planning should concentrate on an organic relationship between people and their living spaces. The city is a product of Earth, a fact of nature, man’s method of expression, Mumford writes in his The Culture of Cities (first edition in 1938). This also means that both the designer and the user must have a high degree of creativity in order to design and utilise the built environment. By analysing the definition of the city Mumford examines its changes during history from ancient times to recent planning method. He criticises the most dominant design processes of the 20th century: the functionalist and mechanical urban design. He is an advocate of the organic method in planning and understanding cities. The organic approach requires an active and creative approach as opposed to mere passive reception. This organic approach by Mumford to understanding cities is based on the theory of Kevin A. Lynch. We may distinguish 3 normative ways of city planning theory: (1) the cosmic, (2) the mechanic and (3) the organic model. In my paper I will first apply the onion model of culture developed by Geert Hofstede for the city and its analysis, and also for the appearance of creativity in them. After that I am going to examine the city with a special, architectural based mind map theory: the five elements by Lynch. Lynch suggests that these five elements (paths, edges, districts, nodes, landmarks) create the mental map for readability. Finally, I will investigate a usage of mental map in modern city planning (Le Corbusier) and works on the process of “debabelisation” (Otto Neurath). © 2018 The Author(s).","City planning; Creativity; Hofstede; Lynch; Mental map; Urban design; Visual argumentation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058706819

Method: The method of the study is a survey with a questionnaire; subjects are physically disabled people living at home in rural and urban areas in Korea. The Functional Independence Measure was used to measure changes in subjects’ levels of independence. Results: It was expected that if homes were renovated according to individual needs, disabled people’s independence level would be increased by one or more level compared to their current daily independence level in their existing homes. In particular, independence levels concerning bathing and locomotion, which are low in existing conditions, were expected to increase significantly with renovation. Such effects on independence level were conspicuous for disabled people in rural area. Conclusion: The results prove the positive effects of home renovations of disabled people’s independence, thus providing meaningful academic evidence on home renovations for disabled people. Implication for rehabilitation Korea had a culture where support measures to aid the life independence of disabled persons relied heavily on human services, leading to a lack of diversity in support measures. By closing the gap between the resident’s disability and the inadequacy in their prevailing environment, house remodeling can be a crucial intervention for improving the independence of disabled persons in their daily lives. Depending on the nature of their disabilities and their residential arrangements, disabled persons have diverse needs regarding home remodeling. Implementing home remodeling in such a manner that suits the resident’s needs is crucial to boosting their independence. Because of this, remodeling personnel must interact with residents prior to the renovation while also strengthening their expertise. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","home renovation; Independent living; physically disabled people","aged; construction work and architectural phenomena; daily life activity; disabled person; environmental planning; female; furniture; housekeeping; human; independent living; male; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; rehabilitation; rural population; self care; South Korea; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Architectural Accessibility; Disabled Persons; Environment Design; Female; Housekeeping; Humans; Independent Living; Interior Design and Furnishings; Male; Republic of Korea; Rural Population; Self Care; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020257593

It is usually evaluated based on how loud the urban environment is. However, this approach does not consider people's perception of the urban acoustic environment. Therefore, a different method has been developed based on the perception of the acoustic environment using the concept of soundscape. Soundscape is defined as the acoustic environment perceived by people who are part of the environment. This approach considers the relationship between the sound source, the environment, and the people. The analysis of soundscape considers many aspects such as cultural aspects, people's expectations, people's experience of space, and social aspects. Soundscape affects many aspects of human life such as culture, health, and the quality of life. Urban soundscape management and planning must be integrated with the other aspect of urban design, both in the design and the improvement stages. The soundscape concept seeks to make the acoustic environment as pleasant as possible in a space with or without uncomfortable sound sources. Soundscape planning includes the design of physical features to achieve a positive perceptual outcome. It is vital to gather data regarding the relationship between humans and the components of a soundscape, e.g., sound sources, features of the physical environment, the functions of a space, and the expectation of the sound source. The data can be measured and gathered using several soundscape evaluation methods. Soundscape evaluation is usually conducted using in-situ surveys and laboratory experiments using a multi-speaker system. Although these methods have been validated and are widely used in soundscape analysis, there are some limitations in the application. The in-situ survey needs to be done at one time with many people at the same time because it is hard to replicate the acoustic environment. Conversely, the laboratory experiment does not have a problem with the repetition of the experiment. This method requires a room with a multi-speaker reproduction system. This project used a different method to analyse soundscape developed using headphones via the internet. The internet system for data gathering has been established; a website has enabled to reproduce high-quality audio and it has a system to design online questionnaires. Furthermore, the development of a virtual reality system allows the reproduction of virtual audio-visual stimulus on a website. Although the website has an established system to gather the required data, the problem is the validation of the reproduction system for soundscape analysis, which needs to be done with consideration of several factors: the suitable recording system, the effect of headphone variation, the calibration of the system, and the perception result from internet-based acoustic environment reproduction. This study aims to develop and validate a web-based urban soundscape evaluation method. By using this method, the experiment can be repeated easily and data can be gathered from many respondents. Furthermore, the simplicity of the system allows for the application by the stakeholders in urban design. The data gathered from this system is important for the design of an urban area with consideration of the acoustic aspects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economic and social effects; Loudspeakers; Social aspects; Surveys; Urban planning; Virtual reality; Acoustic environment; Audio-visual stimulus; Laboratory experiments; Online questionnaire; Physical environments; Uncomfortable sounds; Urban environments; Virtual reality system; Websites",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048435772

It is proposed that the sonic considerations which have been made in urban design are commonly developed within an assumption of otologically normal hearing, and, more broadly, without the acknowledgement of the actual diversity in people's auditory and sensory abilities. Existing considerations of sound and hearing within inclusive design research, particularly in the built environment, are grounded in an 'auraltypical' perspective where the primary focus is hearing individuals or those with hearing loss. This position supposes to some degree that an idealized otological profi le and consistent model of hearing profi ciency is shared amongst all citizens and engenders a culture of urban design driven by 'good/bad' ears and homogenized sonic interaction. This paper introduces the theoretical paradigm of 'auraldiversity' - an emerging agenda that acknowledges the diversity of human hearing and the multitude of elements that place the hearing modality within a state of constant fl ux. The paper situates this theoretical perspective within the context of the built environment through the mapping of three 'auraldivergent' hearing profi les. Each profi le charts the lived sonic experiences of a d/Deaf or disabled individual in the built environment. The paper concludes by positioning the auraldiversity paradigm as a catalyst in the development of a hearing-centred approach to inclusive design research, a new agenda where the opportunity for more socially and sonically equitable design of the built environment is established. © 2018 Ingenta.",,"design; sensory system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044765574

Design/methodology/approach: The experience of a place may become an integral part of a product experience. The enhancement of products (Splendiani, 2013): assumes a meaning which goes beyond the simple sale of material goods. It covers the supply of complex experiences … enriched by intangible elements capable to stimulate and involve the sensory and experiential component of consumption. It deals with attracting people to the places where local products are made by inserting the products in the most extensive offers covering the entire territorial system of reference The experience may also be used for the spectacolarisation of a place and its commercialisation, as in the case of “brandscapes” (Klingman, 2007). In this case, it is important not to clone every place everywhere because they could inevitably resemble each other without be able to really engage the people who move into them (Lehtovuori, 2010). The methodology approach is based on a wide bibliography and internet research based on the main terms connected to the topics of the paper, including experience, place identity, quality product, regeneration; on case studies – even though not illustrated – concerning places of interest for the research topics, such as: Hafencity in Hamburg, the Albert Dock in Liverpool, Abondaibarra area in Bilbao. Findings: The planning of places of quality product cannot be separated from interpretation of the territory as a cultural system resulting from an ensemble of historical, economic and social processes. In such a system, the contribution of the cultural factor must be considered propulsive, not only for its qualitative meaning but also, and especially, for the role of “trait d’union” of a number of actions taken to protect and enhance places.

The project aims to protect urban sounds as intangible cultural heritage elements and turn the action of protecting sounds into a collaborative work. Sounds are of great significance in daily urban life and in culture as they carry emotions and awaken cultural memories. Thus, they deserve to be protected and transferred to next generations. In this paper, we first evaluate soundscapes as an intangible cultural heritage element, second we explore the presentation techniques in soundscape studies in the literature, then we explain how the methods implemented step by step, and finally we introduce the two outcomes: The library archive (The Soundscape of Istanbul project) and the crowdsourced web archive (The Soundsslike project). The Soundscape of Istanbul project aims to collect and archive cultural and urban sounds of the city while The Soundsslike project is basically a crowdsourced online sound archive which invites people to record symbolic urban sounds and upload them to the online sound archive. This online platform was built and displayed in an exhibition by means of an interactive tabletop interface to learn more from users and contributors, and to enrich the archive content by raising public awareness of urban sounds.","Cultural heritage data; Design thinking; Digital culture; Human heritage interaction; Open archive; Participatory culture.; Social networks and munities in cultural heritage; Sound archive visualization; Sustainability","Computer games; Data visualization; Sustainable development; User interfaces; Cultural heritages; Design thinking; Digital culture; Human heritage interaction; Open archives; Sound archives; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997159434

Might it be possible to see Mumford, especially in his writings of the 1930s, as an early exemplar of green urbanism? Within environmental history, Mumford has been treated mostly as a regionalist - sometimes even as an opponent of the city. This essay argues that in fact his path toward ecological ""balance"" led directly through the city, not out of it. Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic ""renewal"" but also as a landscape full of what he called ""remnants"" and ""persistents""; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. © 2016 The Author.",,"environmental history; material culture; modernity; momentum; sustainability; urban design; urban ecosystem; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992331731

They are leading examples of a new restoration design approach that is squarely placed at the interface of nature and culture. This multidisciplinary paradigm bridges the gap between an ecological approach preoccupied with returning damaged landscapes to an imagined original state and a landscape design approach concerned with creating a place for people to reinhabit. Environmental Restoration and Design for Recreation and Ecotourism is the first book to provide a detailed examination of the entire process of restoring damaged or abandoned landscapes to benefit both nature and people, specifically for the purposes of recreation and ecotourism. With a focus on history, planning, methodology, design, and construction, it explores five case studies of successful regenerative landscape design projects and gives readers an inside look at the evolution of design projects. Two of the cases offer a particularly comprehensive review of award-winning projects: the reparation of the degraded Las Vegas Wash into Clark County Wetlands Park and the transformation of the abandoned Barn Elms Reservoirs into the London Wetland Centre. Supported by extensive photographs, tables, maps, sketches, and schematics, these case studies trace how ideas are first conceived and then adopted, transformed, or even abandoned along the way. Each case study also includes a questions-and-answers discussion with designers and managers. Emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary cooperation, the book presents lessons learned from some of the most innovative projects in regenerative landscape design. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, recently, most of the walls have been torn down in the process of fast urbanization and old city renewal. The purpose of this paper is to focus on people’s cognition and evaluation of urban memory during this pull-down-and-preserve process. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 380 participants was investigated on a number of issues using questionnaires, including memory case reminders (stability, variability, temporality), emotional bonding with memory case (identity, dependence, authenticity), and socio-demographic variables (age, education, life experience, length of residence). The urban memory cognition model and attitude evaluation value model which were based on Likert scale were used to process the collected data. Findings – In the three aspects of memory case reminders, stability and temporary elements can be most cognized, whereas variability elements are more difficult due to their change over time. As for emotional bonding with memory case, people show a high level of identification with the walls; the walls’ memory being passed down could enhance people’s memory when mentioning Beijing. Further, higher education groups consider the walls’ authenticity to be most important and are unwilling to accept the outcome of walls-ruins parks; older adults have tolerant attitudes to the ruins parks. Originality/value – This study could not only contribute to the excavation of urban memory, but also strengthen citizens’ sense of identity and cohesiveness, thus shaping the spirit and culture of the city. Some findings could provide applicable guidelines for urban heritage protection and contribute a new perspective on the interrelationship between people and their physical surroundings. © 2016, © International Tourism Studies Association.","Beijing city walls; Cognition and evaluation; Emotional bonding; Evaluation; Historic architecture; Urban memory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013272805

Informed by interaction design and urban studies, this project examines and visualizes the sociocultural networks shaping immigrant communities and how local neighborhoods negotiate a sense of place within an increasingly globalized space. Geographer Doreen Massey recognizes space not as a static entity but as the product of interrelations from the immensity of the global to the intimately tiny. These interrelations are part of a story, an interpreted history that changes and develops over time. One could recognize cultural heritage in a similar way-as dynamic and part of a narrative trajectory that is not merely frozen in a romanticized or essentialist past. Much of what constitutes the dynamics of ethnic community formation is intangible as it is largely a lived experience rather than one that is necessarily documented or archived. As such, this project serves as a digital archive and platform for community storytelling that enriches our understanding of the city and the often intangible narratives that create a sense of place. Currently, Los Angeles has the largest population of Koreans in the United States living outside of Korea. Nicknamed the 'L.A. district of Seoul City', most visitors understand Koreatown as an extension of Seoul. But, what most people may not know is that the majority of inhabitants who comprise its residential and working class population are not Korean, but Latino. The everyday space of this community is inhabited by a mix of immigrants coming from Mexico, Central and South America, and other parts of Asia including Bangladesh. These networks of nationalisms converge in the urban space of Koreatown. This contests predominant conceptions of ethnic enclaves being understood as homogenous and makes us re-imagine what we think we understand about them-they are increasingly becoming polycentric in complex ways. Combining design, documentary and issues in contemporary media studies including global/local relations, ethnic and urban studies, this work uses new media and mapping to create greater awareness of our built environment and the peoples who populate it. Mapping is a dynamic system that changes according to the shifts in culture and community that characterize any geographic place. How can this system be visualized in order to read a space with newly informed imaginations? What kind of urban interfaces could be designed to communicate with the spaces we move through and what overlooked stories could be uncovered in order to enrich our understanding of cities and the intangible cultural histories embedded in them?

The Eco-city has emerged as an urban modernization concept that attempts to reframe urban development for sustainable outcomes, yet there have been several alterations and coining of new terminologies to describe an eco-city, mainly based of concepts and the design methodology and/or the purpose the city is to serve. Even though the eco-city concept and development profess to have some basic principles - dogma - mostly based on urban sustainability, the rapid changes in terminology in recent times calls the attention of many policy makers, investors, development promoters and stakeholders, as well as researchers alike. Beyond these corporate borders, are also the culture (people) and the environment that are influenced by (and interacts with) the eco-city. However, there is no widely accepted framework for assessing Eco-cities. Besides, the methods and outcomes of Eco-cities; and how these outcomes can be evaluated to determine the performance of Eco-cites remain unresolved. This paper presents a framework for assessing the performance of Eco-cities. It argues that due to the inherent differences in the culture, topography, climate, economy, infrastructural base, and technological advancement etc. of cities around the world, Eco-cities may embody distinct characteristics in the way they are understood and applied in different regions. Nonetheless, using a common benchmark across geographical regions, one can do performance assessment of Eco-cities, which can be basis for replication, accessibility, as well as serve as goal metrics. © 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

In this chapter I consider gardens and the opportunities for learning they afford from an expansive view of culture, learning and socio-historical practice. At their core, gardens are broadly about the cultivation of plants and land, however, gardening reflects complex variations, goals, and values affording various forms of identity and meaning. Indeed throughout history human communities have cultivated and harvested plants for food, for medicine, for aesthetics, for material resources, and much more. The specifics of these practices have evolved and shifted over time and varied across cultural communities, however, regardless of their specific form gardening practices are foundational reflective of the relations between humans and the natural world. The rise of learning gardens is perhaps a resilient response and remembering given the erosion of people from land that has emerged in the technologically saturated twentieth century. Given this expanded view of gardens in human communities and the present socio-historical dynamics, what might the possibilities for learning gardens be? What opportunities for learning do learning gardens afford? What are the variations in learning gardens? How do the particulars of gardens (their design, their goals, the plants grown, the programs and practices associated with them) impact learning? Largely, the answers to these questions are unknown or under-explored. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988596336

Harvard Business School Press, 2004a)]. Communities of connected, informed, empowered, and active consumers are challenging the world. According to Nijs (Imagineering the butterfly effect, transformation by inspiration. 11 International Publishing, 2014), “growing connectivity, interdependency, diversity and interactivity has major influences on the way we can create value in society.” Instead of passive users, today’s consumers want to be involved in designing processes. As Hargadon and Bechky argue (Organization Science 17:484–500, 2006), “collective consumer creativity is qualitatively distinct from individual consumer creativity—it occurs when social interactions trigger new interpretations and new discoveries that consumers thinking alone, could not have generated. If we realize that creativity is a systemic—as opposed to individual process, then we are led to broaden our perspective”. Already in 1958 Jacobs approached cities as living beings and ecosystems, unfolding the transformation of the urban environment and the regional development potential, especially for tourism and culture. She suggested that over time, buildings, streets and neighbourhoods function as dynamic organisms, changing in response to how people interact with them. This sentiment is now, more than ever, echoing into the tourism sector evolvement as such and its meaningful interpretation with and for all. How can we encourage innovation and how can we engage customers and participants in creating the future in order to satisfy the needs of the participants? Why is Co-Creating the future for all of us? How can we design (for) the future in order to ignite interaction? According to Tonder (Journal of Industrial Psychology 30(3):53–64, 2004) the new society is characterized predominantly by consumption where people create a sense of who they are through what they consume. Simply stated, consumers from a century ago were concerned about the utility value (does it solve my problem?) whereas today’s consumers focuses on the intangibles—cultural or symbolic—values (does it promote my identity?). This becomes valid for the tourism sector and especially the cultural one, whereas the entrepreneurial learning has become the collective learning and the exchange and co-creation of value, which leads to the introduction and increase of relevance of communities of practice. The current chapter aims to study the cross-border cultural tourism development of Bulgaria and Romania as a thriving possibility for entrepreneurial learning and communities of practice. It will unfold the existing potential of these countries and look into the specifics of how the complex nature of contemporary society is affecting the transformational essence of exchange versus value co-creation. The further objectives of this chapter are to analyze the value and elaborate on a model of entrepreneurial learning and community of practice establishment in the cross-border region of two economies in transition—the Bulgarian and the Romanian. These countries will be analyzed through the lens of cultural tourism by looking at the complexity and the value creation interaction possibilities that are enhanced by the entrepreneurial and community development. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978254083

The design potential of this project is to look through the entire master plan of the waterfront and then move into the micro elements that support the entire scheme. The master plan plays a crucial role in supporting the waterfront with various types of activities that serve various demographics of users. The redevelopment of the new cruise terminal would also be explored thoroughly in conjunction with Penang Structure Plan in order to come out with the design that could cope with future development.

Pafos is a town with monuments of unique value from every period of its rich cultural tradition where ancient amphitheaters, agoras, and archeological sites co-exist in harmony with the unique Mediterranean seashore and the sensitive natural ecosystem of the Akamas peninsula. Pafos as European Capital of Culture for 2017 aims at developing a strategic sustainable plan to reinvent the town as a cultural landscape used as a tourist development tool. It will implement an extensive urban landscape design intervention plan, with the aim of restoring open public spaces, creating links between important sites and archaeological spaces, and recovering the lost connection with the natural environment, the land and the sea based on aspects of sustainable and eco-friendly tourism development. Such a landscape approach tempts to integrate natural and cultural heritage by recognizing that the current landscape is the product of long-term and complex interrelationships between people and the environment. This research may also serve as a basis for future strategic landscape interventions in the urban fabric as a tourism policy and cultural heritage planning establishing an exclusive linkage to the ""sense of place"" and landscape design.",,"Ecology; Land reclamation; Stream flow; Sustainable development; Archeological sites; Cultural dimensions; Cultural heritages; Cultural traditions; Landscape restoration; Natural environments; Sustainable tourism; Tourism development; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954178919

However, mapping them out is valuable, because permanently sustainable development is the essence of the relationship between man and land. In the early agrarian age, the layout of rural areas was guided by people's aesthetic views of ecology rather than modern precise statistics, calculations, and related design principles. The inherited philosophy of respecting the natural landscape is the original driving force for preserving aesthetic spaces. Ancient feng shui landforms should be preserved in China. These non-utilitarian elements carried villagers' natural aesthetic philosophy across generations and captured the meaning of continuous development of the man-land relationship. At present, rural research focuses on the economics of land use. Research on the ecological landscape construction of rural aesthetic spaces is limited, and this needs to be investigated as an important topic in the field. As rural landscapes evolve, human agricultural activities leave an imprint on the aesthetics of ecological spaces, and modern layout patterns result in an inversion of the rural landscape. In recent years, the destruction of the regional geographical structure by the rapid development of modern urbanization has been devastating.My research aims to analyze rural ecological landscapes and aesthetic spaces corresponding to the elements, and how aesthetic spaces are constructed based on geographical frames. I will carry out a multi-scale study of morphological characteristics, landscape space, and the relationship between evolution patterns and response mechanisms. In large-scale landscape areas, preserving the spatial relationship between villages and geographic landscapes is particularly essential if villages are to inherit cultural and historical traditions. Town regions are medium-scale landscape areas. Based on the investigation of geographic elements such as mountain ranges and water systems, the principle of ecological art composition requires villages and fields to consider distribution contrast and plan the height, scale, and density of rural construction, road linearity and strength, and other urban construction indexes from the perspective of ecological aesthetics. Small-scale areas usually adopt aesthetic space composition with architectural design methods, which should consider natural aesthetic philosophy, interior and exterior spaces, and rural social factors. The combination of geography and urban planning that shapes spaces and the connotation of space far exceeds social relationships when determining the development scale and construction layout of rural areas. The priority is to maintain harmony in the social space. The construction of rural aesthetic space operates through the ""hardware"" of the geographical landscape and the ""software"" of cultural inheritance and accumulation with respect to landscape forms, mechanisms, functional structures, and so on. Rural landscape planning must use geography as its basic space structure, base itself on regional geographical space analysis and landscape preservation, and place importance on indexes of preservation of the regional landscape and traditional culture. It should be specified that the requirements of landscape optimization and socioeconomic development are embedded in the requirements of ecological civilization and social development in the layout of landscape space. These elements form a landscape network that can maintain the comprehensive environment. The philosophy of landscape aesthetics should be expanded to broader spaces in order to introduce the concept of landscape beauty to towns, villages, and even farmlands. © 2014, Ecological Society of China.

Self-guided routes and trails are found in both urban and rural contexts and provide an interpreted, themed journey which can be travelled on foot, by bicycle, horseback, car, or in some cases even followed underwater. Trails can vary in scale from the very local, forexample a town trail, to the international, exemplified by the Council of Europe Cultural Routes project which has developed a number of long-distance, cross-border routes interpreting pan-European themes. Timothy and Boyd (2003: 51) have categorised trails as linear visitor attractions that can be mega (international), large (national and regional), or small (local), and note that the mega and large-scale trails are predominantly rural whilst smaller trails are almost always urban based. The idea of travelling along a pre-determined route is not a new one. Indeed, trails may have been amongst the earliest artefacts produced by humans as a means of understanding their world as they found their way through it. Historically, the act of moving through the environment created cognitive connections and knowledge of place as well as producing a physical pathway (Turnbull 2007: 142), and these remain important aspects of trails today. Trails have a rich symbolism as many cultures have origin myths where the creator passes through empty space, according it meaning as they travel (Snead 2009). The path is often representative of the journey through life itself as exemplified in literature from John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress (1678), to Jack Kerouac’s On the Road (1957). In cultural terms, the trail is often characterised as liminal space, full of possibility and used as a setting for chance meetings or farewells in novels, poems and films (Snead 2009). In the contemporary tourism destination, trails are developed to interpret a variety of stories ranging from local history (San Francisco’s Gold Rush Trail, USA), industry (Ruhr Industrial Heritage Trail, Germany), food and wine (South African Wine Trail), to famous people (the Mozart Route) and historical events (the Pendle Witch Trail in Lancashire, UK). Trails are usually developed in partnerships, with local authorities taking the lead in trail development in the UK (Hayes and MacLeod 2008). The range of stakeholders involved typically includes tourism organisations, visitor attractions, civic societies, local history groups and businesses who will benefit from the additional visitor footfall. By their nature, trails form business clusters that should encourage interaction and community participation and this potential has recently been investigated by the Council of Europe in their report on the impact of European Cultural routes on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Council of Europe 2011). Trails have proved to be highly flexible in both the themes that they interpret and in the purposes to which they are put. In recent years, trails have been developed for conservation purposes, routing visitors away from sensitive sites, providing information on environmental issues and encouraging the use of public transport. Their potential as tools for economic development has been recognised (Strauss and Lord 2001; Bowker et al. 2007) and they can provide opportunities for the wider use of local facilities by visitors, enhancing their engagement with place. As al-Hagla (2010: 2) states, ‘ a heritage trail is one physical manifestation of the interactions between tourists, locals, and the host place’. Clearly visitor management and educational rationales are signi?cant and the physical benefits of walking or cycling are promoted through trail use, with some trails having been speci?cally developed to address health issues (Geiger and Werner 2009). Trails are therefore seen to be a useful means of satisfying a range of objectives, often at very little cost as many trails consist simply of an interpretive leaflet showing a map with points of interest indicated. Other, more complex trails utilise interpretation panels, sign-posts and markers to guide the visitor. Increasingly, trails information is made available online with dedicated trail websites and interactive maps becoming more common (for example Scotland’s Malt Whisky Trail on www.maltwhiskytrail.com). Trail developers usetrails as a tool for visitor management whilst providing an interesting route to follow. In developing trails, specific themes are chosen and sites selected in order to tell a particular story. The deliberate theming of place though constructs such as trails has come under scrutiny, from Relph (1976) and his ‘museumisation’ of space, to more contemporary authors who comment on the cultural significance of such themed spaces (e.g. Lukas 2007; Urry and Larsen 2011). Relph’s critique of the museumisation of space centres around the imposition of the museum idioms of authority, selectivity and interpretation on public spaces and the trail’s role of highlighting specific sites rejecting a chosen theme can certainly be seen as a contributing factor in this transformation of space, turning real places into trivial and inauthentic areas. Lukas (2007: 2) comments on the ‘immutable and unifying nature that characterises a theme’, suggesting that once a space has been themed, it is difficult to encourage visitors to see it in any other way. When consideringthe borrowed and reworked symbols and meanings that themed spaces utilise in their exploration of the tourist gaze, Urry and Larsen (2011) note that these themed ‘countries’ present appealing aspects of places which may not necessarily relate to actual historical or geographical reality and which may obscure dissonant or contested heritage. Indeed, trails can be seen as the ultimate expression of the tourist gaze as they are designed around visual signs and the route is literally a set of instructions to look at speci?c monuments, buildings or vistas. The points of interest on a trail are ‘… usually …those elements that can appeal to the visual sense and can help tell a story that is mostly structured around a clear chronological logic’ (Markwell et al. 2004: 460). The trail directs the visitor’s gaze away from that which is irrelevant or merely unsightly, thus promoting a highly structured mode of seeing that is said to be characteristic of the tourist’s experience. Of course visitors will always ignore instructions, sabotage arrangements and subvert the hegemonic message of a themed route, and indeed some trails have been designed to encourage visitors to dip in and out of the story and compare heritage themes with contemporary culture on the streets (Shaw and MacLeod 2000). This tendency of tourists towards creativity and subversion has been reflected in the recent ‘performance turn’ in critical studies of tourism which emphasises the active experience of tourism (Edensor 2000) and a multi-sensory ‘embodied gaze’ (Urry and Larsen 2011). This ‘performance turn’ suggests that tourists are no longer simply spectators of an organised scene but wish to be actively engaged, experiencing places sensually. This new way of thinking about tourist practices allows us to reconsider the role and potential of the trail as, ‘in contrast to studies portraying tourism as an over-determined stage where tourists passively follow prescripted routes and scripts, the performance turn also uncovers creativity, detours and productive practices’ (Urry and Larsen 2011: 192–93). To a certain extent, the trail has already been seen to have embraced aspects of the performance turn in encouraging a more embodied gaze through the increasing use of sound. Audio guides have long been used in museums and galleries but new digital technology has allowed the development of downloadable audio trails and mobile applications (‘apps’) to be used flexibly in the field. These audio trails can be followed en route using iPods, MP3 players and mobile phones, and are described as being ‘more nuanced, embodied, complex, multi sensory methods of experiencing and representing our surroundings’ (Butler 2007: 15). Typically they use music, recorded interviews and performance to create a soundscape to be listened to whilst following a map-based trail. An audio trail developed in Wapping in East London, for example, uses the tale of an elderly woman remembering a lost love as the basis for the walk through the area. Community groups were involved in the creation of the walk, which uses speech and sound effects to create a performance in which the user fully participates (Ball et al. 2005). The performance turn in tourism studies can also be considered within the wider context of Pine and Gilmore’s (1999, 2011) influential work on the experience economy, which suggests that contemporary consumers have moved beyond the mere consumption of products and services and are increasingly seeking unique and engaging experiences. The authors apply this new experience economy to all service providers but the concept is perhaps particularly apt in relation to the tourism and hospitality sectors where, for example, the Disney Corporation has been providing successful models of themed experiences since the 1950s (Bryman 1995). Several authors have specifically applied Pine and Gilmore’s ideas to the tourism sector (Richards 2001; Oh et al. 2007; Ek et al. 2008), recognising that the tourism industry has had a pioneering role in the staging of experiences, andVisit Britain reported in 2010 that holidays will become more experiential in the future, concentrating on ‘immersion’ in experience rather than the destination itself (Visit Britain 2010). Pine and Gilmore (1999) claim that experiences fall into four distinctive realms – the entertain-ment, education, aesthetic and escapist realms. Experiences are further characterised according to whether they require active or passive participation and whether they result in the absorption or immersion of the participant. Pine and Gilmore suggest that the most compelling experiences are those that encompass all four realms in the ‘sweet spot’ or ‘optimal tourist experience’, as Oh et al. (2007: 121) define it. In order to assist providers in designing experiences that hit this ‘sweet spot’, the authors propose four principles: provide a compelling theme; use positive cues to afirm the nature of the experience; provide memorabilia as a physical reminder of the encounter; and?nally, utilise all four senses to fully enrol and engage participants (Pine and Gilmore 1999; Pine and Gilmore 2011). As tools for encouraging more engagement with place, trails may benefit from a more experiential approach to their design, as explored in the case study (Box 46.1). Although the research presented in the case study did find examples of good practice in the production of engaging and creative trails, the findings suggest that trails are still being viewed as products rather than experiences by their developers. It would appear that more could be done to realise the potential of English town trails (and by extension, all routes and trails) to provide more interesting and interactive ‘optimal tourist experiences’ (Oh et al. 2007). © 2013 Melanie Smith and Greg Richards.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029619847

The problem of suddenly finding myself to be a stranger in my own land began as a personal concern, but migrated into a professional sociological concern as I designed a GTM study that would allow me to examine the issue from a wider perspective.For this study, I conducted 19 two-to-three hour interviews of individuals who fit the criteria of professional migrants. The transcripts were analyzed in the computer program MAXQDA. Analysis included reviewing the interview transcripts multiple times, coding them, writing memos, and sketching diagrams that would describe my emerging notions. While autoethnography was a starting point for my work, GTM was central to the research design and analysis techniques I followed.This investigation revealed that smaller cities in Mexico, a rapidly developing nation, are experiencing a broad range of social pressures at many levels of society. These pressures result in sharp dichotomies that are experienced among insiders and outsiders. Thus, in Aguascalientes, insiders, on the one hand, present themselves to outsiders as hermetic, double-sided, mediocre, incompetent, and, on the other hand, they also present themselves as kind, open, good people, having a strong civic education. These strong contrasts in how insiders and outsiders view each other seem to be an expression of wider changes in which individuals find themselves in the modern Mexican context. © 2012 FQS.","Autoethnography; CAQDAS; Grounded theory methodology; Local culture; Mexico; Migration; Sense of self",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870588985

Major thoroughfares and a large expressway bring thousands of visitors each day by bus and car to its entrances and labyrinthine underground parking lots, while Seoul's subway lines 2 and 8 intersect at a busy transfer station that opens to a subterranean shopping arcade, which in turn feeds effortlessly into Lotte World itself (ibid.). Inside and around the massive structure is an overwhelming array of stores, services, and amusements: clothing, souvenir, and department stores; opticians; pharmacies; restaurants; snack vendors; plazas; a ""traditional market""; two theme parks - one indoors and one outdoors; performance stages; a multiplex cinema; a full-service health spa; a massive water park that could best be likened to an artificial lake; an artificial lake that makes the water park seem diminutive; a luxurious hotel, with all of the accoutrements befitting its four-star rating; an art gallery; a concert hall; and a medical clinic that not only offers plastic surgery and dentistry but also includes an ob-gyn practice, thereby affirming the hermetic nature of this world (see Figure 2.1). At the very top of the complex is a folklore museum, while at the very bottom, in an odd and probably accidental homage to Dante's Inferno, an enormous ice-skating rink. Taken as a whole, Lotte World could be seen as a nightmarish example of what Frederic Jameson has labeled ""a mutation in built space itself"" (Jameson 1991, 38). However, the majority of Lotte World's visitors see it as a considerable achievement that brings the fantasy worlds of shopping malls, amusement parks, sports halls, and museums together in one convenient package, making the ""other,"" the ""exotic,"" and the ""adventurous-yet-safe"" easily accessible to a massive urban population.2 Lotte World is billed by its giant parent conglomerate as the world's largest indoor amusement park and shopping mall, a claim that is echoed almost verbatim by the Mall of America outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada. These complexes share certain extreme visions of both shopping and entertainment, at the same time as they significantly refigure the ways in which people come together to form fleeting communities, the manner in which class and age distinctions become inscribed on the lived urban environment, and the ways in which things - including space - are consumed. What sets all of these places apart from either their shopping mall forebears or their theme park cousins is the combination of a themed amusement park with the choreographed space of the shopping mall. In exploring this development in design, Rodrigo Salcedo mentions, ""For mall developers and managers, the mall is a dreamland aimed at rescuing citizens from the problems of everyday life. Thus, 'West Edmonton Mall' promotes itself as a 'shoppers' dream and a world of excitement and adventure' "" (2003, 1087-1088). Similar motivations can be ascribed to the designers of Lotte World, who consciously shifted away from solely offering themed amusements toward the synergy of the amusement park and shopping. In an introduction to a volume considering the design aesthetics of both shopping malls and theme parks, Sarah Chaplin and Eric Holding observe, ""Contrary to modernist arguments about authenticity, these places are where authentic experiences of modern life now occur, places where people meet, make friends and deal with their sense of alienation generated by the kind of sensory urban overload which Georg Simmel noted in his 1906 essay, The Metropolis and Mental Life"" (1998, 8). To suggest that the denizens of Seoul suffer from ""urban overload"" and its attendant sense of alienation may be an understatement. Numerous critical studies have highlighted the shift in networks and communities presaged by the huge apartment complexes that now dominate Seoul's residential landscape (Gelezeau 1999, 2003). Similarly, other studies have traced the rise of youth subcultures starting in the early 1990s that specifically address aspects of alienation and urban overload among the middle class (Epstein 2000; Epstein and Tangherlini 2002). Because of these rapid changes in the man-made environment and the simultaneous urbanization of the population, community structures were profoundly altered. Consequently, patterns of socialization and interaction have been adapted to this urban environment, and sites of leisure, such as Lotte World, have taken on an important function beyond their obvious role as places where things are bought and sold. At Lotte World, for instance, middle school and high school students reaffirm important peer relationships while waiting in line for the flume ride, parents bond with young children while watching the Lotty and Lorry parade, grandparents interact informally with their grandchildren while tossing wooden sticks in a traditional game of yutnori at the folklore museum, colleagues solidify work relationships while fine-tuning their golf swings at the indoor driving range, and friends discuss everyday concerns while bargain hunting on the subterranean ""Trevi Fountain"" plaza. All of these activities highlight connectedness and are integral to aspects of urban socialization, community formation, and enculturation. They also constitute important ""authentic"" experiences of the urban middle class, even if the surroundings are decidedly ""inauthentic."" People enjoy the replicas - of buildings, of places, of historical times, and of experiences - but are not for a minute fooled by them; the kids on the flume ride are well aware they are riding a flume ride in Lotte World, and not coursing down a tributary to the Amazon in a dugout canoe. This abandonment of an overarching concern with an external authentic referent is a crucial development. Earlier themed spaces stretching back to Skansen and Maihaugen in Scandinavia and the cultural exhibitions of the world's fairs often strove for mimetic representation of foreign places or the past (Bendix 1997; Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1998; Sandberg 2003; Tangherlini 2008). By rejecting these earlier forms of authenticity, the mall and the theme park now emphasize consumption and efficiency. An interesting aspect of this shift away from the external logic of authenticity is the increasing role that consumption plays as a backdrop for activities such as family bonding or other types of community formation. Rather than casting a wistful eye away to the ""foreign"" or back in time toward the older and therefore more ""authentic,"" as implicit in earlier theme parks and museum displays, the current parks - and shopping malls for that matter - embrace the notion that all experiences are authentic. Susan Davis notes, ""Unlike the rock concert, and more like the shopping mall, the theme park depends on the construction of a landscape and the careful planning of human movement through space. The spatial rationale of the theme park is to cluster commercial opportunities - from hot dog stands to designer boutiques - around attractions which can range from rides to human or animal or robotic performances"" (1996, 403). Mark Gottdiener continues, observing that these ""themed environments work not only because they are connected to the universe of commodities and are spaces of consumption, but because they offer consumers a spatial experience that is an attraction by itself; that is, they promote the consumption of space"" (1998, 15). I can think of few places where this is more apparent than at Lotte World. The shopping mall-cum-theme park and the theme park-cum- shopping mall are clearly related phenomena, not only in their physical design but also as products of similar historical processes. Both are loci of interrelated consumption, and both offer an important window onto how the middle class lives. Although the lifestyles of the Korean middle class have become an object of increasing academic interest (Hart 2001; Kendall 2002; Moon 1997a; Nelson 2000), the majority of the scholarly study of theme parks and shopping malls has been directed at North American examples or, in some limited cases, on Western European analogs (Backes 1997; Bloch, Ridgway, and Dawson 1994; Kowinski 1985; Sandicki and Holt 1998; Sherry 1998; Vester 1996). Joy Hendry's work exploring the wide range of theme parks that have cropped up in Japan marks a welcome departure from this theoretical homogeneity (2000a). She proposes that ""contextualized cultural description"" might be a better approach than ""decontextualized grand theory,"" since she worries that Western analytical models may not be able to explain East Asian cultural phenomena (ibid.). Yet processes of globalization and capital development, as well as the lively two-way street that now exists between nodes of capital, such as Seoul and Los Angeles, all mean that an exclusion of Western interpretive models would be equally irresponsible. Writing about the advent of enormous shopping mall/theme park complexes in Southeast Asia, Alyson Brody observes that ""in the space-restricted, hot, polluted city"" these megalithic complexes serve ""as all-encompassing leisure spaces, places where families and young couples alike can spend the day eating in restaurants, drinking coffee, seeing movies, and even go ice-skating or bowling. They are, in other words, hyper-modern expressions of new . . . middle-class lifestyles and mentalities"" (Brody 2006, 541). This observation also holds true for Lotte World. © 2011 by University of Hawai'i Press. All Rights Reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898374943

Nevertheless, rapid growth of consuming economy and the emphases on functional character without linkage to different environmental socio-cultural and economical condition led to model of design that cannot reproduce their valued in landscape. This process result is unsustainably in rural environment. Sustainable literature introduced different aspect of this unsustainably and prevention methods. However, less attention paid to the nature of operational method. Nature of design is base on dialectic linkage between social and natural systems and holism approach. Therefore, sustainable environmental design without paying attention to different factors, social groups, stockholders and their behaviors is impossible. When design will be reach to its optimal condition that happen in social context with applying participatory methods. Participatory methods prepare context to increase sustainable environmental actions. Participation can improve conditions that affect the sustainable environment. Some sample proved that applying participatory methods could improve result of design and shape new approach in local community to apply in different process designs. Applying participatory methods has two face of a coin. It has positive impact but result in negative impacts. Since, this function needs to manage and solve inherent conflicts. Design shapes a spatial landscape. Based on landscape, convention of Europe can define as an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors. Rural environment also as cultural landscape is the result of interact of rural groups in a humannatural distinct context. Rural landscape has two basic aspects: 1- External landscape include pattern of houses, agricultural lands, and other physical characteristics, 2- Internal systems include organizing social and economical relationship pattern of rural groups. These shapes create an environmental base to find out the complexity of cultural - humanity relationships and spatial characteristics. Productions of these systems are defined as rural texture. Today Iranian rural landscape and rural texture experience changes seriously. Rural traditional structure replaced by modern and urbanized structures, biological and aesthetical degradation. Despite of burgeoning amount of literature and information, the continual accumulation of relevant knowledge in sustainability, rural landscapes, especially in Iran, experience new spatial challenges that indicate unsustainable environment. New and urbanized approach is dominant in rural environmental design with extended indigenous pattern of design, shortcoming of designer in rural domain. Abuse and unused of natural capacity led to rupture and disarray in rural texture. Design without community participation and unnecessary change in settlements pattern, intensity disorder in rural environment and cultural landscape. This situation emphasizes the need of new approach to control impacts of unsuitable interventions and reorientation future rural landscape design. Participatory design provides context and tools to improve rural environment interventions. In the traditional system, the driving force of landscape development was based on natural, socioeconomic factors that led to real participation of local villagers in shaping their organic landscape and satisfaction their needs related to the physical environment. Iranian rural modernization impacts shape a new uniform of landscape that reflect only consuming and urbanism culture without any identity. Rural landscapes are discrete of environment, socioeconomic and cultural identity.Applying participatory methods in design adjusts discretion, unwanted and undesired changes in rural textures. However, it should be noticed that participation is a sword with two edges. It can help to improve the rural design or may lead to some disadvantages. Management of applying participation methods is necessity. Rural environment intervention and design take place in different shapes and names in Iran. Most famous and widespread project named ""Tarh e Hadi"" or Physical Guide Plan (PGP). PGPs are planned and designed for 18955 villages, implemented in 8742 villages and 2101 project underway. Planning and designing process of PGPs was evaluated. This evaluation was based on general approach. The result of evaluation showed little attention paid to participation and participatory design. This evaluation reflected some aspects of reality that showed the effect of quality of design by participating in right manner. This article is to prove the effects of participation in some aspects of PGPs Planning and design process by using nine variables. These variables showed some realty reflected in evaluation, we use real results to show role of participation. These indexes are: Forecast of natural disaster Investigate historical places in villages Analysis and design of village pathway network Direction of villages' Physical development Design approach Realty in design Design criterion Implantation priority Implantation management Results of variables: -Forecast of natural disasterForecast of natural disaster is possible by scientific method. Moreover, based on behavioral psychology, people can presented some useful information about history of disaster. However, this aspect is neglected in PGPs. Collection of real data about disasters history and its results are simply possible by participatory methods. -Investigate historical places in villages: Some villages contain historical houses or monument that needs to be identified in process of PGP studies. However, outsider designer and planner, who came to village and spent time, were not successful to identify these valuable places. Local people participated for identifying valuable places and design proper action to protect these places. -Analysis and design of village pathways Pathways network shape structure of village's texture. Any analysis of this network is based on reality and people needs. Without understanding of people requirements, design would lead to differentiations between existence and proposal condition; therefore, the final proposed plan will not be accepted by local community. Participation helped injecting facts, realty, and local needs in analyses and thus design resulted to integrated texture design, satisfaction of needs that will be more acceptable. -Physical development direction of villages: In addition, design oriented physical development of villages for further development. Different factor affected on this direction, but most important one is local people approach. Without people participation, conflicts arise between people and operational organization. By increasing participation, these orientations adjust more with local people opinion. -Design approach Design is complex and its results must be reflection of different sounds and aspects. Unfortunately, research showed physical and technical approach dominant in PGP design. About 70.6 percent of samples uphold these conditions. Neglecting the economical aspects, social bases and cultural forces led to conflicted in new and existence textures. Participation tools were the best context for interrelationship between design and socio-cultural forces. -Design criterion: PGPs should guide future development for any village by present basic design criterion. It is clear that design criterion should deduction from real facts of the nature of rural environment, community present and future needs. Nevertheless, research explains that design criterions were based on urban standards with any references to local identity. Participation design helped to define design criterion deduction from eal world. Applying participatory methods and tools simply changed criterion defines methods and results. -Implantation priority PGPs like all projects will be translated to some actions with priorities. Origin of priority is based on the need of community, potential of change and actions roles in development and so on. Because most of projects must, satisfaction of community needs thus key role will be play by people. Recognition of needs and ranking need base on people opinion can happen by participatory methods. Without participation, this process faces with serious challenges. Research show that 50 percent of samples faced with this problem and 50 percent did not ranking projects. Implantation managementProject implementations need to local management. When participation takes place, community can provide proper local organization for implementation. These methods empower community to control changes in village environment and obtain new experiment. Nevertheless, non-participatory design and planning in PGPs resulted to suggestion of new organization with emphasis on outsiders. Outsider instantiations are dominating and less attention pay to local community. Finally, researches proved that: -First rural people willing to participation in PGPs and; -Second, even weak participation in planning and design improves the quality of PGP seriously. Participation in different process of planning and design of PGPs resulted to reflect community needs, socio-economic and cultural facts, adjust changes with realty, prevent of conflicts between people and organization and best satisfaction of community needs. Moreover, it empowers locale people to manage community and make a sense of identity in rural environment design. All these factors led to design sustainable rural landscape.","Cultural landscape; Participation; Participatory design; Rural environment; Rural landscape",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952144565

Being the second largest city in Slovakia, it became an important centre of economy, trade, education and culture in the new state. The number of its citizens increased fast. In 1921 Košice had 52,898 inhabitants, and by 1938 the number went up to 80,000. Košice joined Europe and the rest of the world with an extended airline from Prague through Bratislava in 1924. The railway built earlier had a great influence on industrial development. The large increase in the number of inhabitants was connected with the large construction boom and consequent significant regional growth of Košice. New districts originated and modern architecture entered the centre. New essential offices and municipal services were built, such as new and modern centre for five brigade, new state schools, churches, synagogues, hotels, restaurants, department stores, cinemas, sports facilities, swimming pools and flats for the new state employees. The interwar architecture of Košice meanwhile very evidently copied the same developmental phases as are seen in the architecture of the European metropolises. This positive developmental phase lasted approximately until 1938. The exhibition entitled ""The Provincial Exhibition of the Czechoslovak East"" took place in Košice in August 1938. It was the first large general exhibition in Slovakia, which presented the results of the young state's development between 1918 and 1938, mainly in Slovakia and in all fields: culture, health service, industry, business and sport. To host this exceptionally significant occasion, the town chose the large premises of a Higher School of Economics in the north-western part of the town. Favourably located near the town centre, the venue was a pleasant and quick destination for walking as well as motorized visitors, and the already functioning tram directly connected it with the existing railway. The adequate size of the area spreading over 174,000 m2 - the exhibition part itself being 80,000 m2 - helped to fully unfold the exhibition programme in both aspects of area and space. The ground-plan disposition of the exhibition developed along two axes, parallel with today's Letná street and Komenského street. The main entrance to the exhibition hall was from Letná street. The exhibition class measured 350 metres and was dominated by the main two-storeyed pavilion of the Czechoslovak State at the end. Other exhibition pavilions mainly bordered the left side and were to form the foundation of the future Technical University. This part housed the business, trade and industrial expositions, as well as rental pavilions in an area of around 26,000 m2. Other expositions, technical and agricultural, were added at a reasonable spatial and architectural distance. An amusement park with various interesting attractions was situated at the northern part of the exhibition over an area of 15,000 m2 (restaurant, light fountain, music pavilion, parachute tower, death wall, big wheel and others). The exposition Cultures, which featured art, health service, folk culture, educational training, theatre, societies' activities, printing and various museum fields, was situated in the north-eastern part of the exhibition area in the existing building of Northern State Public School. The ground floor housed the exposition of Slovak Industrial Education. The pavilion of Slovak Land showed an integrated picture of Slovakia and its development since 1918. Also present were the expositions of the republic's capitals - Prague, Brno, Bratislava and Uzhgorod. Košice had a separate pavilion. Prague's exposition was the richest. Its installation predominantly captured the relations between Prague and Slovakia as well as other Slovak townsfrom days gone by. The exposition Land and People was one of the largest. It covered all fields that were closely related to agriculture, including the advanced Slovak collective farming and wood industry, exposition of land reform and Slovak mining. Folklore was also part of the exposition, exhibiting the characteristic Slovak folk costumes, songs and customs. The exposition Technology and Industry displayed the industrial development and technical progress of Slovakia over the 20 years of its independence. It embraced all fields, including state railways, surface routes, water routes, radio, air service and electrification. Czechoslovak mail had a separate exposition. Part of the exposition Cultures was a department dedicated to fine arts and music. All significant sculptors and painters were represented. The world-known Slovak gothic style enjoyed a special attention; its exposition was installed in an improvised medieval church. The selection of construction and materials for the newly proposed projects depended on whether the Technical University would use these after the end of the exhibition or if they were to be dismantled and transferred to another place, or used as construction material. The goal was to fit the construction budget, which meant building as cheaply as possible while at the same time follow the architectural criteria that were adequately significant for this jubilee exhibition. Individual exhibition pavilions were built in three ways: the four main pavilions, which were to be used by the Technical University after the end of the exhibition (the Czechoslovak State, Slovak Land, Land and People, Technology and Industry) had a bearing construction and ferro-concrete ceilings, an enclosure construction built of brick, beam filling made of boards and wood wool and plastering done from the outside. The standardised pavilions for rental areas of various exhibitors (The Capitals, The Town of Košice, Electrical Plants, Gas Company and Water Works, Business and Trades), which were designated for business, trade and industry, and the pavilion for forest management were built exclusively of wood and glass. The pavilions of various private firms were built of various construction materials in such a way that they could be easily dismantled. Notwithstanding; several had appealing and characteristic exterior architectural conceptions. Glass for the glass-covered areas was simply loaned for economic reasons. With regard to the future premises of the Technical University of M. R. Štefánik in Košice, the reconstruction of the main exhibition pavilion of the Czechoslovak State was planned to start in the autumn, right after the end of the exhibition. It was supposed to be one of the main buildings of the university's future premises. Other exhibition pavilions were also in consideration, for example the pavilion of the Slovak Land, naturally added with necessary construction and technical adjustments. Only the bare framework was to be used. Walls were to be built in brick and temporary windows were to be exchanged for new ones, and central heating was to be installed into the technology building. Also planned was the new construction of the main building of the rector's office, administration and pavilion for technical tools, etc. The exhibition visitors were startled by the volume and richness of the exhibition. The gates of the country's exhibition of the Czechoslovak East in Košice closed on September 4, 1938. The exhibition, seen by 340,000 visitors had fulfilled its mission. Czech architect Miloslav Kopřiva significantly contributed to the realisation of the Exhibition of the Czechoslovak East in Košice. It was he who designed the conception - the idea of the whole exhibition area, which he composed around two urban axes. He also proposed some pavilions. Several conditions had to be respected when designing the main exhibition pavilions. This meant that the creation was to be of such a constructional and dispositional design that only minimal adjustments would facilitate the transformation of the pavilions into future buildings of the Technical University. Despite a very tied budget, Kopřiva together with other Košice architects, like Rudolf Brepta, the project designer of the main pavilion of the Czechoslovak State, L'udovít Oelschläger, Ernest Friedmann and V. Sipos, created a remarkable work in its time, which both fulfilled the intended goal and allowed these buildings to still serve the university's needs.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59749105533

Yet, it is also true that some effective strategies are employed in these novels to subvert control by the system and disrupt the architectural armature imposed on the cityscape and human psyche alike.

They often require personal sacrifice (e.g., less living space and fewer cars per capita) in return for public gains (cleaner air and equality of access).

These changes are not to be interpreted as homogenious adaptations abstract global effects, but they are translated in a dynamic process and mixed with existing (and ""traditional"") everyday practices. In urban space. which is composed by the materiality, historicity, social practice, and experience of the people who live this space are inscribed. Therefore urban space as a site of the local can be considered as the site where global tendencies we adopted subjectively and on the level of everyday life. Possible subjects to analyse theses complex layers of global effects and local phenomena are for example a) space, environment, architecture, b) everyday practice and experience. c commodities and consumption. Mexico City is a place where indicators of globalisation are materialised. The economic development of the last 30 years provoked urban transformation processes, which can be recognised as an ""intensification of urban space"" and processes of ""new centrality"". The architectural and ethnographic research of specific urban spaces provide access to both ""micro"" and ""macro"" visions of the local and the global of the metropolis.

It emphasizes the need for a symbiosis between an appropriate urban design and the natural transformation that occurs with the placement of sculptures in an urban context. It comments on several examples of planned artistic interventions and, in particular, analyses a recent major project of urban design in Concepcion, the third largest city in Chile. An environmental vision, that addresses itself to the contemporary city's development, has also to consider that urban spaces should provide adequate venues for leisure and civic entertainment for the inhabitant. Historically, the notion of art has been associated with the degree of culture of society and, indeed, it represents the expression and spirit of our urban communities. Hence, together with the macro-planning goals of development, there exists a chance to restore people's sense of belonging and pride of place, providing adequate spaces related to artistic manifestations that can contribute to the overall quality of life in neighbourhoods and inner city areas. The conclusions suggest that these types of artistic expression can be a key factor, but only by integration, that is a combination of an appropriate scale of intervention through urban design, rather than 'parachuting' the art into different places. © 1997 E. & EN Spon.",,"public art; urban design; urban planning; Chile, Concepcion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031403512

We propose by studying urban organisms, urban biotic communities, the urban biome, and the interactions between the urban biome and peri-urban built and natural environments, we can (1) discover new ""rules of life"" for the structure, function, interaction, and evolution of organisms; (2) use these discoveries to understand how novel emerging biotic communities affect and are affected by anthropogenic environmental changes in climate and other environmental factors; and (3) apply what we have learned to engage residents of the urban biome, and design cities that are more biologically diverse, are provided with more and better ecosystem services, and are more equitable and healthier places to live. The built environment of the urban biome is a place that reflects history, economics, technology, governance, culture, and values of the human residents; research on and applications of the rules of life in the urban biome can be used by all residents in making choices about the design of the cities where they live. Because inhabitants are directly invested in the environmental quality of their neighborhoods, research conducted in and about the urban environment provides a great opportunity to engage wide and diverse communities of people. Given the opportunity to engage a broad constituency-from basic researchers to teachers, civil engineers, landscape planners, and concerned citizens-studying the translation of the rules of life onto the urban environment will result in an integrative and crosscutting set of questions and hypotheses, and will foster a dialog among citizens about the focus of urban biome research and its application toward making more equitable, healthy, livable, sustainable, and biodiverse cities. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

However, which elements users most require, appreciate or notice has rarely been examined as the basis of their choice for specific PUGS, especially in poorer neighbourhoods and countries, where formal PUGS may be limited. The study was carried out in two towns in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, both characterized by high poverty and unemployment levels, low literacy rates and many people living without basic infrastructure and services. To understand the meanings people, have for specific PUGS elements, formal and informal PUGS and peri-urban municipal commonages were assessed with respect to the natural and artificial elements present. A survey of 360 households was conducted across two towns by targeting PUGS users and households within 100 m from the designated PUGS. Approximately 63% of the respondents visited PUGS, with informal PUGS being the most frequented. However, they were strong negative feelings towards some natural elements because of their unkempt nature. Issues of safety, cultural restrictions and lack of recreational facilities were mentioned as some of the specific deterrents against visiting the closest PUGS among different user and age groups. Most respondents emphasized the need for PUGS that are well laid out with maintained lawns, recreational facilities and open vegetation. Thus, the current design and available features within the studied PUGS do not meet local preferences and needs and thus do not contribute to enjoyment as much as they could.

Therefore, it is necessary to take the initiative to respond to the rapid change of the demand brought by the urban change and create a pleasant cultural space. However, the historical block is large in scale and rich in details, and the design of its public facilities requires not only a broad range of material resources, but also a plethora of manpower.

Wilson, both of whom agree that biophilia has a biological basis and that it is fundamental to develop harmonious relationships between humans and the biosphere. This review aims at establishing a definition of biophilia as an evolutionary process. To this end, the most significant studies of evolutionary psychology were considered, to outline the fundamental characteristics of a hypothetical biophilic temperament/personality and to reconstruct a plausible history of biophilia as an evolutionary process. This process considers different typologies of Nature (wilderness, rural, and urban) and human cultures (Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Burg) and leads us to consider environmental preference and psycho-physiological recovery in relation to the threshold of time spent in contact with Nature. Unfortunately, modern people, especially children, lack direct and frequent contact with Nature and this can have negative consequences on their physical and mental health. Biophilic design, considering the evolutionary roots of this architectural approach, is an effective way of planning/designing interior and urban environments to stimulate the innate biophilia of the individual. © Copyright © 2021 Barbiero and Berto.","biophilia hypothesis; biophilia ontogenesis; biophilia phylogenesis; biophilic design; biophilic temperament",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111929688

With the increasing expansion of modern cities along the vertical dimension, how urban rivers affect housing values and homebuyers' purchasing decisions in a 3-D context has attracted a significant amount of attention from researchers, environmental practitioners, urban planners, and policymakers. In this paper, we attempt to estimate how homebuyers' utilities are affected by various river attributes and their interactions using the vibrant high-rise apartment housing market in Guangzhou (south China) as a case study. An appropriate 3-D weights matrix is identified using ex ante Monte Carlo simulation combined with ex post validation on the basis of information criteria. By using the identified 3-D spatial weights scheme in a multilevel autoregressive modelling framework, an intricate combination of multidimensional spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence can be sufficiently accounted for. Our analytical results reveal that river view and riverfront location are considered as negative utilities by Guangzhou's homebuyers, showing the significant negative impacts of river pollution. Yet, the proximity to urban rivers is regarded as a positive utility, revealing that homebuyers enjoy a sense of being close to nature and an emotional bond with traditional water culture. The black-odorous river water itself devalues apartment prices and adds the negative utilities of river view and riverfront location. Riparian greening would command a price premium, as well as mitigate the negative utilities of river view and riverfront location. Although the availability of walking paths and sitting benches along river stretches is generally regarded as a positive utility, it may worsen the negative impact of river view, but enhance the positive impact of river proximity. These results provide deeper managerial insights into how different river attributes influence apartment buyers' utilities and thus help environmental managers (in collaboration with housing developers) design urban river restoration initiatives so as to create pleasant and attractive neighbourhoods for prospective homebuyers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","3-D spatial weights scheme; Apartment housing market; Hedonic price method; Multilevel autoregressive model; Urban river stretch","Apartment houses; Environmental management; Location; Managers; Monte Carlo methods; Rivers; Analytical results; Auto regressive models; Autoregressive modelling; Environmental managers; Information criterion; Purchasing decisions; Spatial heterogeneity; Vertical dimensions; River pollution; river water; hedonic analysis; heterogeneity; housing market; management practice; neighborhood; river water; three-dimensional modeling; urban housing; water quality; apartment; Article; China; city planning; construction work and architectural phenomena; controlled study; emotion; environmental planning; hedonic analysis; homebuyer; housing; miscellaneous named groups; Monte Carlo method; neighborhood; purchasing; real estate market; riparian ecosystem; river; spatial analysis; spatial multilevel autoregressive model; statistical analysis; statistical model; water pollution; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100613938

However, a crisis phenomenon is stored behind the city's greatness due to human behavior within it. One aspect mostly affected is an ecological one. This study focused on the urban ecological crisis in Surakarta City. This paper's research question is; what type of individualistic behavior of the people of Surakarta City? What environmental sector is closest to an ecological crisis indicator according to local communities? Does individualistic behavior affect the higher level of ecological crisis in Surakarta? The author used a mixed-method with a quantitative-dominant and qualitative-less design. Field research procedure has been conducted involving observation, in-depth interviews, and quantitative survey. The statistical analysis process with Pearson's correlation model shows a positive relationship between individualistic behavior and the ecological crisis in Surakarta City. The finding in the individualistic variable is mostly affected by comers' existence and the suspicion among fellow citizens, leading to the revocation deprivation of social values and the fading gotong royong (mutual cooperation) culture.

Respondents were asked to rate the importance of a number of factors, while thinking about the park they were visiting, using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was undertaken. The results of the scores revealed differences between the two types of park. A factor analysis of the pooled results revealed that the key aspects contributing to a visit were named as ‘having fun and enjoying oneself ', in a place with ŉo barriers to using the park’ and ‘leaving one’s cares behind’ followed by ‘relaxing in the presence of natural beauty’. A further Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling analysis was undertaken to determine the main factors affecting the differences in preference for each type of park in relation to the key demographic variables. This revealed that the modern parks were preferred over the traditional ones for three significant sets of factors-recreation, accessibility and culture-and that there was a tendency for the historical parks to been favoured by more educated people. The conclusions are that the modern parks support the main preferred activities to support the quality of life of the population-not through their design per se but because they offer many more recreational opportunities. There is potential to include traditional elements such as water features more into parks. Park planners can take the findings and use them to help improve the quality of the parks over time. © 2021 by the authors.

The implicit traffic-system cues play an important role in explaining urban traffic-culture. This paper aims to ascertain an interpretive framework of the alternative processes of road traffic safety culture is antecedent to promote traffic-safety behaviour in Indian urban context. Subsequently, the authors discussed the reasons for those relationships exists. Design/methodology/approach: Four experts of the urban traffic-safety domain participated in total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) study by completing an interpretive consensus-driven questionnaire. The drafted interpretive model was evaluated for road users proactive action orientation about the traffic-safety decision. Findings: The evolved directed graph (digraph) of the culture of urban traffic-safety management was a serial three-mediator model. The model argued: In the presence of traffic-risk cues, people may become apprised to safety goals that initiate traffic-safety action. Consequently, expectancy-value evaluation motivates the continuation of traffic-safety intention that may lead to the implementation of adaptation plan (volitional control), thus habituating road users to traffic-safety management choice. Practical implications: The modellers of traffic psychology may empirically estimate and test for the quality criteria to ascertain the applicability of the proposed mechanism of urban traffic-safety culture. The decision-makers should note the importance of arousal of emotions regarding traffic-risk, reduce the impact of maladaptive motivations and recursively improve control over safety actions for promoting safety interventions.

The local neighbourhood is very important to understand how people conceive the city in their minds. The representative memory captures the elements related to spatial identity of a place, but more often than not, these representations are pictorial images superimposed upon the fabric resulted from the standardized tools used for analysing the spatial qualities and its attributes. The recognition of the finding to capture elements related to experiences of spatial identity problematizes from well-established urban design spatial theories. On the other hand, Indian city is a collective of people, place and events. These neighbourhoods may not be central to social or business relationships nor centre for historic monuments, but the activities, users, events, location and spatial conditions that support them are very different—together key to the legibility of the city. More often than not, the impacts due to the city’s regeneration process sustain the test of time and manifest into a deeper system for building an image of the place. Hence, embedded meaning and meaningful association over time become crucial for the built morphology. One such neighbourhood is Pettah1—the old core of city of Bangalore. Bengaluru was one of the key trading centres of the south during the pre-colonial era. The idea of a town structured around Pettah (market), Kote2 (fort), Kere3 (lakes and tanks) and Totha4 (gardens and parks) was an unquestionable matrix of natural occurrences and cultural practices. Decades to follow many influences on to the town added a layer of new structure, and every stage of progress enunciated the past with a new skin of elements. It is this value of city’s memory that lie buried within us carrying forward our past into its present fabric. Hence, the study reveals the need to radically departure from the routines of recording legibility and imageability through mental, sensory and visual mapping and to record in terms of space, events, time, activities as well as sense of public-ness. Ultimately, the findings also brings optimism into urban design practice, offering new insight into how to record mosaic of an area in an Indian city that will capture the strong perceived and conceived imagery of a place and hence sensitive responsive proposals that will aid to carefully conceive a system for the future. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Character; Culture; Elusive; Morphology; Neighbourhood",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101173272

Specific objectives include study local stakeholders' view on the motivation of visitors, the image of the city they carry home, role of infrastructure development altering sacredness of the city, major issues pertaining to conservation of the city's religious heritage and whether tourism dominates the sacred space of the city. Design/methodology/approach: The present study follows the philosophical approach of constructionism and is an inductive study based on the ontological features of realism. The study is conducted using qualitative research design. Participants were purposely selected from different groups to provide representative data. through in-depth interviews with a set of 22 open-ended questions. Findings: The study acknowledged the spatial changes happening in an old city over time. The portrayed image of Varanasi remains deeply rooted in the minds of pilgrims, whereas the tourist perspective often goes beyond the texts as an experience. The reflection of local stakeholders in the transformation of sacred space to tourist experiencescape as a consumable experience, which is influenced by market-driven forces is a major finding of the study. Research limitations/implications: Difficulties in finalising the respondents and building up the theoretical base, which is one of the main limitations of the study. During the process of data collection, the respondents mainly focussed upon the impacts of tourism on Varanasi, and the researchers made every effort to extract qualitative information on the current research. At times, some respondents hesitated to share their view on political influences in the development process, which restricted the authors to obtain righteous information, that could have contributed a better understanding of the deep-rooted issues of religious heritage conservation. Another limitation is that the perspectives of visitors have not been included in this research. Practical implications: The study will contribute to the theoretical areas of tourism development in historic and sacred cities. As an interdisciplinary area, the selected theme of the study delves in to landscape planning, heritage preservation, tourism development in historic cities and more importantly how residents understand the changes happening in a scared environment. The present research opens opportunities for further researches such as social pressures and tourism development, urban morphology and its transformation in ancient cities and so on. Social implications: Varanasi is an ancient city in India, which is also the heartland of Hinduism. The study reveals the understanding of respondents on religious traditions, sentiments and the social values attached to a place. At the same time, it also highlights the role of tourism in generating an intercultural dialogue with local cultures, appreciating the sacred value of sites associated with religious sentiments.

The conceptual model offers an open, polythetic and integrative approach to the vernacular by assuming that it operates in different dimensions (temporal, socio-political, sociological, locational, epistemological, procedural, economic and functional), and that the many attributes or characteristics included in those dimensions are all relevant but not strictly necessary. The model is intended to facilitate a more methodical and rigorous connection between the vernacular concept and contemporary discourses on sustainability, resilience, globalization, governance, and rural-urban development. In addition, and due to its transdisciplinary character, the model will enable the development of comparative studies within and between a wide range of fields (architecture, landscape studies, design, planning and geography). A prospective analysis of the use of the model in rural landscapes reveals its potential to mediate between the protective approach that has characterized official planning during the last decades and emergent approaches that advocate the reinterpretation of the vernacular as a new form to generate new collective identities and to reconnect people and place. © 2020 by the authors.","Cultural landscapes; Globalization; Landscape governance; Landscape planning; Material culture; Place-making; Rural landscapes; Sustainable development; Sustainable landscape; Vernacular architecture; Vernacular design","comparative study; globalization; interdisciplinary approach; numerical model; rural landscape; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090089878

Work, education, social participation: all these activities generate regular journeys. Particularly in cities, however, the “side effects” of mobility such as traffic jams, traffic accidents, air pollution, noise and the resulting health effects are also evident. The planning of settlement structures, the necessary infrastructures, and the design of urban spaces are tasks of urban planning. Urban planning can have a decisive influence on the means of transport people choose, the distances they travel, and the environmental and health effects associated with these choices. This article examines how urban planning can promote alternatives to motorized individual travel. It focuses in particular on active mobility, such as cycling and walking. The paper begins by presenting the fundamental effects of everyday mobility and the resulting traffic on health. It then gives an overview of the potential for promoting active mobility in Germany and how urban planning and the factors it regulates, such as settlement density or mix of uses, influence mobility decisions. An overview of current initiatives and an in-depth presentation of planning strategies in the cities of Barcelona and Bogotá will be used to show which instruments and measures are being used. The article emphasizes that urban planning and the built environment it creates can promote walking and cycling. The examples show, however, that promising initiatives are not realised through spatial planning and the creation of infrastructure alone.

Culture and background are important influences on how people respond to their environments and, as populations become more diverse, it might be expected that public spaces respond to more diverse preferences. In New Zealand, despite its bi-cultural history, it is largely European preferences that have shaped public spaces. However, with immigration and travel, the country is rapidly becoming multicultural, with Pasifika people and Asians making up larger proportions of the population alongside those who identify as Māori and European. If public spaces are to respond to these changing demographics, there is little empiric evidence to inform urban designers and public space managers. This article discusses the methods used to examine streets as one of the most relevant types of public space in New Zealand. The methodology was deployed in two distinct stages, the first of which made use of ethnographic fieldwork and provided data on specific public spaces and their usage through a range of case studies. The second stage utilised online surveys to probe people’s preferences for a series of visualisations of street environments. Most research on public space design has to date been focussed on one or the other of these methods (field research or visual preference surveys). The combination of methods used in this research enables a deeper understanding of which public space attributes foster lingering and social activities among people from different cultural backgrounds. This methodology is feasible and comprehensive, clearly identifying the important relationships between design, use and preference in multicultural societies. The findings will be of interest to other researchers, urban practitioners and city officials. © The Author(s) 2020.","environment and behaviour research; Mixed methods research; multiculturalism; street design; visual preference surveys",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114952039

Using a survey of 1,048 individuals conducted in 2016 in Chengdu—located in a carefully conceptualized typology of neighborhood forms—we analyzed the associations between individual and neighborhood characteristics and active or non-motorized transport behavior. Using several multiple logistic and multi-level models, we show how neighborhoods were categorized and how the number of categories or neighborhood types affected the magnitude of the associations with active transport but not the direction. People taking non-work trips were more likely to use active compared with motorized modes in all neighborhood types. Neighborhood type was significant in models but so too were many other individual-level variables and infrastructural and locational features such as bike lanes and location near the river. Of the 3-D physical environment variables, floor area ratio (a proxy for density) was only significant in one model for non-work trips. Intersection density and dissimilarity (land-use diversity) were only significant in a model for work trips. This study shows that to develop strong theories about the connections between active transport and environments, it is important to examine different physical and cultural contexts and perform sensitivity analyses. Research in different parts of China can help provide a more substantial base for evidence-informed policymaking.

The course, based on his scholarship, argues that the best designed structures (bridges, buildings, and shells) are a work of art - structural art. The course integrates humanities with engineering through studies of cultures, people, and art as reflected in works of engineering. Professor Billington used alliterations to reinforce learning: The measures of structural art are efficiency, economy, and elegance; and the structural artist's designs evolve from imitation, to innovation, to inspiration. The authors are Princeton University faculty in who have continued teaching Billington's classic courses (imitation), enhanced it with modern pedagogical approaches (innovation), and created new classes and scholarship inspired by it (inspiration).

México is an exceptional setting for studying the interactions between humans and fungi, since most of the native cultures have interacted with these organisms for thousands of years. The state of Michoacán is particularly relevant, since nearly 11% of the fungi species recorded in Mexico occur there, 139 of which are edible. The aim of this study was to analyze the interactions of the Purépecha native communities with edible fungi and their environment, the position of mushrooms in the local worldview, and the classification system, management forms, and social and environmental problems associated with their use. Semi-structured interviews at regional markets were conducted. We conducted participant observation, proof interviews in harvesting areas, and workshops with the communities. Ethnoecological information was recorded for 21 edible fungi species and the environments where people interact with these mushrooms. People called hongueros (fungi handlers) identified the following environmental problems: A loss of local knowledge, a decreasing consumption of fungi among young people, land-use changes, the illegal extraction of forest resources, deforestation, unplanned urban growth, uncontrolled fires, livestock raising, and agricultural intensification. These issues affect fungi diversity, distribution, and abundance. All these factors, in turn, affect decreasing economic incomes associated with this activity and changes in the diets of the local people. Information from this study will help local authorities and people of the community to design management strategies for maintaining the environment and fungi, strategies which aim to contribute to the sustainable use of both fungi and forests. © 2019 by the authors.","Corpus; Ethnoecology; Ethnomycology; Kosmos; Michoacán; Praxis complex (KCP); Purépecha; San Francisco Cherán","detritus; ecology; edible species; fungus; nature-society relations; wild population; wildlife management; Mexico [North America]; Michoacan; Purepecha; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068941129

The development of social urbanism and universal design is an indicator of equality and justice, sustainability of urban life. The subject matter thus affects the scope of social work methodology, social services activities, and reflection of specialists on the inclusive approach as a strategy to reduce inequality, improve the quality of life and protect human rights. Inclusive culture turns out to be a social mobility strategy, an alternative to barriers forming temporal and mobile inequality. There was an opportunity to remove the limitations of the isolated consideration of urbanism issues as free from social meanings and Inclusive discourses, of social policy as a set of laws and regulations, a set of technologies that do not contain the realities of barriers and accessibility of the urban environment in the social life of people with limited mobility.

Identity is an important element of a nation to show who the citizens really are in the era of globalization. The existence of an urban kampong is often marginalized due to 'bad' infrastructure and social conditions. But a kampong as the residence of common people in the city center is also recognized as a successful place in reflecting human values. Kauman is a kampong where people live around the city's great mosque and demonstrate characters of a devout Muslim community in the Javanese traditional city. In Semarang Kauman is a pioneer of a city characterized by the social life of non-elite class, coastal Islamic culture, and trading activities. The role as a spiritual-religious area has been continually attached to Kauman since the Mataram Kingdom's era to the present despite different improvisation of developments. At this moment Kauman seems to experience the effects of Johar Market burning in 2016. As a kampong with stories of the history of the city's development, Kauman has many local cultures that potentially become a city identity. However, the condition of infrastructure and socio-cultural aspect appears to be in degradation due to aging and modernization-capitalization pressure from its surroundings. This research aims to explore the spatial phenomenon influenced by socio-religious aspect that makes Kauman able to survive with the identity of a 'religious spiritual' place. This research employed ethnographic methods. The results showed that socio-religious values influenced community's everyday life and encouraged the community participation in the making of place. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Kauman; Place; social cohesion","Commerce; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Community participation; Ethnographic methods; International development; Kauman; Place; Social cohesion; Social conditions; Spatial phenomenon; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060052839

Therefore, the commercial streets in its old downtown also showed very obvious diversity. Vietnamese people have adjusted the urban spaces planned by French people in order to match with their lifestyle for more than 100 years. Besides, many old commercial buildings have been demolished and replaced with new buildings, causing the disturbance of life and cultural values of the city, leaving many streets losing their original landscapes and getting the same style.

Design/methodology/approach: Data was obtained from a qualitative longitudinal panel study with three waves of individual interviews. A cohort of 51 young Danes, with varying levels of gambling involvement, were interviewed three times, with a 10-12 frequency from 2011 to 2014. In total, 149 interviews were conducted over the 4-year period. Findings: Enjoying social interactional effects appeared to be the main reasons young people engage in simulated gambling games. The study documented characteristics of both a catalyst pathway and a containment pathway emphasizing that for some young people simulated gambling may increase the likelihood of involvement in real money gambling while it may decrease it for others. Research limitations/implications: The sample was relatively limited and it involved participants from only one of the five Danish regions. The sample reflects the culture, rural/urban configuration and gambling market of a specific geographic region. Practical implications: Some forms of simulated digital gambling may provide players with excitement and unrealistic conceptions of winning chances, which, in turn, may encourage participation in real forms of gambling. This may call for regulatory policies aiming at the structural features of simulated gambling products and their rapid global spread. Consumer campaigns aimed at both young people themselves and their parents may be considered. Originality/value: Few studies have provided insights into the meanings and motivations of young people engaged in simulated gambling. The current study is among the first to explore adolescent’s experiences, motivations and behaviors vis-à-vis simulated gambling and the potential interrelationships between simulated and monetary forms gambling. © 2018, Søren Kristiansen, Maria Camilla Trabjerg, Nanna Reventlov Lauth and Anders Malling.","Adolescence; Consumer socialization; Longitudinal; Simulated gambling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051516195

The extension of intercultural contacts in the present-day world calls for a thorough study of what effect these contacts produce on the human personality. When an individual is suddenly immersed in a different culture, his or her consciousness becomes a battlefield where new values conflict with the old. The person experiences an axiological shock, a ""value clash,"" which urges him or her to undertake a re-examination of his/ her value system as a whole. Objective. The objective of this study was to determine the changes occurring in the value system of Vietnamese students obtaining their higher education in Russia. Design. A longitudinal study was performed involving 100 Vietnamese students in Russian universities. The measurement methods used in the study were: 1) the modified M. Rokeach Value Survey (Rokeach, 1973; Kudrjashov, 1992), in which the original set of values was expanded by 20 additional values typical of the Vietnamese people; and 2) the technique for assessing acculturation strategies developed by J.W. Berry (Strategii mezhkul'turnogo vzaimodejstvija..., 2009). Results. In the course of a year of residence in Russia, specific changes (or ""shifts"") occurred in the value systems of the Vietnamese students which proved to be statistically significant. Among the goal values (the same as terminal values, in the terms of M. Rokeach) which took on more weight were Productive Life and Materially Prosperous Life, while among instrumental values, Tidiness and Frugality became more prominent. A difference between the value dynamics in male and female students was also established, with the value pattern of male students proving to be more dynamic. The next finding was the difference in value dynamics between students coming from urban and rural settlements. There was one more quite unexpected finding: The value pattern changed more noticeably in respondents with an acculturation profile of ""Integration and Separation,"" than in those with profiles of ""Integration and Assimilation"" and ""Pure Integration."" Conclusions. Therefore we see that factors such as gender, type of environment (rural/urban) the individual comes from, and the strategy of acculturation used by the individual, act as mediators exerting their own influence upon the dynamics of his/her value patterns. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2018.","Acculturation; Acculturation profile; Acculturation strategies; Value dynamics; Value pattern; Vietnamese students",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055960342

Along the centuries, arts and crafts have always occupied an important place in the life of cities because they contribute to preserve local identity and traditions through skills, they provide jobs and contribute to the local economy, and they are a source of interest for cultural tourism. Historically, artisan workshops are to be found in cities, where the high concentration of people and products provides the perfect framework for buying raw materials and selling the final products in markets. Today, workshops have often been substituted by industrializations and those left are increasingly being forced out of the city or to die to leave space to new businesses. What is the place of handicraft today? Is there still a strong linkage between handicraft and places? And what has been the role of public policies in encouraging (or discouraging) this kind of activity in the past century? The article discusses these questions and provides examples taken from the observation of the historical and sociopolitical context of handicrafts in India.

In the past, the contradictory between city and rural areas in China had negative effects on rural construction, resulting in a slow development. The excessive focus on city design has led to the neglect of rural design. Blindly using the concept and method of city design to renewed the countryside is a kind of destruction to the countryside, and also wastes a lot of construction resources. Design is influenced by ethical concepts, which needs to pay more attention to the culture tendency and society. Urban design makes theoretical investigation aiming at the ethical questions that emerged from city, then summarizes the design strategies of the city. While Chinese rural design has only begun to enter people's horizon, and there is very little discussion about it. Due to the lack of ethical value guidance, Chinese rural design and construction has many problems at different levels of ecology, culture and industry. Therefore this paper primarily explores the domestic and foreign design ethics, attempting to provide a new perspective for Chinese rural design, aiming at finding a realistic and forward-looking solution for Chinese rural design concerning to the complex relation between city and rural areas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Philosophical aspects; Rural areas; Architectural features; Construction resource; Design and construction; Industrial structures; Natural landscapes; Organizational structures; Rural constructions; Theoretical investigations; Design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040747256

Narutowicza 11/12, Gdańsk, 80-233, Poland","The paper deals with the architecture of contemporary buildings in respect to their aesthetic image created by the use of natural light. Sustainability is regarded as a governing principle of contemporary architecture, where daylighting is an important factor as it affects energy consumption and environmental quality of the space inside a building. Environmental awareness of architecture, however, involves a much wider and more holistic view of design. The quality of sustainable architecture can be considered in its aesthetic and cultural context with regard to landscape, local tradition, and connection to the surrounding world. This approach is associated with the social mission of architecture, i.e. providing appropriate space for living, facilitating social relations and having positive impact on people. The purpose of the research is to study the use of daylight in creating an aesthetic image of contemporary buildings. The author focuses mainly on public buildings largely dedicated to art and culture which satisfy high functional and aesthetic requirements. The paper examines the genesis and current trends in the aesthetic image of modern buildings which use daylight as the main design strategy, focusing on the issues of glass facades. The main attention is given to the shaping of representative public areas which feature the glass facades. The research has been based on a case study, critical review of literature review, observation and synthesis. The study identifies and classifies different approaches to using daylight in these areas and highlights changes in the aesthetics of architecture made of glass, which uses daylight as the main design strategy. These changes are primarily caused by the development and spreading of new glazing materials and the use of digital method of design. The influence of light and its mode depends on glass materials but also on the local conditions of the site, and has a significant impact on the relationship between architecture and its natural and cultural environment. The subordination of architectural concept to the idea of natural lighting builds the relationship between form, function and the context of architecture, and is expressed in its structural, material and spatial properties, and in the resulting aesthetic order. Search for new architectural solutions is defined by local topographical, climatic, biological and cultural conditions. The architecture subordinate to the conception of contribution of light corresponds to the aesthetic aspirations of sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Energy utilization; Facades; Glass; Project management; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Architectural concepts; Architectural solutions; Contemporary architectures; Cultural conditions; Cultural environment; Environmental awareness; Environmental quality; Sustainable architecture; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033804253

In other words, it may also function as an open communal center that can build integrity and sense of belonging among the people since it acts to define the shape and ambience of a city and its neighborhood. Nonetheless, the design of public parks, especially in current urban areas are facing many problems due to factors such as unavailability of proper monitoring and management system to identify the level and trend of consumerism of public parks. Till present, there is no detailed study conducted to elucidate on the appropriateness of public parks design to meet the needs of local context. Henceforth, the objective of this paper is to study the context of existing public park in Malaysia and identify problems relating to design, management and effectiveness from user’s perception. To conduct this study, the research will adopt case study method as research strategy. Since the focus of this study is on social physical phenomenon and to understand how human social culture correlates with the design and management of public parks-two research paradigms which are interpretivism (hermeneutics) that translates human ideology and structuralism (semiotic) to read any physical structure or architectural design are adopted as research methodology. Data collection method will be from site observation, recorded documentation and questionnaires are used to gather all the evidences on the selected public parks design. Findings indicate that the design of local public parks failed to fulfill user satisfaction due to design imperfections and poor management. Therefore, this study will propose a suitable guideline as future reference to design a better and sustainable management for public park in the Malaysian context. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

It then extends this idea to higher scales, considering interfaces between city and region, which have already been theorised as 'mobility environments' (Bertolini & Dijst 2003) focusing on places and modal transfer points in new regional cities of high mobility. High-streets and mobility environments are both central places and our way of describing them suggests a new definition of central places as interfaces between normative (but also technically-infrastructually supported) political spaces (neighbourhood, city and region). It also clarifies the role of scale in place theory and we will deal with this in a following paper. Here we introduce ideas of 'modality places' and 'modality environments'. The 'modality environment' is concerned with areal and network transportation forms in whole fabrics and resulting conditions of sustainability and urbanity. Modality environments are understood in terms of transportation networks and the social and functional factors (like sustainability and urbanity) they produce. Modality environments are seen as lived environments built around movement infrastructure grids that distribute everyday urban functions. Ideally modality environments would be simple clear grids that distribute all or close to all the functions of everyday life so that a walking grid or a bicycle grid that gets adults to work, their children to school and includes shopping and recreation would be walking or bicycle modality environments. They would be expected to have high levels of direct visibility-legibility in the way urban elements present themselves to a mobile community. Modality environments would also include the central places (like high-streets or mobility environments like stations) at which people would transfer to other modality environments. We will use a notion of 'movement culture' to indicate the convergence of land uses and mobile communities mediated in information-rich networks. We are concerned first with how modality environments (for cycling or walking for example) may afford more sustainable lifestyles. We are concerned in addition with the ways they can be designed to include central places as zones of urbanity and vitality and as socially and culturally mixed centres. We start not with a principle of accessibility of/from nodes in an extensive space but with the idea that particular social and political territories (communities and polities) are already articulations of distinct modality environments. We demonstrate using the case of the Amsterdam metropolitan area.","Mobility environments; Modality environments; Urban design; Urban sustainability; Urbanity","Economics; Land use; Syntactics; Transportation; Urban planning; Metropolitan area; Modality environments; Network transportation; Public transport; Transportation network; Urban design; Urban sustainability; Urbanity; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031102615

The study aims to determine the level of interethnic tolerance/intolerance in 1st year students and development of their tolerant consciousness formation criteria. The methodological basis of the research is grounded on the concept of domestic and foreign pedagogy, cultural studies, psychology and sociology which consider multidimensional tolerance appearance as growing and dynamic phenomenon. Tolerance in this case acts as a subject of interdisciplinary study, as a phenomenon that integrates aspects of national cultures characteristics exploration by a personality. During the research the following methods were used: Analysis and study of scientific literature on the researched topic and its systematization, pedagogical and psychological monitoring of interpersonal relations in student groups; design and organization of educational process using the developed teaching materials; observation and analysis of interethnic tolerance formation in students through the study of ethnic culture of the people of Kazakhstan with a view to identifying good practices and shortcomings, questioning students, public opinion poll; at the end of the experiment the methods of experimental data processing, analysis and synthesis of the results were used.

A sustained community is one of the sustainable development agendas that encourage community involvement and participation in contributing to sustainability. Moreover, with the rapid population growth, especially in urban cities as the proportion of urban dwellers will reach two-thirds of the world population, this will lead to several problems including the social life changing intensely. Sustainable Cohousing is one of the suggested answers for an innovative form of neighbourly accommodation. Generally, Cohousing is formed by a group of people who are committed to living as a community and who actively participate in the design and operation to shape their own neighbourhood. Through this concept, the community can decide how they can implement sustainability principles in terms of social, economical and environmental terms in their neighbourhood. Therefore, it is important to bring back the sense of togetherness amongst the people and improve their social wellbeing through an effective neighbourhood. The objective of this study is to isolate the basic concept of Cohousing and to identify the conceptual framework of Sustainable Cohousing that may apply to improving the sustainable living in Malaysia. The research methodology was through identifying and reviewing the issues in existing literature on cohousing chosen from various dimensions, such as principles and elements, sustainable value, development model and so on, which can be suited with the Malaysian culture.

It is argued that water management systems should be circular metabolisms, where wastewater is mobilized as a nutrition source. The aim is to propose water-recycling strategies at a micro level that reflect this. However, water-recycling systems are dependent on a complex set of social factors as to their acceptance/refusal and correct/incorrect use by the end users. This is particularly the case in Ecuador, where a plethora of variations in climates and cultures means that each project is different. This study proposes a qualitative methodology for the development of water-recycling strategies, where semi-structured interviews are first carried out to determine the design parameters of the specific social context where the project is to be implemented. Based on this, a water-recycling system can be proposed that is more likely to be readily accepted by the end users. The paper works with four of case studies, where the methodology is applied in three rural communities and an urban suburb in the Napo province of Ecuador, located in the Amazonian region. The results show that there were distinct differences in the water recycling strategies that were considered most appropriate for each case study.

Social support plays a different role in homeless women's life, as gender culture often causes them to be exposed to more risks. The purpose of this paper is to identify homeless people's access to social support from their network members, with a comparison between men and women. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, a survey method was used with an administrated questionnaire. Participants were recruited from among the homeless people (men and women) who used the municipal social services in shelters and social service centers in Tehran. The main variables in this study included frequency of contact, social support, and gender. Findings - The results have shown significant differences between homeless men and homeless women in terms of frequency of contact and receipt of social support. Homeless women contacted their network members more often than did homeless men and also received more support. There seems to be a strong correlation between the receipt of social support and women's greater ability for social communication, as well as with traditional culture, which considers women to be weak and dependent so that they receive more support compared with men. The weakness of social support, especially among homeless men, requires serious attention; however, homeless women are not in a favorable situation either. Originality/value - The social networks of homeless people who usually live on the streets and in public places without permanent shelter are weak because of various reasons, including poverty, addiction, immigration, and divorce. The weakness of social support leads to an escalation of their vulnerabilities. Thus, it is necessary, in social policy and services, to improve the social network of high-risk people such as homeless people, which would help the rehabilitation process and reduce the probability of exposure to harm.","Frequently of contact; Gender; Homeless men; Homeless women; Social network; Social support",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990946570

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that ""in the Asia/Pacific region, [cardiovascular disease] has become increasingly prevalent in recent decades, and now accounts for about one third of all deaths"". One risk factor that can lead to cardiovascular disease is hypertension. Based on WHO data from 2008, hypertension is now a global problem affecting 27% of the population 25 years of age or older.The risk for cardiovascular disease also appears to be higher among people in urban areas. A recent United Nations population report indicates that in the next 40 years we could see an increase in the world's population by 2.3 billion people. The majority of these people will be residing in urban areas, particularly in developing nations. Between 2011 and 2050, ""the population living in urban areas is projected to gain 2.6 billion, passing from 3.6 billion in 2011 to 6.3 billion in 2050"". Population growth in urban areas is therefore not only projected to include the expected population growth but also expected to include a shift of rural population to urban centers and ""most of the population growth expected in urban areas will be concentrated in the cities and towns of the less developed regions"". This growth of urban areas has the potential to put enormous pressures on health care systems that are already struggling to cope with the rapid increase in diseases thought to be more prevalent in Western societies, such as cardiovascular diseases.Hypertension may be difficult to treat due to a number of factors. Globally, access to antihypertensive medications, hypertension screening, and access to medical care vary from one country to another. Lifestyle factors, such as salt and alcohol consumption, stress, smoking, body weight, and exercise, are risk factors for hypertension that may be influenced by culture, which can in turn support or hinder lifestyle decisions that could significantly affect blood pressure. Hypertension, however, is easy to detect. A trained person with access to a low-cost sphygmomanometer can detect abnormal blood pressures quickly; however, access to trained personnel is not universally guaranteed. Globally - according to one model of skilled health care worker density and total requirement offered for discussion by the Global Health Workforce Alliance and WHO - there could currently be an estimated shortage of over seven million skilled health care workers (midwifes, nurses and physicians), as measured against a theoretical density of skilled health care workers to population. The shortage of skilled health care workers in this model could grow to over 12 million by 2035 if the assumptions of the model and population growth estimates are valid. Through rapid urbanization the potential for inequities in access to healthcare is also increased.Over the last few years, a number of community-based blood pressure screening and education initiatives have been established. These initiatives have been created either as part of research, as part of community outreach programs by publicly funded agencies, or as part of an outreach by not-for-profit organizations with a particular interest in reducing cardiovascular disease in specific hard-to-reach populations. Several systematic reviews have been conducted to assess different models for delivering services to people living with high blood pressure to assess community-based programs with a focus on cardiovascular disease, and to assess effectiveness of community health workers (CHW) in a variety of settings. These systematic reviews point to the importance of distinguishing between different categories of health care providers, their training and their roles in program delivery when assessing studies for possible inclusion in a systematic review.In a systematic review of studies from the US by Brownstein et al. focusing on the effectiveness of community health workers (CHWs) in the care of people with hypertension, this category of health care providers went under many different names. Community health workers in this review were defined as ""any health workers who carried out functions related to health care deliver, were trained as part of an intervention, had no formal paraprofessional or professional designation, and had a relationship with the community being served"". One of the findings from this review was the wide variety of formal training of the CHWs. In other parts of the world, a CHW might be defined differently. In their review of CHW-based programs focusing on children's health, Bhattacharyya, Winch, LeBan and Tien found that ""in general CHWs are not paid salaries because the MOH (Ministry of Health) or donors do not consider salaries to be sustainable. Yet CHWs are often held accountable and supervised as if they were employees. Community health worker programs must recognize that CHWs are volunteers (emphasis in original), even if they receive small monetary or nonmonetary incentives. They are volunteering their time to serve the community"". One Canadian model for delivering a cardiovascular awareness program designed to reach older adults through their primary care provider is based on volunteers with basic training to perform blood pressure measurements and cardiovascular health information.In a global review of a wide range of public health and health promotion initiatives operated by lay health workers from 2005, Lewin et al. identified over 40 different names or terms for a lay health worker. However, the definition of a lay health worker used by Lewin et al. is very similar to the definition of CHWs offered by Brownstein et al. Lewin et al.'s systematic review was the only study with a global focus that was located that reviewed studies of programs with a cardiovascular component using lay health workers. In this study, the sample size of studies focusing on lay health workers and cardiovascular disease was small (N=3) and the results from two of the studies were inconclusive to the point where the authors felt they could not pool the results.While a lay health worker may or may not receive some compensation for their work, volunteers in higher income areas of the world such as in North America typically do not receive any compensation. Volunteers, as observed by Bhattacharyya et al., are common in many parts of the world, and in some areas they provide delivery of programs and services that reach hundreds of thousands of individuals. One challenge for this systematic review will therefore be to isolate those programs that are delivered by lay health workers or volunteers who receive little or no compensation and programs where staff is paid. The importance of this distinction is on one hand related to cost - as observed by Bhattacharyya et al., many organizations responsible for delivery of community-based programs do not have funding for salaried staff. On the other hand there might be other factors in the relationship between a community being served by a program and the staff delivering the program. One such factor could be linked to the role of the person delivering the program as either a paid health care professional or an unpaid lay health worker or volunteer.Through this proposed JBI systematic review, the reviewers will focus on community-based blood pressure screening and health information programs delivered by either lay health workers or volunteers. Previous systematic reviews have indicated that programs focusing on blood pressure reduction delivered in a variety of settings and delivered by a variety of health care professionals might lower blood pressure among program participants over time. This systematic review will be limited to community-based programs rather than hospital or research facility-based programs, and to programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers rather than programs delivered by paid community health workers, nurses or teams of health care providers under direction of a primary care provider. Compared to other recent systematic reviews which focused on studies with comparison groups and included few studies where lay health workers were involved, this systematic review will attempt to fill this gap in knowledge about programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers by focusing on non-randomized controlled studies which report blood pressure changes over time in programs targeting the general population. Community-based programs might have a variety of designs with a number of different interventions, and where possible these designs and interventions will be identified and subgroup analysis conducted as appropriate. It is hoped that this systematic review can extend the work by Lewin et al. by identifying additional studies globally, focusing on programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers but limited to studies reporting changes in blood pressure over time. Where possible, a meta-analysis of the changes in blood pressure over time among participants in these programs will be conducted.

Serving the basic needs for the inhabitants, it became the most industrial and modern city in the Netherlands. In 1940 the city centre located more than 20 cinemas, which basically had the function to amuse people, instead of having a cultural purpose. In only one day in May 1940, German bombs destroyed 28.000 houses, 24 churches, 13 hospitals, 60 schools, 12 cinema's and 2 theatres. During the 5 years of the German occupation the Rotterdam cultural protagonists invest money and ideas to resolve the lack of a cultural centre in the city. Soon after the ending of the war a multidisciplinary arthouse was realized with a cinema, a theatre, an art-gallery and a public bar. It was the place where artist, artlovers, intellectuals and politicians could meet. For a number of reasons this postwar cultural centre became the building Ons Huis (Our House), a cultural building in classical style that was financed by a rich harbor company owner. It was built in the beginning of the 20th century to educate children of harbor workers in craftsmanship, art and culture. Ons Huis became since the 30's already an alternative place for theatre and cultural flm screenings. With the extension of cinema 't Venster, Ons Huis became a multidisciplinary arthouse that played an important role in postwar exhibitions, debates and presentations on a higher cultural lever. Mainly through a playful and modern design by young architect Bakema in 1947, the 16 year older architect VandenBroek asked him to become his partner in his office, the follow-up of the world famous office Brinkman&amp;vdVlugt. Working as a complementary team they designed postwar architectural and urban icons in the new centre of the city. Now in 2014, 65 years after the architectural intervention, we can conclude that the modern intervention on the building was not only a first trail of a young and insolent architect. By breaking away parts of a classical building to win the aesthetics for its own contemporary design, he added the new program and complements also the aesthetics of the existing building. His contrast was a legal action and in his re-use policy the intervention became an invitation for the new progressive users. With the cinema extension and new multidisciplinary function of the building it played an important role in physical and social city development. In the 70s Lantaren 't Venster give birth to the first edition of Film International, which soon after became the International Film Festival Rotterdam, the biggest international and cultural event in the Netherlands. Although the arthouse function with its historical name Lantaren Venster is moved to a new contemporary building designed by Alvaro Siza, the existing building Ons Huis with Bakema's and later extensions still is an alternative and multidisciplinary platform for artist in the city centre. A smaller part of Bakema's interventions is physically still present and some are still in use. For the rehabilitation of his design and making visible the contrast of his and later interventions the building needs a good research to make visitors aware of the value of the layered heritage. At least the documentation of the first modern intervention can be used for education about early modern interventions and winning public awareness to sustain the exchange of opinions.",,"Exhibitions; Expansion; Theaters; Urban growth; Art and cultures; Cultural events; Film festivals; Good research; Legal action; Netherlands; New programs; Public awareness; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943557303

In doing so, I focus on learning what successors of the tradition think about the orthodoxy of their music and what they think is the ideal way to pass down cultural heritage. In addition, considering that cultural norms are socially constructed in the moment, it should be also examined what leads people to have such notions. Design/methodology/approach To achieve these purposes, I look at practices of handing down traditional folk music in Japan, developing five case studies of various ohayashi. I also analyze yosakoi, which is modernly arranged local folk music that is widely spread across the country in the form of community festivals. Findings The successors of traditions tend to consider tracing the roots of their music as an obligation. On the other hand, in the case of music with no exact origin, its successors seek to find their identities by learning lessons from local anonymous ancestors. Meanwhile, there are people who consider its economic value as a raison d'être for traditional music. Originality/value What gives originality to this chapter is that I adopt an approach, employing regional and urban sociology methods, of comparing the characteristics of the regions in which local folk music is based. Along with perspectives on macro social changes and the principle of music group formation, I also discuss the transformation of expertise in folk culture associated with the rise of institutional reflexivity.

How we order and imagine ourselves is revealed by the visible forms of our built environments. Cities are the ultimate material expression of human desire and design. They are also forces of energy and fields of tension that structure our everyday imaginings and activities. How we move, think, act, interact, create and maintain our lives is bounded by what cities provide us. How we make common-wealth and differentiate ourselves from others also determines what cities are and might be for us. This issue explores the urbanism that is Manila in all its vital contradictions. A mega-urban region of over 20 million souls, it is both dynamic and discordant, creative and destructive. Like most global mega-cities, Manila is dangerous to its own citizens – polluted, dense, violent, and poor, with inadequate and badly maintained infrastructure and public utilities, but it is also a fecund incubator of cultural ideas, projects and networks. This issue explore both sides of this Janus-faced city – its urbanism and its visual cultures. Two common threads run through the articles in this issue: first is the dialectic of private and public, and second is the cultural traffic that informs place-making across time through the constant movement of peoples around the world-system and in the ever-pragmatic syncretic and local appropriations of cultural ideas, traditions and artefacts into new configurations, stories and views. As these contributions take issue with visual culture, we have given pride of place to photos, images and artworks themselves. For, as our colleague, Eduardo de la Fuente, has observed in this journal's pages (2010), the sociology of art is more than a socio-aesthetics. It is also a chronicle of the experience, performance and movement of aesthetic objects lodged in and across institutions, traditions and collective consciousness. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

A large red hand, superimposed on the front page of a mock newspaper, reaches out to seize the hand of the reader in a gesture of solidarity. Inspired by the revolutionary graphics of the Russian avantgarde, Yanase's dynamic political poster agitating for social revolution exemplifies the deep interpenetration of high art and mass culture that was expanding the boundaries of artistic production during this time. The period between the end of World War I in 1918 and the beginning of the Asia-Pacific war in 1937, when Yanase was working, was a time of intense cultural and political foment in Japan.

Historian Jordan Sand has written that ""[a] familiar set of polarities typically serve to distinguish Meiji 'civilization' [bunmei] from Taisho 'culture' [bunka] as two moments in the development of the national character: Public Meiji/private Taisho, nationalist Meiji/cosmopolitan Taisho, self-sacrificing Meiji/self-cultivating Taisho, productionist Meiji/consumerist Taisho.""2 To be sure, what is designated as Taisho in this equation was already gestating in the final years of Meiji, particularly after Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, when it seemed to many that the nation had finally reached a level of parity with other world powers that could at least partially release its imperial subjects from a total dedication to the national mission of producing a ""rich country, strong army"" (fukoku kyohei). And this Taisho ethos of individualism, internationalism, and consumerism continued well into the early Showa period through most of the 1930s, even as Japan experienced a devastating economic depression and began to mobilize for war. By the late 1910s and early 1920s, impulses to Westernize, while still abundantly in evidence, were clearly less state-driven and less focused on national political goals. There was still widespread inspiration from cultural trends originated in the European, North American, and Russian contexts, but it constituted a more selective and interpretive adaptation that was conceived in relation to indigenous cultural models. Modernity in Japan was impelled by its own logic based on local contingencies; it paralleled rather than followed developments in the West.3 Moreover, despite an increasingly ideologically driven rhetoric of ethnic homogeneity, the Japanese were still in fact quite diverse in terms of regional location and class, not to mention the broadly differentiated experiences of men and women during this time, making it difficult to speak of a single Japanese experience of modernity. The interwar period saw a great degree of man-made and natural turbulence. Beginning with popular antigovernment riots after the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905, the Japanese people were increasingly inclined to bring their grievances into the public sphere through strikes and riots, most notably the Rice Riots of 1918, which highlighted the tremendous class inequalities that lay just under the surface of national solidarity. In the international arena, Japan's northern neighbor Russia experienced a bloody revolution in 1917 that brought social rebellion right to Japan's borders. Socialist and communist ideas that identified social ills as rooted in an exploitative class structure were already filtering into Japan from abroad, appealing to the working class and fueling political activism among the younger generation of the nation's intelligentsia, such as the talented painter Yanase Masamu. This awareness of social issues emerged among a broad range of artists, mostly based in major urban centers, which made them particularly sympathetic to leftist politics and strongly inflected their cultural production with a transgressive and contestative character. Right as the Taisho period was hitting its stride and modern times were in full swing, a mammoth earthquake on September 1, 1923, devastated the nation's capital of Tokyo, along with the bustling nearby cosmopolitan port city of Yokohama and a large swath of their surrounding areas. No one in the region was left untouched by the Great Kanto Earthquake, as the calamity soon came to be known. A vivid outpouring of grief, sympathy, nostalgia, anger, and samaritanism flowed from the artistic community, which labored to make sense of the shocking experience while actively assisting in the reconstruction effort. Their response resulted in a body of work that testifies to the potency of this traumatic event in the collective Japanese imagination. This was the dynamic and chaotic context into which many innovative Japanese art and design movements of the 1920s and 1930s were born. And it was precisely the transitional and unstable nature of the interwar period and the range of cultural possibilities it offered to artists and designers that fueled their imaginations, compelling them to push the envelope of cultural production. This included an unprecedented interest in more substantially integrating art into daily life, which increasingly brought high art aesthetics into the commercial sphere-a trend that would continue to influence the Japanese cultural field for decades to come. © 2011 by The University of Hawai'i Press.

I was interested in the cap because of the logo that it carried - one that depicted a soccer ball as the globe with the North and South American continents located between the letters C and A. In my naïveté, I thought it might have been a cap for a new North American soccer team; what sold me on the item was the enthusiasm of the clerk behind the counter. As it turns out, Club América is one of Mexico's most successful teams, having won ten professional championships. The country's other success story, Chivas has eleven titles to its credit. ""No me digas,"" I say (You don't say). ""De veras,"" she tells me (It's true). So, I buy the cap. It is a hot, bright August day; I put my new cap on to shade my eyes and walk over to the lonchera (taco truck) to get a plate of carnitas tacos (fried pork tacos). I chat with the cooks (""hace un calor hoy día⋯ the heat today""), I eat, and I get on with my day fully satisfied - hunger satiated, outfit complete. I spent this late weekday morning conversing in Spanish, tooling around a commercial landscape in which Spanish-language signage appears on every available surface, and listening to Spanish-lang uage radio. I am in Charlotte - Charlotte, North Carolina. My morning in Spanish may not seem particularly interesting to people who live in major North American urban centers like Los Angeles, New York, or even Atlanta, but for many North Carolinians, this represents a significant and unfamiliar trend. The landscape through which I traveled is essentially invisible to most Charlotteans; this is an area often overlooked and forgotten by many within greater Charlotte due to the area's aging auto-oriented infrastructure. As such, it does not exist within the mental maps of many of the city's middle- and upper-class residents whose lives are oriented around often newer suburban landscapes. This is now the terrain of immigrants, many of whom are Latino, and their permanent settlement has begun to reshape this and several other areas of Charlotte - a city better known for its namesake, Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, than for its thriving ethnic communities.1 In fact, the growing number of Latinos within the Queen City (as Charlotte is often called) and its surrounding areas has given rise to some very visible forms of resistance. For example, the Charlotte Observer reported the appearance of an A-frame commercial roadside placard that encouraged drivers to ""Honk if you hate Spanish.""2 The article ran at a time when increasing numbers of hate e-mails arrived at social service organizations catering to Latinos and English-only initiatives became fodder for city council debates. In Charlotte and many of its neighboring towns, the presence of a growing number of Latinos has given rise to a great deal of tension. This tension stems in part from the fact that immigration is a relatively new phenomenon in this city and region. The southeastern United States has not been a significant part of global migration patterns historically, but this has changed since 1990.3 In fact, southern states have experienced the country's most explosive Latino booms in the years between 1990 and 2005, during which Latino demographics experienced triple digit growth: 394 percent in North Carolina alone, while many neighboring states saw growth rates of over 100 percent.4 One result of this new immigration trend is that the largest percent increases occurred in what Roberto Suro and Audrey Singer have called ""new Latino destinations"" - cities such as Atlanta, Orlando, and Charlotte.5 In this sense, the Solid South is melting into the air of multicultural modernity in ways that challenge the region's long-standing black/white cultural binary.6 States such as North Carolina, therefore, must confront the ""complex nature of race relations in a post-civil rights era"" in which biracial frameworks are ""unable to grasp the patterns of conflict and accommodation among several increasingly large racial/ethnic groups."" 7 Despite resistance from some sectors of the local metropolitan population, Charlotte's Latino communities continue to grow. According to 2005 census studies, Latinos now make up approximately 10 percent of both Charlotte's and Mecklenburg County's total populations. Other estimates hold that the Latino populace is at least double what the official record claims, given the endemic under-counting in census reporting. This recent growth, which has helped push the total Latino population to over 4 percent statewide, has also contributed to emerging Latino cultural landscapes in several parts of the city.8 ""Mí reina (my queen),"" it seems, is becoming as common a phrase in some areas of town as ""Queen City"" is in others. Immigrant settlement (both permanent and temporary) has an impact on the social and physical landscapes of urban and suburban areas. Such impacts have been seen in places ranging from U.S. cities such as Los Angeles to European centers such as Duisburg-Marlox, Germany.9 One result of these impacts has been the transformation of existing urban landscapes in ways that meet the cultural needs of immigrants and that produce new urban borderland conditions. And, it is in these areas that one is able to observe how identity construction can inform spatial reconstruction as immigrants inhabit and engage in the production of place in specific areas. This chapter examines how the border is now inhabited in places far from geopolitical demarcations. Charlotte's relatively recent experience with Latino immigration puts in stark relief the emergence of a new set of border conditions that illustrate how space, place, and identity intersect within the contemporary transnational landscape. What one finds is a set of urban conditions previously unfamiliar to most southern cities - conditions of invisibility, of exile, of heterotopic spatiality, and of emergent or prototopic urbanism. Sites of invisibility often occur in existing but overlooked parts of the city such as the one described in the opening vignette of this essay; such spaces are often characterized as former centers of economic and social activity that have been surpassed by newer urban or suburban developments elsewhere. These sites become invisible to many simply because they fail to attract the attention of middle- and upper-income groups. Sites of exile may overlap with invisible spaces or exist in more publicly visible locations; these locations, such as a storefront church or a city park, emerge as socially symbolic sites for specific transnational communities. These spaces become hybrid landscapes in which immigrant sociospatial patterns mix with existing conditions to create a new cultural borderland. Heterotopic spatiality refers to the heterogeneous sociospatial life (represented by a mix of uses and activities much more complex than allowed by conventional mixed-use zoning) exhibited in many Latino immigrant landscapes in which a vibrant public culture thrives despite the fact that many of the activities found there would be defined as ""nonconforming"" by local planning codes. Prototopic urban-ism refers to the theoretical premise that the spatial characteristics found in immigrant landscapes represent a potential model for the reintroduction of fundamental aspects of urban life into aging auto-oriented areas. Each of these conditions will be explored further as interrelated parts of Charlotte's changing metropolitan landscape in order to identify urban characteristics that hold promise for the design of civic, public, and urban spaces. It is my contention that the sociospatial dynamics of Charlotte's Latino landscapes do not represent areas in decline, but, rather, the emergence of a vibrant model of economic regeneration that may hold lessons for the redevelopment of other aging urban spaces. These landscapes illustrate a form of grassroots or organic urbanity that cannot be captured by conventional planning, design, or development patterns. Of particular importance, and a significant characteristic that differentiates the landscapes explored in this chapter from mainstream planning norms, is rooted in the transnational and hybrid nature of such sites. Such landscapes illustrate how North American midcentury urban fabric becomes infused with Latin American cultural attributes, thereby resulting in a sociospatial condition that is both border town and Main Street usa si mu lta neou sly. © 2010 by University of Georgia Press.

From its founding, Philadelphia's unfolding futures were consistently dynamic, focusing the energies of colonial expansion, democratic governance, and industrialization in one urban crucible. No other city in America exhibited each trend so dramatically. It was the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876- with the glass and steel dome of its Memorial Hall, its displays of telegraphy and the telephone, its prototype steam automobiles-that first demonstrated to Americans what an industrialized nation might really look like. Ed Bacon was an enthusiast of world's fairs and public exhibitions, writing and speaking of them throughout his career to illustrate and promote trends in urban development, and working in the genre himself to advance a far-reaching planning agenda for Philadelphia in the postwar decades. Philadelphia emerged from World War II burdened by creaking infrastructure and a housing shortage, its Center City business district underperforming against rival cities. Deindustrialization was already noticeable by the mid-1950s, an emerging economic reality that foretold difficulty in achieving the social goals of a new and aggressive generation of reform-minded political leadership.1 Residents were embarking for the suburbs at a steady clip, with the city falling by 1960 from third to fourth in population behind Los Angeles.2 Bacon's 50-year vision projected against this backdrop might have struck the reader as cheerful but unrealistic, even naïve. But what good is a prophecy if it does not reveal a hidden future, a future obstructed? Bacon's future was a city revitalized, beautified, and modernized in time to host the nation's Bicentennial celebration and a simultaneous 1976 Philadelphia World's Fair. Imaginative planning was his method, enabling the political gatekeepers along with the citizens of the city to see with him decades ahead and to grasp the occasion of a fair to accomplish lasting change for the city's built environment and its people. ""Philadelphia in the Year 2009"" builds its case on this one powerful idea: A world's fair could transform it into a model of humane urbanism.3 Considering his vantage point in 1959, it is possible to imagine why Ed Bacon might predict the future of Philadelphia with such mesmerizing flourishes. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC), under his directorship, was in the midst of one of the longest winning streaks any urban planning body had or has ever achieved. With Penn Center, Society Hill, Independence Mall, the neighborhoods of Eastwick and the Far Northeast each underway or finished, Bacon and his team of young planners were totally in their stride in 1959, working to think, dig, and build the city out of its rut. The Market East transportation center, a pedestrian-friendly Chestnut Street, and a tourist-friendly Delaware waterfront were all on Bacon's drawing board, too. These were the varied pieces, described in turn by each of the authors in this volume, of a full urban-renewal portfolio advanced consistently over more than two decades by the PCPC. Postwar federal legislation enabled city officials for the first time to broadly exercise eminent domain powers, moving masses of residents and bulldozing whole sections of the city, planning and building anew.4 Ed Bacon's PCPC was certainly of its time in this respect and forceful in its place, stirring up both wonder and backlash. The old industrial city, the city that had lain fallow through the Depression and World War II, was awakening slowly to the possibility of highrises and integrated transportation hubs, and at the same time rediscovering its walkable character and the vernacular beauties of its historic neighborhoods. Bacon's idea was to liberate William Penn's grid from over a century of industrial-age clutter and to make the city simultaneously auto-, pedestrian-, and investment-friendly. Bacon understood the power of display and salesmanship as keys to making his idea of the next Philadelphia into something tangible. In this spirit, his ""2009"" essay arrived on newsstands in 1959. Could new high-rises and a suburban-style shopping center downtown reverse massive job losses and a suburban exodus? Whether the PCPC's projects were comprehensive enough remained an open question in 1959. In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The ""2009"" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's ""2009"" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the ""master planner"" and by extension New Deal/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian ""Philadelphia in the Year 2009."".

They viewed these as facets of a broader existential problem: alienation. Everyday life was characterized by boredom, predictability, and powerlessness, and lacking opportunities for creativity or adventure. They believed urbanism offered great potential for emancipation and revolution. Their ambition was to stimulate the raising of everyday consciousness, and the ongoing development of new, unalienated ways of living focused around play, through the reappropriation and recuperation of urban space, culture, politics, and technology for everyday use and to enable the expansion of people's desires. They critiqued zoning, traffic planning, the banishment of Paris's poor to the suburban periphery, and the social segregation of new towns, and proposed instead unitary urbanism as an ongoing, playful, lived critique of modernist cities.

In the process, images and cultural representations are created and reinterpreted within the socioeconomic and ideological postulates of the tourism rationale. At the same time, the phenomenon of tourism exemplifies the dissolution of cultural boundaries, examined by many as the product of globalizing currents. ""Crises of representation"" has become a very popular expression among postmodernist discourses, within which it embeds the multiple meanings and symbols encapsulated in the unbordered nature of our cultural world (Lyotard 1984; Jameson 1984; Harvey 1991; Marcus and Fisher 1986; Said 1978). The conceptual arena of this study is framed within this unbordering milieu applied to current globalizing trends, tourism and migration. The focus of the study is the analysis of the phenomenon of tourism development in Mexico and the outmigration process among Maya communities in the Yucatán Peninsula. The analytical window of the ethnographic data is centered on the concepts of labor and production and how these are transformed due to the articulation of migration and tourism. Mexico greatly satisfies the global demand for vacationing in exotic places; in particular, the Caribbean region provides tourists with the uniqueness of the sand beaches and water colors. Cancún is the most acclaimed tourist emporium in this region. Although Cancún represents American- style entertainment in an exotic landscape for many, it also becomes the gateway to Maya culture. Waitresses dressed with huipiles (traditional female Maya dress), pyramid- shaped hotels, and shopping malls spiced with pre- Hispanic Mayastyle paintings and sculptures are a few among the many remainders of the connection between Cancún and Maya culture. The Maya community of Chan Kom and the international tourist emporium of Cancún are the two major cultural landscapes in this study. Although Chan Kom and Cancún are embroidered in the same current globalizing fabric, each represents different cultural contexts. Chan Kom is located at the heart of the north- central part of the Yucatán Peninsula and is flanked by two impressive archaeological sites. It is located about 14 kilometers south of Chichén Itzá and about 90 kilometers west of Cobá. Chan Kom is located 9 kilometers off the Mérida- Cancún highway, 132 kilometers from Mérida and 290 kilometers from Cancún. Cancún represents a complex tapestry of different ethnic groups, social classes, and nationalities that color the multicultural composition of our international tourist world. Fascinated by the opportunity to experience the tropical exoticism, thousands of tourists visit Cancún annually. At the same time, attracted by the opportunity ""to advance,"" ""to modernize,"" and ""to prosper,"" hundreds of Maya move to Cancún to become the underlying base of labor for the development of tourism. Tourists and Maya have to cross different cultural and socioeconomic borders in order to experience Cancún. In their travels, tourists and Maya migrants bring their cultural packages with them, and they learn, from each other, to conceptualize the value and position of ""culture"" within the capitalist code of consumption. Through their experiences as migrants in Cancún, Maya learn the crucial role that Maya cultural ""authenticity"" plays in the economic success of the tourism enterprise. Tourist brochures depicting the turquoise waters and the white sand beaches are quite often framed by pyramids, chacmols (reclining figures with flexed knees), and other representations of the glorious ancient world of the Maya. With this, tourists are symbolically invited not only to enjoy the paradisiacal landscape of Cancún but also to consider it as the entrance to the ancient Maya culture. Most tourist vacation packages include visits to major archaeological sites such as Tulum and Chichén Itzá. This has promoted the proliferation of artisan stands not only within the archaeological sites but also along the way to the sites. The communities nearest to Chichén Itzá (i.e., K'aua, Piste, X- Calacop) have specialized in the production of wooden sculptures, replicas of ancient Maya designs for tourist consumption. The knowledge acquired as migrants in Cancún- what can be considered ""human capital""-is invested in the planning of economic strategies for local development, mainly focused on the exploitation of cultural attractions for the tourist clientele in Chan Kom. Inspired by Edward Said's Orientalism (1978), some studies denounce the culture of tourism as a new form of colonialism (Nash 1995). Indeed, many indigenous people have come to view tourism as a ""new form of sugar"" (Rajotte 1987), that is, a new form of exploitation of the indigenous populations by external forces. Other studies emphasize the detrimental impact of tourism among indigenous communities, particularly in the loss of ""authenticity"" of culture. However, these critiques render ""culture"" as static and deny people their history (Greenwood 1989). In contrast to these positions, the present study explores the unbordering global condition of our world as it is expressed in Cancún's tourist ideology. Cancún is sustained by the infrastructural support of Maya migrant labor and legitimized by the international tourist ideology as a search for the ""exotic other."" This framework brings Chan Kom's and Cancún's cultural realms into dialogue and negotiation. Certainly, the tourist culture embeds rules of production and consumption radically different from those encapsulated in the milpa (cornfield) ideology that Maya experience in their communities. The dialogue between Cancún and Chan Kom cultural ideologies has different outcomes. Most peasants in Chan Kom reject Cancún influences by elaborating folk stories denouncing the urban dangers. On the other hand, migrants survive in Cancún by ""Mayanizing"" it, utilizing the ideological basis of their peasant Maya background. And the current political leaders in Chan Kom, with a long experience as successful migrants in Cancún, utilize their human capital to plan local development strategies. With this, Chan Kom's political leaders adapt the lessons in ""culture"" consumption learned in Cancún's international tourism market to their community's life. Thus, this analysis focuses on Chan Kom's social fragmentation, provoked by outmigration to Cancún, which cannot be understood without the interconnection between the social realms of Cancún and Chan Kom. © 2008 by University of Alabama Press.

Changes associated with urban growth often involve the destruction of built characteristics and natural elements, eradicating the physical expression of former indigenous ways of life that are a very important part of people's culture. This fact was particularly evident after the Second World War, when industrial landscapes faced deep transformations that in several cases contributed to its dereliction and to the disappearance of numerous industrial values, commonly known as industrial heritage. This phenomenon added to the necessity of reusing abandoned industrial landscapes in detriment of consuming new ones, increases the need to enlarge the interpretation of the term ""cultural heritage"", to analyse and interpret the value and significance of post-industrial landscapes and to develop new mechanisms to preserve it. Furthermore, it is increasingly acknowledged that the values connected with culture and heritage are highly significant for people's lives and need to be identified and highlighted. This paper presents a set of design principles that will be applied to the post-industrial landscape of left margin to the Arade River.

Grant and Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil entered Machinery Hall to open the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Since early morning, the day's 186,000 attendees had been streaming through the gates. The president and the emperor stood in front of thirteen acres of motionless machinery, all connected by pulleys, shafts, wheels and belts to the giant Corliss engine in the central transept. Several hundred invited guests, already waiting there, made room for the ceremonial party to climb upon the concrete base of the huge metal monster towering forty feet above their heads almost to the trussed roof of the Hall. Machinery Hall was one of five major buildings put up by exhibition organizers in Fairmount Park; outside groups built dozens more. The Main Building was the largest in the world at the time-over a third of a mile long. Visitors marveled at the items on display: A typewriter, Hires root beer, the Statue of Liberty's torch, the Westinghouse air brake, Fleischmann's yeast, cable from the Brooklyn Bridge, Bell's telephone, and Otis's elevator.2 The Centennial was a resounding success, dramatically displaying Philadelphia's wealth and industrial might. Over nine million people-nearly one-fifth of the country's population-attended before its close in November. It was the first international exposition held in the United States and probably the single most important cultural event of its era. Foreigners flocked to Philadelphia-inaugurating mass tourism to the United States-to see American industrial innovations and dozens of foreign exhibits from Britain, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Japan, China, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and ""two large Arab tents."" This influx of visitors and national cultures also opened Philadelphia andthe United States to a world of new influences; the Japanese exhibit in particular stirred an Oriental design fashion in the United States.3 Beyond the pomp, the fanfare, the hotel receipts, and the visitors, the Centennial also helped restructure the city's politics. The event both cemented networks of alliances among previously divided elites and marked the ascendance of a Republican hegemony in local political culture that would be virtually unchallenged for the next sixty years. The Republican regime that coalesced in the 1870s combined several elements: party bossism centered in control of several city agencies, an electoral machine that came to trade votes for public construction contracts, business support based in ideological solidarity (support for protectionist legislation), and reliance on rail- And port-related industries as the engine of the city's economy. In Philadelphia's case, the irony is that those Republicans who did the most to make the Centennial happen-large, reformist civic organizations like the Union League that played crucial roles in event planning and in promoting commitment to the Republican Party-did not necessarily enjoy the political fruits of their labors. Over time, the elite's cultural and ideological commitment to Republicanism became a straitjacket, and they lost control of the polity they had helped build. More broadly, I use the example of the Centennial to examine the role that cultural projects play in urban governance. These projects, and the planning efforts that produce them, contribute to the emergence and consolidation of governing regimes out of situations of extreme political discord and fragmentation. They connect processes of elite network formation (social capital) and ideological consolidation. These two processes in turn are the building blocks of hegemony in local governance-cultural and social leadership that shapes people's political commitments and the extent to which they are willing to consider or pursue alternatives to prevailing arrangements. © 2006 by Temple University Press.

The industrial civilization had long depended on carbon based technology. Building industry is a major area to have most of the energy drain. The sprawling cities, typical 20th century's practices have the major blames on producing waste gases that are affecting our environment. The carbon based global economy dominates our daily life. The already oversized Ecological Footprint for most of developed countries, plus continuing using the non-renewable energy resource based technology, not only pay a heavy price on our environment and could lead to global ecological collapse. Taking China as an example, China has strived for their modern image for the past decade. People want to copy western living styles, for instance, wider roads; garden houses, landscaping villages and high rises blocks in order to catch up with the modern living in the West. Copying the West despite great climatic difference, not only destroy the harmony between the culture and the nature, at the same time overuse the energy resources, in consequence self-destruct the environment. Destruction of huge parts of agricultural land in China in the past two decades and contamination of farm lands by all kinds of industrial waste are results from boom of manufacturing industry. China has paid high prices on the environment in exchange to the fast economic development. Air and water quality are poor, water shortages had already challenged the 1.3 billion people in China. This paper bases on proposals to Ningbo, a city along China's east coast in Zhejiang Province among only in academic circle, not yet being discussed among officials, on how successfully utilizing renewable resources in city's strategic planning and in the building design. This requires knowledge on waste treatment and on balancing resource management. At the same time, it takes into consideration of cultural, traditional factors in Ningbo. How vernacular forms of building design or urban pattern could find their perfect fits with China's rapid economic development will also be discussed in this paper.","Eco village and eco building; Sustainable city","20th century; Agricultural land; Building design; Building industry; Carbon-based; Daily lives; Developed countries; East coast; Eco-building; Ecological footprint; Economic development; Energy drain; Farm land; Global economies; High price; High rise; Manufacturing industries; Non-renewable energy resources; Renewable resource; Resource management; Sustainable cities; Urban patterns; Waste gas; Water shortages; Zhejiang Province; Carbon; Construction industry; Economics; Energy resources; Rural areas; Waste treatment; Water quality; Water supply; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865718225

It argues that introducing quantitative measures such as daylight level alone may not result in a ""healthy and functional"" kitchen without appreciating or factoring-in the impacts of the social roles and user expectations of kitchens in high-rise and compact urban situations. Design/methodology/approach - The study investigated three common types of apartment buildings in Hong Kong. Case studies suggested that it is crucial to include in a design process proper considerations of human behaviours byway of preferred approaches andmodes of living, space usage, andweightings of end-user responses that would influence architectural design in a direct and crucial way. Findings - The study noted that daylight quality of a kitchen is perceived by most families to be not as important as building control officials and designers thought it would. Instead, it is found that social and cultural factors are more important parameters for users. The study observed that designers rely on physical and quantitative approaches such as daylight factor, window size and window-to-room area ratio to qualify a design solution and ignore the socio-cultural parameters. Originality/value - The paper calls for designers and building control officials to incorporate the study of functionality and socio-cultural preferences of users groups in the building design process. The study envisages that an integrated design methodology would enhance the living environment.","National cultures; People's Republic of China; Residential property; Rooms; Socialization; Structural design","National cultures; People's Republic of China; Residential property; Rooms; Socialization; Architectural design; Building codes; Social sciences; Structural design; Kitchens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746629484

Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC V6B 5K3, Canada","""Better information for better cities!"" is the call that leads this special issue. Urban indicators and performance measurement are the answers, aiming to improve local performance on key trends and contribute to solving global problems. Better information, according to the rational model that predominates in urban policy, is the surest path to improve action. The World Urban Forum (WUF) III, meeting in Vancouver in June 2006, considers dimensions, challenges, and practices in the use of urban indicators in the Vancouver region. Patrick Geddes, writing in the early days of the town and regional planning movement, insisted upon the value of what he called a synoptic view, ""a seeing of the city and this as a whole; like Athens from its Acropolis"" (Geddes, 1949, p. 6). Working from a synoptic view did not simply mean gazing down on the city from atop a hill. Geddes strove to help people express ""simultaneity"" of their own being. Understanding that people living in a given region have a multitude of different perspectives, simultaneity of being meant ""one-ness with the social ideals, the scientific developments and the physical conditions of [their] own time and place"" (Geddes, 1949, p. x). He believed a region could be created and planned to aid people in accomplishing all these things. As one of the forefathers of town and regional planning, Geddes himself was a maker of ""great maps and diagrams and charts"" (Geddes, 1949, p. xiii)-but his most lasting contribution to the profession and practice of planning was his notion of the Civic Exhibition. Geddes was less concerned about expert training to make great plans and planners than he was ""concerned that the ordinary citizen should have a vision and a comprehension of the possibilities of his own city"" (Geddes, 1949, p. xi). A periodic Civic Exhibition, during which citizens could gather in a festive atmosphere to peruse plans, gaze at large maps and models, discuss and interpret these publicly, was one part of Geddes's key contribution to this goal. The other part was his drive to create a permanent and public centre for Civic Studies in every town in the form of an ""Outlook Tower""(Geddes, 1949, p. xi). The Outlook Tower was to be the ""incipient Civic Observatory and Laboratory together"" in which the Science of Cities was advanced to its proper rank amongst academic and life pursuits (Geddes, 1949, p. 96). The institution Geddes sought to create placed ""its effort towards correlation of thought and action, science and practice, sociology and morals, with its watchword and endeavour of ""Civic Survey for Civic Service"""" (Geddes, 1949, p. 69). Fastforward to late 2004, when the Urban Studies Program at Simon Fraser University's downtown campus initiated the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu), with a vision akin to that of Geddes. In the context of the new millennium, RVu was established as the first local observatory within UN-Habitat's Global Urban Observatory network in a developed country. The Global Urban Observatory was established in 1997 to institutionalize UN-Habitat's pioneering work in the generation and tracking of urban indicators, initiated with the Urban Indicators Programme in 1993. Following the creation of the Habitat Agenda at the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul in 1996, the mission was set for the Global Urban Observatory-to create and maintain a Global Urban Indicators Database that would permit UN member states and their cities to monitor and report on urban trends on a regular and reliable basis. The Millennium Development Goals, established by UN member states in 2000, and the indicators established for tracking these eight goals in 2003, update the mission of the Global Urban Indicators Database (UN-Habitat 2004). The MDGs represent a global compact for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, to be attained by 2015. RVu's work to date is being presented to the international community for the first time at the World Urban Forum III. The work thus far has constituted both expert-based and public participatory components. Experts affiliated with RVu have conducted regional and international research on urban indicator-related work, with some bearing on the Vancouver region and on specific indicators used by a range of projects in the major areas of urban capital: health, economy, environment, governance, culture, and infrastructure. Work in progress toward these research articles was presented at the first RVu public event, Focusing ouR View, in October 2005; and the best finished results are presented in this issue of Cities. Keys to the design of Rvu, and in particular its public participatory process, are presented in the first article in this issue, Urban Indicators and the Integrative Ideals of Cities, by Meg Holden. The paper presents the practice in progress of RVu's stance on urban sustainability as a community-based struggle to learn, indicators as a means for long-term learning, and the role of value-based citizen participation, within a theoretical perspective. Sustainable development, as a framework for long-term planning, has value in the Vancouver region for its ""constructive ambiguity""(Robinson, 2004, p. 374), its pointers toward greater linkages among environmental, social, and economic priorities, without forcing a premature set of quantitative trade-offs. This integrative, vague, idealistic thrust also leaves sustainable development open to clashes with incremental, specific, and realist demands competing for time on the public agenda. Indicators can help bridge the gap; the articles in this issue begin to explain how. One article presents a bridge from the perspective of environmental economics, illustrating the complexities of measuring natural capital but also the need and precedent for this. The next article presents a way of thinking about indicators of governance for sustainable development from a starting point of allocating equal value to democratic inclusion of each citizen. Moving from the individual to the group, the final two articles ask for greater attention to socially, culturally and demographically-specific cases: new immigrants and Aboriginal people. Nancy Olewiler offers an economist's perspective on the design and utility of an urban indicator project, with a particular focus on natural capital. Her article, Environmental Sustainability for Urban Areas: The Role of Natural Capital Indicators, expands on one of the themes from Holden, the difference between descriptive indicators, which proliferate in policy contexts, and diagnostic indicators, which are rare. Olewiler presents the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and reminds us of the need to consider different indicators at each point in the chain. Her treatment of natural capital indicator issues locally includes useful information on Greater Vancouver's adjacent Fraser Valley Regional District. She looks south to the city of Santa Monica, California for an example of natural capital indicator development and institutionalization. Building on a theme introduced by Holden, Olewiler reminds us that indicators alone are not enough; effective indicators are those presented in a reasoned context with a clear path to actions. Indicators belong at the beginning, not the end, of a good governance process. The next article specifies much more clearly what might be meant by the notion of good governance. In Designing Good Urban Governance Indicators: The Importance of Citizen Participation and its Evaluation in Greater Vancouver, political scientist Kennedy Stewart makes the case for inclusion of governance considerations in any definition of sustainability. The political aspect of sustainability is poorly developed, compared to economic, environmental, and social aspects and this article moves the thinking ahead through treatment of democratic theory, along with work on defining 'good governance' advanced by the United Nations. Stewart draws on evidence of voting patterns in the Vancouver region to raise the spectre of systematic disenfranchisement, that seems to be on the rise. As Canada's only unamalgamated major metropolitan region, led by municipal appointments rather than direct elections, advances in sustainable development policy made by the Greater Vancouver Regional District are at risk if voting trends cannot be reversed. Stewart calls for stepwise moral reasoning, based on the premise of universal equal rights to rectify this wrong. The final two articles examine the limits of belonging to the project of sustainability in the Vancouver region, from the perspective of the region's newest residents and its ancestral residents. Robert Fiedler, Nadine Schuurman and Jennifer Hyndman, in Hidden Homelessness: An Indicator - Based Approach for Examining the Geographies of Recent Immigrants At-Risk of Homelessness in Greater Vancouver, focus on the dimensions of risk of homelessness amongst one particularly vulnerable group, new immigrants. This investigation brings to the fore the interaction of policies, economics, and cultures in explaining the complexities of homelessness and immigration trends in the region. Since about half of the region's population growth in the foreseeable future will come from international immigration, and an increasing proportion of new arrivals face socio-economic difficulties upon arrival, understanding these interactions is key to sustainability in a context of increasing cultural diversity and decreasing affordability of housing. First Nations researcher Nathan Cardinal puts an Aboriginal lens on indicators in his concluding article, The Exclusive City: Identifying, Measuring and Drawing Attention to Aboriginal and Indigenous Experiences in an Urban Context. Along with immigrants, Aboriginal groups constitute fast growing demographic cultural groups in British Columbia.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646492639

This analysis provides insight into humans' emotional responses to the environment that is provided for them. Jordan's four pleasures model, composed of physio-, socio-, psycho- and ideo-pleasures, is used to undertake this analysis. From this analytical process it is evident that physio-, socio- and psycho-pleasures are drawn from generic elements that relate to humans as a kind, and that these commonalities are deeply rooted historical and cultural reference points. Understanding these reference points, and the design principles that emerge from them, will enable those who provide the built environment to engage with the 'super-usability' imperative that these pleasure-based approaches have been drawn from and, in so doing, to develop human-centric solutions that engender positive relationships between people and the environment that is provided for them. However, in the absence of a 'market', one area will remain problematic - that of personalised and individually constructed ideo-pleasure.","Design methods & aids; Town & city planning; Urban regeneration","Architectural design; Social aspects; Urban planning; Cultures; Design methods & aids; Town & city planning; Urban regeneration; Civil engineering; regeneration; urban development; urban planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25844509827

The City is on the shores of Port Phillip Bay, and has a population of over 80,000 residents. It is a mixed use area of houses, apartments, offices, retail areas and industry, with an emphasis on leisure and tourism attractions, drawing visitors from locally and overseas. It has a strongly defined urban heritage, a community committed to arts and culture and a diverse socio-economic demography. Gentrification and rising property values have altered the physical and social character of the municipality in recent years. The Council places a high priority on Cultural Vitality, Social Equity and Environmental Responsibility; three of the four 'pillars' of its Corporate Plan. This paper describes measures taken by the Council since 2000 to effectively integrate its range of environmental initiatives with programs to enhance the social well-being and connectedness of its citizens. It emphasises the importance of integrating programs that primarily address one element of the Corporate Plan but which, by proper planning and project management, can have beneficial synergies with others. Specific reference is made to programs that the Council has recently or is currently undertaking, including: Sustainable Design Strategy, and its implementation through the planning permit process, The Sustainable Living at Home Program (SLAH), in which households work co-operatively to reduce their 'environmental footprint', in terms of energy and water consumption, travel behaviour, purchasing practice, etc., Sustainable Community Progress Indicators (SCPI), a community based program which measures how we are progressing to a more social environmentally, culturally and economically sustainable community, ""margins, memories and markers"", a unique, State-funded program to improve mental health by enhancing peoples' connectedness with 'place' and community via story-telling and art installations, and Design-Ins and other consultation initiatives, which aim to include all sectors of the community in the development of more convivial and effective public places. The paper concludes with the contention that sustainable cities can be more readily achieved if local governments take a holistic approach to the integration of physical, cultural and social measures to enhance the lifestyles of residents, workers and visitors.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644230444

The proposed methodology was tested with the design of a Smart Village in Egypt, awarded the second prize in an international competition. Our design approach is based on environmental and social sustainability and works as a genetic algorithm. This process generates the sustainable architecture of the village using the behaviour of biological creatures in artificial systems. The design ultimately ensures that our architecture is nurtured by renewable energies and built with re-cycled materials. The disposition of public spaces and the flexible organization of different functions are conceived in order to stimulate social sustainability, allowing the community to be interdependent as much as an ecosystem. Local cultures, typologies, materials and climate build the DNA of both the village and its buildings. We apply concepts from artificial life, using ""creatures"" that follow simple low-level rules in order to get high-level group behaviour. By combining the principles of artificial life and architecture, we get both high energy-efficiency and optimal placement of built units on a specific site. As in any ecosystem, a fractal, coherent, continuous fluctuation at every scale of the system is vital, and this kinetic flexibility is achieved at four levels: 1) decentralized urban planning; 2) reconfigurable spaces; 3) modular building blocks; 4) kinetic structures that respond to light, climate and people.",,"Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Fractals; Genetic algorithms; Social aspects; Urban planning; Adaptive architecture; Flexible organization; Kinetic flexibility; Social sustainability; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544331353

System theory sees the building as a climate modifier (a filter), a behavioral modifier (Container of activities), a socio-cultural modifier (aesthetic object and symbol of cultural identity), and a resource modifier (cost). The above mentioned building functions have constituted the framework of the ""sustainability"" issue which was held in the U.N. Rio conference in 1992. This study argues, ""sustainable systems"" as an issue of traditional urban forms which has been regarded as optimum, impressive and objective solutions to design problems under the constrains of extreme climates, with limited technologies and materials available. These forms have long been seen as a model for the integration of architecture and society where a mode of living in symbosis with natural life has been established. The social classes constructing communities, the culture, the social behaviour of the communities, effect in different scale in forming their environments, this will give a different identity to a community. This paper, therefore aims to critically examine the concept of tradition/sustainability/identity and assess objectively to the traditional urban street façades located in several gcoghraphic regions of Anatolia. Anatolia displays a rich variety in terms of its architecture and urban structure not only because of its geographical location but also because of the influences of several civilisations varying from the remains of ancient Hittite and Urartean to the archaeological ruins of the Hellenistic period and the post Roman period, the manifest vestiges of Christian/Byzantine age, and the manifestations of the Seljuk and the Imperial Ottoman periods. Antalya, Ankara, Bursa, Erzurum, Diyarbakir, Niǧde, Trabzon and Urfa citadels are selected as sample areas that have distinct architectural forms and urban patterns originating from Roman, Byzantine, Arabic, Turkish traditions, still reflecting the characteristics and the segmented labyrinthine urban texture that bears the marks of the Ottoman period. Examining 1) the typological variety of the urban street façades and 2) the identifications of the specific and distinctive characteristics of the selected citadels of Anatolia which reflect the richness and density of its social, economic, cultural environment will contribute considerably to the richness of the urban design knowledge.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8444233309

Such exploration provides a basis for reconnecting urban designs with their cultural contexts, thereby promoting spatially expressed localism. Especially for Gianyar City, respect for religious systems, beliefs, and religions that have developed and are highly trusted by the public is expressed in symbolic elements that are embodied in the composition of space, and in fact, give rise to the concept of uniformity. This condition resulted in not achieving a more prominent urban cultural identity and being further damaged by the highly standardized process in the Indonesian planning system.

The smart city concept has changed the urban ecosystem by embedding digital technologies in the city fabric to enhance the quality of life of its inhabitants. However, it has also led to some pressing issues and challenges related to data, privacy, ethics inclusion, and fairness. While the initial concept of smart cities was largely technology-and data-driven, focused on the automation of traffic, logistics and processes, this concept is currently being replaced by technology-enabled, human-centred solutions. However, this is not the end of the development, as there is now a big trend towards “design for values”. In this paper, we point out how a value-sensitive design approach could promote a more sustainable pathway of cities that better serves people and nature. Such “valuesensitive design” will have to take ethics, law and culture on board. We discuss how organising the digital world in a participatory way, as well as leveraging the concepts of self-organisation, selfregulation, and self-control, would foster synergy effects and thereby help to leverage a sustainable technological revolution on a global scale. Furthermore, a “democracy by design” approach could also promote resilience. © 2021 by the authors.

This genius loci or ‘collective spirit of place’ contributes to their character as destinations for people to visit and linger.

However, an accumulating body of evidence shows that these efforts fail to adequately capture young people’s needs, particularly those from diverse cultures and contexts, and to incorporate their perspectives into practice. The present study aimed to address this gap by exploring young people’s views on how DV can be prevented and what they expect from prevention programs in an urban Turkish context, where DV remains an under-studied issue and preventive efforts are only slowly progressing. Toward this goal, a qualitative research design was employed. Thirty-nine college students, aged 18–25, were recruited through convenience sampling and individually interviewed in a semi-structured manner. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analyzed from a social constructionist perspective. The analysis revealed five main themes that indicated young people’s suggestions for and expectations from DV prevention: 1) setting new dating norms, 2) targeting socialization processes, 3) improving relational competence, 4) improving oneself, and 5) managing obstacles.

The use of this algorithm can effectively reduce the redundancy of modeling and centralized processing of multiple models, reduce the time consumption, improve the efficiency of modeling, and ensure the smooth operation of VR visualization system. It is important to note that the economic development of the region will affect the visualization effect, especially when studying the water shortage in high-level areas, so in the actual water resource problem-solving process, the cross basin water transfer method is often adopted. The inter basin water transfer project needs to span the distance of time and space in the process of implementation. It has the characteristics of multi-objective, multi task, dynamic change, and unknown. These characteristics determine that the inter basin water transfer project is a complex and arduous task. Water diversion project is born to solve the uneven distribution of regional water resources, which can effectively solve the problem of water supply and consumption. In addition, the water diversion project can also improve the ecological conditions of the region and can also improve the quality of drinking water in the receiving area, so as to improve the quality of life of the people in the region. With the continuous progress of society, urban construction began to pay more attention to public art. This paper studies the current situation of public art in modern cities in China and puts forward plans and suggestions in line with China’s national conditions according to the actual situation and prospects the future development of urban art in China. Urban public art originated in Western countries and developed rapidly after entering China. It is perfectly integrated with Chinese culture, forming a unique development path for China. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Cross basin; Urban public art; VR visual system; Water diversion project","algorithm; design method; economic development; modeling; project assessment; urban development; urban population; visual analysis; water resource; China",Retracted,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112372668

Therefore, facing the marginalization of the existing archaized streets in various cities, it is urgent to recognize their image and value and find out the strategies that can guide their sustainable development. First of all, we changed the traditional perspective of looking at archaized block cultural attractions through the comparison of a literature review and confirmed that the archaized block should connote a sense of community, fluidity, and publicity and highlight the foundation of local culture and field development. Secondly, we selected a case as the main object and compared the correspondence between the communicative and perceptive images of local residents to construct the connection map of the relationship between local residents and the case field. This part consists of two stages: (1) Through the official information and the intervention of Means–End Chain, we confirm the communicative image and perceptive image of this field, including 13 attributes, 12 consequences, and 11 values; and (2) The collected contents of attributes, consequences, and values were merged and converted into 36 variables to form the evaluation basis for the perceptive images of local residents. Finally, we conducted descriptive statistics, factor analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression through SPSS 20.0, constructed the A–C–V relation link diagram for the relationship between the field of the case with the local residents, and interpreted the content that should be focused on and the logic behind the constructed image of the field. In addition, the analysis has shown that the archaized block’s function is not only meant for tourism, but it also acts as a network information center combining local people, local knowledge, and local cultural resources, thus highlighting the diversity and value of the archaized block. This research not only provides suggestions for the marketing and design organizations of the archaized block to improve the image of the destination, but also to help the inheritance of urban culture. © 2021 by the authors.

While the subjectivity view is commonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of subsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion of beauty—structural beauty—among people and even different peoples, regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a physical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based on the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To verify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight pairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock’s Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies that goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an opinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision, architecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and psychology. © 2021 by the authors.

We therefore have to rethink how to adopt the seamless integration of sustainable transportation alternatives. Poor maintenance is one of the factors adduced to be responsible for the current deteriorated state of mobility corridors and the existing road infrastructure. Overpopulation and increasing socio-economic activities of Festac Town exerts undue pressure on the infrastructure, thereby accelerating deterioration. The study is underpinned by Eco-mobility principles. This study is aimed at assessing the eco-mobility approach for a sustainable neighbourhood road infrastructure within a mixed-use community. Developing a sustainable mobility strategies that brings the neighborhood streets back to the people is an objective which this study pursue. A multi-staged sampling technique was adopted for the study. On-site qualitative approach was majorly employed through the interviews conducted assessing the major mobility corridors and streets from 1st to 7th avenues. A sample frame of 15 major roads with outdoor open spaces along the selected roads all within the selected avenues and major street roads. The instruments for data collection were oral interviews and personal/physical observations. The activity profiles, locational data and geospatial coordinates of each avenue were imported into ArcGIS (Version 10.5, ESRI) for various land-use analysis. The sustainable eco-mobility strategies will reduce transportation impacts, create civilized streets that meets environmental design standards of commuter's safety and comfort that are compatible with the unique urban structure and culture of metropolitan Lagos.

In the culture war debates over sexual minority and gender identity rights that pervaded national politics in this period, protest served as a key venue to articulate not only queer visibility but queer political affect. The key to these protests is their site-specificity. The street is not just the site where protest takes place - rather it is an important ideological construct within Brazilian society and political imagination. Drawing on performance studies with an emphasis on the choreography and design of protest, this article examines how protest as a genre of street occupation frames queer lifeworlds as it presents them to the national public. LGBT people's struggle over and attachments to distinct locations in São Paulo, such as Paulista Avenue, become operationalized as part of the message of protest. Because of São Paulo's concentration of news media, the streets of São Paulo's downtown district play a distinct role in transmitting nationalized sentiment. © 2021 Association of Global South Studies, Inc.

Under the impact of COVID-19, the social carrying capacity and emotion dynamics in parks and recreation areas are expected to change due to the uncertainty of health risks associated with visitors’ behaviors. This study conducted an on-site visitor survey at Leiqiong Global Geological Park, a national park located in urban-proximate areas in Haikou, China. This study aims to examine factors impacting visitors’ perceived crowding and emotions under varying levels of visitor use in urban national parks in the context of COVID-19. Study results suggest that visitors have the highest level of motivation for scenery and culture viewing and are generally satisfied with the environmental quality and design and COVID-19 prevention strategies and implementation efforts within the park. Moreover, this study suggests that the level of crowding and COVID-19 prevention strategies and implementation can affect visitors’ emotions in urban natioanl parks significantly. These findings highlight the importance of enforcing the social carrying capacity limits and COVID-19 prevention strategies for urban parks and protected areas to mitigate physical and mental health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Management implication: This study is one of the pilot studies that examines the social carrying capacity and emotion dynamics in urban national parks under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study results identify the thresholds of social carrying capacity and visitors’ positive emotions based on the indicator of People Per View (PPV). Moreover, COVID-19 prevention strategies (e.g., mask-wearing and social distancing) can reduce visitors’ perceived crowding and enhance positive emotions. These findings suggest that urban national parks should monitor visitor use levels based on the social carrying capacity framework to reduce visitors’ perceived crowding and maintain positive emotions in the post-COVID-19 era. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Crowding; Emotion; Natural landscape; Prevention strategies; Social carrying capacity",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120348389

With a particular emphasis on citizens' participation, the project resettled close to 12,000 people from crumbling Victorian row houses into new public housing units distributed between a meandering perimeter wall and a series of smaller-scale clusters. Erskine's project proved to be distinctively flexible in adapting to significant social changes during a particularly turbulent period in UK's history. From the progressive deindustrialization of North England and Thatcher's erosion of working-class culture to British cities' growing racial diversity and its complex fallout. Such adaptability relates to the distinct position that Byker holds in-between two opposing architectural paradigms of the 20th Century. On the one hand, the modern tradition and its ambition to produce new urban and architectural forms stemming from social utopias; on the other, the 1970s countercultural ethos and its critique to top-down modernist design culture. In this paper, I argue that this paradoxical nature induced Byker's adaptability to social change. To get closer to the complex realities of everyday life without compromising modernity's utopianism, Erskine produces a realist project based on an illusion. A vernacular village of epic scale emerges as the impossible English incarnation of the negotiated built utopia of social democracy that he had experienced in Sweden. © Inheritable Resilience: Sharing Values of Global Modernities - 16th International Docomomo Conference Tokyo Japan 2020+1 Proceedings.",,"Architecture; History; Public policy; Citizen's participations; England; Housing development; Housing units; Perimeter walls; Public housing; Racial diversity; Small-scale clusters; Social changes; Swedishs; Housing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119096733

Elements such as architectural, heritage, and landscape centralities can lead to build a converging point between the two infrastructural systems of green and mobility. The development of the new urban railway lines in the city of Palermo (Italy) offers the chance to apply an integrated approach to the field. The local potentials of the biodiversity on one side and the fragmented landscape and environment systems on the other side build the framework for the development of a case study oriented to the enhancement of the people’s health and of the environment’s ecological functions. With the aim to produce a green–blue mobility infrastructure, the study takes as founding elements the many landscape-environmental characters of the territory like historic parks and gardens (Florence Chart), EC SPA, SCI and Natural urban reserves, and the existing water networks. In particular, the comparison between the green–blue linear networks of the territory before and after the modern urbanization has allowed to develop the structural map of “reconnections” as the base for the new infrastructure. Furthermore, taking into consideration the Italian regulation, the “monumental” trees have been adopted as urban pillars of the case study project for their environmental, cultural, and landscape value. The results of the study proved that the decision-making process for the “fast” mobility can positively interact with the “slow” mobility systems through the landscape system itself. In fact, the landscape, characterized by an intrinsic tendency to dynamics, can be interpreted as a “landscape in motion” connecting the existing urban tissue with cultivated, natural, and historic green areas. In conclusion, key aspects such as mobility, nature, culture, and social dimension have become milestones for the integrated spatial planning process. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Green infrastructures; Healthy city; Participatory planning; Smart city; Social green planning; Urban landscape",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116143461

Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed an action research approach to design and implement a mobile health hypertension education application to help India's most vulnerable populations. The authors used interpretive analysis, guided by the sustainable livelihoods framework, to uncover key findings. Findings: Successfully implementing information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) requires understanding that all stakeholders (i.e. donors, facilitators and the beneficiaries) have important assets to contribute. Facilitators play an important role in connecting donors to the beneficiaries and fostering cultural humility in donors so that the donors will understand the role beneficiaries play in success. Stakeholders may use the ICT4D in unintended ways that both improve the people's health and increase some beneficiaries' financial livelihood. Research limitations/implications: This research expands the definition of information systems success when implementing ICT4D in resource-constrained environments. Success is more than creating an mHealth app that was easy for beneficiaries to use and where they learned based on a pre- and post-test statistical analysis. Success involved development in all the stakeholders impacted by the social innovation collaboration. For the beneficiary community, success included getting screened for noncommunicable diseases as a first step toward treatment. For the facilitator, success involved more resources for their community health program. Amongst the donors, success was a change in perspective and learning cultural humility. Practical implications: Although universities encourage faculty to work in interdisciplinary research teams to address serious world problems, university researchers may have to exert considerable effort to secure contracts, approvals and payments. Unfortunately, universities may not reward this effort to build ICT4D and continue to evaluate faculty based on journal publications. When universities undertake social innovation collaborations, administrators should ensure responsive and flexible university processes as well as appropriate academic reward structures are in place. This need is heightened when collaborations involve international partners with limited resources and time needed to build relationships and understanding across cultures. Social implications: This study discovered the importance of fostering cultural humility as a way of avoiding potential conflicts that may arise from cultural and power differences. Cultural humility moves the focus of donor-beneficiary relationships away from getting comfortable with “them” to taking actions that develop relationships and address vulnerabilities (Fisher-Borne et al., 2015). This research shows how the facilitator helped the donor develop cultural humility by involving the donor in various initiatives with the beneficiary community including allowing the donor to live in a dormitory at the hospital, work in an urban slum and visit health screening campus. Originality/value: This study (1) extends the ICT4D literature by incorporating cultural humility into the sustainable livelihoods framework, (2) provides a contextual understanding of developing cultural humility in ICT4D projects with a complex group of stakeholders and (3) describes how facilitators become a catalyst for change and a bridge to the community. The culturally humble approach suggests revising the livelihood framework to eliminate words like “the poor” to describe beneficiaries. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action research; Cultural humility; Ethics; Grant; ICT4D; Livelihoods framework; Multidisciplinary; Social innovation collaboration; Transdisciplinary",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114149448

In this paper, we outline a framework for the study of material, cultural and social mechanisms interacting with human cognition, behavior and emotions. We attempt a conceptual model that integrates dynamic interactions between cognitive-cultural affordances and our conceptualization of the environment and provides a few illustrative case examples. The model proposes a set of dynamic relations between cognitive and cultural processes at shorter time scales modifying conceptualizations and environmental affordances on longer timescales, while these – in turn – come to guide and constrain processes at the shorter timescales.

Pakistan bears a high dual burden of both communicable and chronic diseases. However, a major contribut-ing factor of both is poor diet and nutrition. The causal pathway of stunting, underweight, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies has beginnings in less dietary diversity and food insecurity. Current literature on Pakistan and other South Asian countries regarding food insecurity and dietary diversity largely focus on women and children aged less than 5 years; however, ethnic and cultural dynamics of the populace concerning their food and dietary practices in Pakistan have not been well explored. It is essential to have a clear insight into the factors involving malnutrition in different clusters, especially different cultures and ethnicities to target specific areas of interven-tional strategies versus a uniform approach for all. This study aimed to explore the level of food insecurity and dietary diversity in all major ethnic groups of Karachi, the largest city of Pakistan. Methods: Using the multistage random sampling, 535 households from five major ethnic groups residing in Karachi were included in the study. To measure food insecurity and dietary diversity (primary and secondary outcome, respectively), we used a FAO standar-dized questionnaire (version 3, 2007) that was translated first into local languages, piloted, and employed to collect information. Results: Severe food insecurity levels had an inverse relationship with the household dietary diversity, which persisted even after adjusting for other variables (β=−0.31, 95% CI=−0.65, −0.07). There was no statistically significant association of age, marital status, or education level on food diversity. The most food secure cultural people were those whose ancestors had migrated from India and were Urdu speaking communities, while Sindhi speakers were the least food secure community. Conclusion: It is imperative to investigate more on the cultural causal factors leading to food insecurity to address the root causes of malnutrition and design new cultural-specific interventions that should be employed in large urban centers where different communities reside together. © 2021 Hashmi et al.","Dietary diversity; Ethnicity; Food insecurity; Urban population",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111579304

The latter marked the Algerian territory by leaving human settlements constituting a patrimonial richness that contemporary Algeria must safeguard. Constantine is one of the oldest cities of Algeria; it has gone through history by experiencing profound changes in its components, especially its public space. Indeed, each civilization has produced its own public space obeying its policy, its culture, its customs, its way of life, its manner of spatial occupation etc. The superposition or juxtaposition of urban fabrics of different historical periods has given birth to a variety of public spaces. From the old city, to the contemporary one passing through the colonial town, public space was produced according to a particular pattern breaking up with the one that precedes it. What are the characteristics of public space produced by each civilization that Algerian cities have known especially those that have a traditional fabric? As a result, this work aims to determine the morphological and pictorial characteristics of the public spaces of the different historical periods of the city of Constantine. This is why urban analysis is used to know the location, shape, quality of the public space and the role it has played and still plays in the city. The way in which Constantine lost the value of its public space is a question we must understand. This work tries to pinpoint the failings of the making of the current city in order to solve the crisis that these urban elements are going through. The ancient heritage constitutes the basis from which this analysis will find solutions to improve the state of recent public spaces and propose a better design for the future ones.

Background: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants continue to die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) at rates three to four times greater than other infants born in Australia despite Council of Australian Governments commitment to halve the gap in the Indigenous infant mortality rate by 2018. The Pepi-Pod® program is evidenced in New Zealand and Queensland to provide a culturally appropriate safe sleep alternative that contributes to the reduction of SIDS and SUDI. We have no evidence of acceptability or feasibility when offered through mainstream services in metropolitan South Australia. Methods: With a focus on decolonizing the research process through a two-way process for mutual learning between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal team members and community, a novel qualitative design was employed including photo elicited yarning sessions (n = 7), focus groups (n = 2), and field notes (n = 15). Results: Four themes emerged: 'you don't have to worry'; 'a way of sharing knowledge'; 'it looks like a bread box?' and 'need for consistent safe sleep messages'. The findings suggest that participants believe the Pepi-Pod® program may enrich Aboriginal families' lives evoking feelings of comfort and safety; however, the design could be improved to make them more culturally appropriate. There was confusion around safe sleep processes and education with a call for streamlining safe sleep messaging. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Community youth arts organizations have secured a certain prominence in this context over the past three decades and are now part of the urban infrastructures that shape connected learning networks in highly industrialized nations. In this capacity, youth arts organizations regularly engage a language and aesthetics of authenticity and trust as part of how they call out, represent and make a home for children and youth. This paper examines how authenticity in youth culture and youth cultural expression is negotiated by arts organizations and how organizations locate their own trustworthiness as allies of young people through the curation of online media archives. The analysis draws on the internet media archives of two youth arts organizations in Canada’s largest English-speaking cities. The Oasis Skateboard Factory (OSF) in Toronto, ON is an extension program of the Toronto District School Board that enables participants to create their own brands and learn to run a skateboard or professional design business. ReelYouth (Vancouver, BC) started in Vancouver in 2005 as a community media empowerment project, and now delivers programs across Canada and internationally. The claims to youth authenticity articulated in each media archive reveal how authenticity and trust are negotiated ideologically by each organization and how organizations mark their ontological status, as a home from which young people can think and respond to an unjust world. I examine how youth authenticity is produced by analyzing how discourses of youth identity, connection and trust are deployed across each archive. Whilst showcasing how authenticity is negotiated by each group, I show how the production of authenticity discourses by OSF and ReelYouth simultaneously convey a deeper reality: the way youth arts groups operate as care structures (Scannell, 2014) that offer ontological security (Giddens, 1991), and places of increasing “awareness of previously unnoticed interconnections” (Frosh, 2019, p. 16) for youth. In this way, they operate as sites of border work, places of routing from which the work of social justice can be borne. © 2021.

A few years later, Landry issues “The Creative City. A Toolkit for Urban Innovation”, a book in which he challenges and further develops his ideas by proposing them as a “toolbox for urban renaissance.” At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the American economist Richard Florida delivers what is considered a milestone on the subject of the creative city: “The Rise of the Creative Class”, in which he emphasizes the characteristics of people performing creative activities in cities, as well as the conditions that cities must offer in order for the “creative class” to be attracted and settle in them. The Smart Creative City is a more recent concept. It grew out of economic science, especially the so-called Experience Economy. Regarding specifically the economic development of cities, creativity, art, and culture represent strategic assets in the urban regeneration process, and the socioeconomic feature of smart creative cities can be considered the most evident and critical one. This study thus springs from the recognition of the relevance of smart creative cities, and of an integrated and visionary planning approach to urban regeneration—itself creative. This analysis has been conducted focusing on selected experiences developed by Lyon metropolis, aiming at understanding whether and how the municipality is levering on creativity, art and culture within its urban regeneration programmes. This objective is addressed through a mixed-qualitative methodology that investigates the political discourse and adopts a descriptive case study approach to analyse policy processes, drivers, and obstacles that are fostering or limiting that vision in the local context of Lyon. The research responds to the questions posed, showing both the transformative capacity and the trade-offs of explicitly integrating cultural and artistic projects and events, as urban “innovative” regeneration devices, within the “common” planning and design practice of the municipality of Lyon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Creative clusters; Experience economy; Lyon confluence; Lyon Gerland; Urban art","Economics; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Case study approach; Creative activity; Integrated urban planning; Planning and design; Political discourse; Qualitative methodologies; Regeneration devices; Urban regeneration; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106173669

These craft cluster communities make artisanal handmade products for unchanged rural, massy urban and niche luxury markets. Spradley (1979) defines, ethnography as the work of describing a culture from the native point of view. Ethnography in that sense, in this study, bridges the rural and urban divide to understand indigenous art, craft and the people in them [20].

It enlarges how design students co-create and innovate design solutions in the textile and craft sector. And within these inter-cultural exchanges and interactions, students learn the life lessons of being culturally sensitive.

In contemporary urbanism, there is a number of trends: temporal, of universal design, and social-cultural. The Russian urban development follows agglomeration trends that are increasingly evident in the processes of settlement, which means active development of suburban areas, changes in their landscape characteristics, cultural spaces, and mobility of citizens. The covid-19 pandemic had a complex impact on the social-urban features of cities in Russia and the world by transforming the structure and functionality of many urban locations, creating conditions for the emergence of a post-coronavirus city. The empirical data show that such a city is the most socially sensitive to negative and positive aspects of social life and to manifestations of inclusive practices that unite people. Under the low, fragmented accessibility of social, cultural and other infrastructure of cities that are designed for healthy people, there is a synchronization of urban infrastructure elements in the context of inclusion due to the social demand for a ‘coronavirus transformation’ of the architectural and urban environment in terms of social distancing. Based on the research data from different regions of Russia, the authors identify priority directions of the inclusive development of social urbanism: models of the inclusive culture of urban communities; monitoring of the city accessible environment for citizens of different age and mobility (in particular, with the ‘tracing’ and ‘walk along’ approaches); model of participatory urban planning and social expertise of the inclusiveness of the urban space; educational model of professional training in the field of social urbanism and universal design. © D.V.

The concept of critical spatial practice, introduced by architectural historian Jane Rendell, builds on Walter Benjamin and the late 20th century theories of Henri Lefebvre and Michel de Certeau to propose multi-disciplinary design practices that more effectively address contemporary spatial complexities. These theoretical frameworks operate through trans-scalar means to resituate the built environment as a nexus of flows, atmospheres, and narratives (Rendell, 2010). Assuming an analogous relationship to the contemporary city, critical spatial practices traverse space and time to engage issues of migration, informality, globalisation, heterotopia, and ecology. This essay documents an interdisciplinary academic design studio that employed critical spatial practices to study correspondences between Chinese and American cities. Here, the notions of urban and interior are relational. Urbanism and interior spaces are viewed as intertwined aspects in the historical development of Beijing hutongs and Cincinnati alleyways. These hybrid exterior-interior civic spaces create sheltered public worlds and socio-spatial conditions that nurture people and culture. © 2021, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.

The design of the public art and the impact of the city’s cultural and cultural identity in influencing the formation of such arts in contemporary landscapes by understanding their visual properties and identifying them in subsequent productions, thus gaining those spaces of cultural value. It gives a spirit, a sense of place and identity, and creates unforgettable places with its aesthetic artistic symbols, such as symbolic signs and references frequented by people. These arts sometimes challenge social customs as well as promote social interaction and belonging to the place. From the previous literature, we found the lack of knowledge in determining the design characteristics that affect the identification of the cultural place as the art belonging to the community, and the study of a series of design examples related to different cultures could identify many of the characteristics of public art that must be taken into account in the design of such arts. These arts can not only be decorative, but are integrated with the surrounding environment. Each country has its own art. It is important to note that there is no single artistic characteristic of all the arts of the whole world. But the community is what creates art in itself. The communities are constantly changing and with them the general taste changes. These arts have a great role in welcoming strangers in their peculiar designs, bright colours and architectural details, making them attractive to tourists from all over the world. It can be noted that the public arts cannot be characterized by eternity. They change according to the time changes of the society. This has been observed in the loss of many landscapes with the artistic content of their value, attracting the change of time, while many of them have lived throughout the years.

This is how cultural heritage sites enhance the quality and identity of urban as well as rural environments and provide for local resident`s economical wealth and tourism resource. Landscapes around the world are constructs of human beings—through ascriptions of it of mythological creation or through physical actions. In majority cases, archaeological sites and monuments are far away from being integrated into their present day setting. The landscaping or landscape design is one of the most controversial and unsolved aesthetic and functional aspect. The main aim of this paper is to analyse and evaluate archaeological sites from the perspective of landscape architecture and provision of new approach to the concept of heritage and nature preservation in terms of landscape planning and design principles. It will be achieved first by understanding cultural historic landscapes, archaeological sites, concept of architectural heritage and heritage bodies.

It creates efficient, fast, flexible and clear intelligent responses to the needs of different aspects and different levels, creating a person and society, people and people, people and things A harmonious environment. Adhering to the people-oriented concept, the English learning community places English learners at the center of English learning, and relies on the platform of lifelong education and lifelong English learning to improve the lifelong English learning ability of community members, thereby driving the continuous development of the entire community. Therefore, it is becoming more and more important to build English learning communities in smart cities. This article elaborates the basic strategies of constructing English learning communities in smart cities in China. The guiding ideology and overall goals and basic principles of the construction of smart city English learning communities are clarified, and the four aspects of constructing a modern education system, social service system, individual culture system, and characteristic resource system are used to build a smart city English learning community in China. The scientific design of the construction provides a feasible path for the research of this article from theory to practice. Finally, in the form of questionnaire surveys and interviews, the status quo of the construction of English-speaking communities in smart cities in China was investigated. Based on the information and data of the survey items, the problems in the construction of English-speaking communities in smart cities were raised. It also analyzes and summarizes key issues such as basic cognition, system architecture, and resource guarantee, providing a realistic basis for the further development of this thesis. The survey results show that about 19% of the community residents think that the construction of a learning community has little to do with themselves, and they should actively mobilize the enthusiasm and enthusiasm of community residents to participate in community activities. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Building problems; Building strategies; English-learning communities; Smart cities","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Internet of things; Machine learning; Privacy by design; Surveys; Community activities; Continuous development; Learning community; Life-long educations; Modern educations; Questionnaire surveys; System architectures; Urban construction; Smart city",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097099598

The human concepts changed through the years and evolved the housing patterns, methods, forms and uses. As the human needs, concepts and cultures changed - from the need of only a shelter above the head - to protect from weather, into home that provides not only protection but also physiological and psychological comfort and recreational facilities to practice various activities. The industrial revolution, and the development of mechanization with the technology development, in addition to economic and social changes, leading to lack of areas, which helped the change of housing features and its meanings. As it used to be consisted of two or three floors to hold one family only, it transformed into the existing towers and muti-story buildings to conclude large numbers of residents. The research relied mainly on surveys to measure the population's preference for housing. He also used field visits (for construction companies that play the role of owner and sometimes contractor and development) and documentary analysis to study the nature of the residential product mainly as well as to measure the level of preference for types and requirements of housing, as well as the use of interviews and panel discussions.

Houses for music – that is how we can briefly name buildings whose basic function is listening to music in the form of a concert - Philharmonic buildings. Also in the form of a show or performance fused with music. The third function of such buildings is to ensure the possibility for people to meet, adding certain nobility to the event in question, and therefore, added nobility to the venue itself. This last function is gaining significance. It is accompanied by the phenomenon of identifying the event as the function itself and simultaneously identifying the site. The growing value of such places stems from the oldest concept of urban planning, in search for that ‘modernity‘of the 20th century, an idea which has been forgotten and is now going through its revival. As Jan Gehl, an urban expert and humanist, reminds us, referring to the’city for people’. He reminds us that the number and the quality of the places are of utmost importance – places which create the occasion to participate in the urban membrane. The need for meeting builds the identity of a place, connecting cultural ideas with concepts which create culture and put architecture and music in the centre. The sound of the music itself becomes an element of the identity, the sound – however invisible, is very important for the place – on equal rights with the architecture of the designed buildings. The sound facilitated in the designs of these buildings creates the final quality of the architecture of the opera house or the Philharmonic. The dualism of the architectural and musical thought in the creation of the concept played a decisive role in creating the functionality of the venue, creating the true value of the place. It becomes a highly significant element of the quality of urban space. This short musing shows us that architecture and music are linked inter-disciplinarily as an important or perhaps even basic material for these buildings. The increasing significance of the relation between the buildings intended for music with the social strata of the city is very much visible in contemporary architectural concepts.The subject of this dissertation is the architectural concept and the context of buildings intended for music in urban space.

The object of the study is to understand the costume as an informational and sign structure. The topic of the study is the visualization of ethnicity through costumes from a historical perspective. The study aims to identify the specific characteristics of visualization of ethnicity in traditional and modern costumes. The study hypothesis is that, unlike traditional costumes that demonstrated regional and national affiliation, modern “Western” clothing has mostly lost these functions. Although in some regions costumes are still relevant as a “living” tradition, national clothing is disappearing from everyday life. Ethnic style using regional and national traditions as a source of stylization does not present an indicator of a person’s nationality. Nevertheless, some examples of modern clothing visualizing ethnicity can be found. The functional and semiotic approaches to the analysis of costumes serve as the basis of the study. Since the late Middle Ages, the development of urban dress in Western Europe has been determined by fashion rather than tradition. In Russia, the process of an urban costume losing the function of visualization of ethnicity began with the reforms of Peter the Great and for peasants’ costumes, this process did not start until the middle of the 20th century. At the beginning of the 21st century, traditional costumes were mostly worn by ethnic minorities as a symbol of national identity and self-affirmation. Referring to others’ traditions as a source of fashion innovations led to the emergence of ethnic style. Ethnic style is characterized by a superficial attitude towards the source. Ethnodesign, on the other hand, follows the principle of deep and thoughtful care about the tradition which gains relevance due to the rise of glocalization manifesting in the intensification of regional differences. Although the proponents of ethnodesign insist on the ability of design to integrate traditional ethnic symbols into modern culture, the question is about the ability of modern people to understand the meanings contained in traditional forms remains. The present article identifies the cases of a costume serving the function of visualization of ethnicity in modern society. © AesthetixMS 2020.","Ethnicity; Ethnodesign; Functions of a costume; Modern costume; Traditional costume; Visualization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101254329

The workshop has been jointly developed since 2016 by academic faculty in Architecture, Interior Design, Visual Communication, Design Management and Social Community Work from India and Israel. The workshop takes place each summer in India and Israel simultaneously. Students from the above fields and countries participate in multidisciplinary and multicultural teams. Each team is assigned a case study in a community where people live in dense environments and often have limited economic resources. Students are challenged with a design task and develop together with people in the community concepts that can improve living conditions in the specific site and might hopefully be scaled up to be implemented elsewhere in the world. According to 'Habitat III New Urban Agenda' the main tool for urban sustainability and resilience is the ability to design solutions that cover different scales, time frames and disciplines, all through a cultural and human-based perspective. Such solutions can be derived from communities in different cultures, living within limitations of small spaces, who develop intrinsic design responses that are remarkably resilient and suitable to the context. This forms a significant area of study largely ignored by designers. The research method is based on the triangulation of qualitative (before and after interviews with all participants) and quantitative methods, as well as design analysis of the case studies. The research suggests that a combination of multidisciplinary, multicultural and participatory practice is a viable pedagogical tool for sustainable transformative education. Findings indicate that this multi-layered design education facilitates the development of skills critical to the understanding of complex systemic socio-technological problems, and to foster the development of creative solutions viable for implementation in the community. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architectural design; Students; Visual communication; Creative solutions; Economic resources; Multi-cultural teams; Pedagogical tools; Quantitative method; Social communities; Tools and methods; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097134150

Across Islamic cultures and civilizations, as well as their historical precedents, the marketplace has occupied a broad and complex social meaning, especially in Iran. In this research, the marketplace is considered from a socio-commercial point of view. In order to improve the efficiency of public spaces, it is necessary to identify their effective parameters of socialization, and utilize them towards the future design or improvement of built environments. While the socio-cultural influence of a bazaar determines the development of human relationships around it, its environmental components are also effective in responding to ‘physical needs’ of a populace, that is, the provision of necessities such as food and clothing as well as repair services. The relationship between environmental, social and cultural elements is found to be the most influential factor in increasing the sociality of the public space. In order to analyze bazaar socialization, the research methodology employed in this article comprises a descriptive survey that uses Delphi and Q methodology. According to the results, six key factors were identified: activity-behavioural-movement (ABM) components, physical-functional qualities, enviornmental impacts, physical components (PCs), cultural values (CVs), social cohesion and integration, diversity and spatial attraction. Crucially, the study also finds that the socialization of space is formed through the interaction between human experiences in place and the prevailing cultural forms within it, that is, the regional customs, traditions and overall ‘way of life’ of the native populace. Therefore, the cultural features of urban spaces are another important factor in their development. Studying these factors opens the possibility for facilitating greater levels of interaction and participation in public spaces in a manner that also accommodates different groups of people and their varying subcultures. © 2020 National Institute of Urban Affairs.","cultural and social Factors; environmental; Iranian traditional bazaars; public space; Q methodology; Socialization; Tabriz Grand Bazaar","cultural relations; economic development; future prospect; public space; social behavior; urban area; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091767702

Commercial centers in large cities are considered as the metropolitan critical areas. Commercial centers in metropolises are prone to crisis and the accidents in these centers can lead to human, social, and economic disasters. The presence of old textures, monuments, cultural features, large numbers of visitors per day, incompatibility of traffic routes with some of these centers, weak infrastructure and facilities, etc. increase the importance of crisis management in metropolitan commercial centers. In recent years, existence of some major weaknesses in crisis management in metropolises has revealed the need for complementary approaches such as resilience engineering. Resilience engineering is a new approach to measuring and maintaining safety in complex systems, with the goal of maintaining the capacity of the organization at an acceptable level to face crisis and maintaining the ability of the organization to return to its pre-crisis state. The purpose of this study was to design a questionnaire for crisis management assessment in commercial centers, based on resilient engineering approach. Several commercial centers of Tehran were selected for this study. Methods: Management commitment, reporting culture, learning culture, transparency, preparedness, awareness, and flexibility were considered as the main criteria of resilience r engineering (RE). After identifying the main criteria, the questionnaire questions were extracted based on literature review, field studies, experts’ opinions, and the use of contextual content analysis, . Then a questionnaire with 97 questions was designed according to experts’ opinions. This questionnaire was evaluated by 17 experts of safety and crisis management, using Delphi technique. For initial screening of identified sub-criteria, a score between 1 to 5 was assigned for each of them and any sub-criteria with score of less than 3 was omitted. The Delphi technique was applied in two rounds and a questionnaire with 68 questions was approved in the second round. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to calculate the consistency of experts' opinions. The ANP model was then used for weighting and prioritizing the sub-criteria. The sub-criteria were compared in pairs based Saaty’s 1-9 scale. Reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by calculating the inconsistency rate. If the inconsistency rate of the pairwise comparisons is greater than 0.1, it is better to revise the comparisons. DEMATE L technique was used to identify criteria interrelationships. The matrix derived from the DEMTEL technique (Interrelationships matrix) is able to show the causal relationship between the effectiveness of the variables and their capacity to be influenced by the other factors. The ANP analysis consists of four steps. Step 1: Identifying the main criteria; Step 2: Identify interrelationships; Step 3: Determining the overall priorities; and Step 4: testing the consistency. Based on the calculations and the limit super-matrix, the final priorities of sub-criteria were derived by the SuperDecision software. In this study, TO PSIS technique was used to select s the best shopping center among other shopping complexes in Tehran. The 5-point Likert scale was used to score the shopping centers based on each sub-criterion. Finally, the research data were analyzed through multiple case studies in 7 commercial complexes using a researcher-made questionnaire to determine the level of resilience. The data were analyzed using Excel and SPSS 18 software. Results: Based on the Kendall's coefficient of concordance, the consistency rate of experts' opinions in the first and second rounds were 0.317 and 0.637, respectively. The results showed that management commitment, preparedness, awareness, culture of reporting, flexibility, culture c of learning, and transparency (which had normalized weights of 0.182, 0.80, 0.178, 0.155, 0. 128, 0.100, and 0.077, respectively) had the priorities of 1 to 7 respectively. The results of the management commitment sub-criteria analysis showed that setting and communicating the policies and objectives of crisis management in the commercial complex by the manager was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.168). Issues such as the building structure and selecting the right people, the manager's attention to the importance of building safety, preparing the plans, and providing the resources and equipment needed for the complex were the next priorities. For the culture of reporting sub-criterion, tendency of individuals to report errors and unsafe situations in the commercial centers was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.132). Therefore, organizations should always pay attention to reports provided by employees and customers. For the culture of learning sub-criterion, the commercial centers’ use of previous accidents and crises to better respond to future events was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.238). Learning from crisis simulation and practical exercises to build up teamwork experience for speeding up reactions to similar events were the next priorities. The results of this prioritization of learning culture sub-criteria indicate the importance of learning from past events to prevent similar events. For the transparency sub-criterion, Identification of non-conformities and deviation of commercial complexes from normal safety limits was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.084). The inconsistency rate of the comparisons was 0.084, which is less than 0.1. For the preparedness sub-criterion, existence of a crisis management team in the commercial center was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.161) and creating and communicating the emergency response document, deploying the safety management system, identifying related risks in commercial complexes, developing and implementing the preventive programs and plans, implementing the safety rules and regulations to inspect and retrofit structural and non-structural components of commercial complexes, increasing their resistance against crisis, anticipating cooperation with foreign relief organizations, alert systems readiness, smart fire alarm systems, performing maneuvering operations, and training of employees and tradepeople were the next priorities, respectively. For the awareness criterion, reporting of the complex safety problems was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.142). Defining a transparent communication mechanism to report safety concerns, increasing intergroup coordination and collaboration at a time of crisis, and how they perform their tasks against task descriptions were the next priorities, respectively. For the flexibility criterion, sub-criterion of ability to control unforeseen environmental conditions by management was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.25). Employee decision-making without unnecessary waiting for management orders was the next priority. DEMATEL technique showed that the management commitment was the most effective criterion and had the least capacity to be influenced by the other factors. The criterion of preparedness had the highest capacity to be influenced by the other factors. The criterion of transparency had the highest interaction with other criteria. Calculation of the final priorities of the sub-criteria performed by the ANP technique showed that the sub-criterion of identifying non-conformities and deviation from safety boundaries was the first priority (with the normalized weight of 0.0448), the commercial centers’ use of previous accidents and crises to better respond to future events was the second priority (with the normalized weight of 0.34), sub-criterion manager ability to control unforeseen environmental conditions was the third priority (with the normalized weight of 0.0293), and simulating crisis and performing practical exercises to create teamwork experience and increase reaction speed was the fourth priority (with the normalized weight of 0.0278). Conclusion: Based on the results of the research, in the crisis management of commercial complexes based on the resilience engineering approach, management commitment and preparedness are the most significant criteria and transparency is the least significant criterion in creating resilience against crises. overall, the results showed that the designed crisis assessment questionnaire based on the seven principles of resilience engineering, is efficient and appropriate for assessing crisis management in commercial complexes and this questionnaire can be used to know the current situation of crisis management in commercial complexes. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

It argues that centering classroom pedagogy and curriculum on youth self-actualization best supports the critical literacy development of students grappling with social and structural inequities within an ever-evolving youth and media culture. Design/methodology/approach: Building upon previous literature on critical literacy, Hip Hop pedagogy and adolescent identity formation, this paper shares data from a semester-long teacher–researcher case study of a high school Hip Hop literature and culture class to explore how young people develop critical literacies and self-actualizing practices through a critical study of youth culture. Findings: For youth engaged in Hip Hop culture, co-constructing spaces to discuss their consumption of popular media and culture in class allows them to openly grapple with questions of identity, provide support for each other in dealing with these questions and reflect more critically upon their self-constructed, performed and perceived identities. Originality/value: This form of English education challenges traditional notions of teaching and learning as it positions students as co-creators of curriculum and as part of the curriculum itself. Building on research that frames Hip Hop pedagogy as a culturally relevant tool for engaging urban youth, this paper argues that educators should approach critical Hip Hop literacy development as a means by which young people across diverse educational and social backgrounds come to know themselves and others as part of the process of self-actualization and critical resistance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adolescent identity; Critical literacy; Hip Hop pedagogy; Youth epistemologies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085077493

I consider a series of moments from the Vichy government’s destruction of the Vieux Port in an effort to stamp out resistance during WWII, to the transformation of La Criée aux Poissons from a fish market to a theater in the 1970s, to the recent pedestrianization of the shoreline and the construction of the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations. The Vieux Port’s aesthetic transformations have reflected prevailing sentiments about the meaning of Marseille’s past and its hope for the future. While the recent prevalence of cosmopolitanism in Marseille’s year as European Capital of Culture and its urban revitalization efforts is striking, the concept has been used as a narrative for the city’s revitalization since at least the 1970s. Whereas some have argued that the spaces of cosmopolitanism are hyper-mobile, abstract non-spaces, I argue that Marseille’s cosmopolitanism is historical and linked as much to spaces of immobility as spaces of mobility. Far from distancing itself from history and tradition, Marseille has incorporated its ancient past into a cosmopolitan culture-led urban renewal project. Ethnographically examining pedestrian traffic around the port reveals that the spaces where people come to rest are as essential as the spaces of constant movement and flow in charting cosmopolitanism in the city. © 2020 by the American Anthropological Association","Aesthetics; Cosmopolitanism; European Capital of Culture; Marseille; Mobility","esthetics; historical perspective; mobility; planning history; post-war; urban design; urban history; urban renewal; urbanization; Bouches du Rhone; France; Marseilles; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088930082

From their creative capacities, young people can design territorial models in order to promote responsible mobility. Young people with university education are more sensitive to the value of designing more friendly cities. Therefore, all social transformation based on citizen co-responsibility has its origin in feelings of sympathy, in other words, in the search for urban happiness in order to achieve a dignified human life. In this context, the research question is: How to motivate youth social entrepreneurship in city neighborhoods for mobility and strengthening of citizen culture? The research methodology was based on 710 student surveys on Quality of Life and Urban Mobility in the Aburra Valley (Colombia). The young university students belong to the last semester. At the same time, 8 interviews were conducted: Youth Tables, Municipal Secretaries of Citizenship and Mobility.

In Kuala Lumpur, high demand of affordable quality housing for urban poor has yet to be fulfilled. In order to meet demand for adequate affordable housing for low-income households, the government has introduced numerous housing programs. However, anecdotal evidences suggest that most of this typical type of affordable housing may have design deficiency that could affect occupants' housing satisfaction. This paper critically reviews on housing policy, typology and design issues for low-income housing in the context of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This paper argues that there is a direct relationship between housing design and occupants' satisfaction. Based on the review, it can be recommended that housing design for low-income people should consider factors such as safety, local climate, privacy, sufficient space, layout planning, culture and social integration. Implications for the design of future housing for low income people are raised and the need for the improvement of the ongoing research is identified. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In coastal cities, the architectural features along the coast are the epitome of the history and culture of coastal cities. With the rapid development of China's construction industry, people have put forward higher requirements for the design of building structures while ensuring the engineering quality. The architectural features along the coast with regional characteristics can not only continue the urban context, but also improve the image of the city and deeply impress people on the overall impression of the city. In architectural engineering design, the selection of structural design and structural measures is very important for the whole project construction. To a certain extent, it reflects the work results and design level of design engineers, but also brings a certain foundation for the improvement of construction efficiency. In the current architectural design, structural design is no longer limited to the traditional design mode, but a comprehensive design mode guided by various new technologies, new ideas and new ideas. Based on this, this paper mainly expounds the concept design and structural measures in architectural design. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.","architectural design; Coastal cities; conceptual design; structural measures","Chen chen; Florida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095121708

And while the city is considered one of the most important means of accomplishing economic and social development goals, this paper argues that urban planning affects the relationship between the city and the city's people as well as the development of its commercial growth. This study aims to research and compare the advantages and the disadvantages between the shops opened directly to a street and the shops opened to a plaza (the pedestrian mall) in Irbid city downtown. The study has focused on the identification of architectural and urban patterns and the artistic aspects of urban design. Conversely, this research aims to identity the needs of the users by introducing the hypothesis that the behavioral patterns in any designed space relies on the designers personal perceptions and understanding of the behavioral and usage patterns of the individuals within it, the understanding of which positively reflects on both the spatial qualities and the individual's perception of it. The questions of this research are as follows: (1) What is the role of the design of the commercial shops in creating a sense of pleasure and safety in the downtown of Irbid city? (2) How do shops play out their role in the growth and expansion of commercial development? Through visual survey and the analytical studies of the GIS data, the research determines an overall preference of one of the market-space designs. The results show that shops which are opened to a plaza are vital in giving a sense of security and integrity to the concept of the downtown commercial area, it also provides organization among the different parts of the commercial area and plays two important roles: (1) they interconnect the different parts of the city's physical structure; and (2) the vital role of the city's economic and social life. In conclusion, this paper offers recommendations for the redesign and development of the building's regulations in the downtown to achieve the proper relationship between urban planning and urban development, deal with the modern city development and reflect the relationship with its own culture. © 2020 WITPress.

To measure health literacy based on the public health approach, Pleasant and Kuruvilla developed the Public Health Literacy Knowledge Scale (PHLKS). The availability of PHLKS in different societies will contribute to situational investigation and community awareness by public health professionals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the PHLKS in Turkish society. Design: Cross-sectional study. PHLKS was translated into Turkish. Setting: This study was conducted on a random sample of people from rural and urban family health center in Kütahya Province, located in the West Anatolia Region. Subject: Data were collected by researchers via face-to-face interviews with participants. Intervention: PHLKS was used as an intervention tool. Main outcome measure: Not applicable Results: According to factor analysis, variance in the one-dimensional structure was 52.8%, and the factor loads of 17 items in the scale ranged between 0.39 and 0.72. For internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha was found to be 0.673. The average scores of the public health literacy information level in the rural region were significantly lower than those in the urban region (Z:-3.167, p: 0.002).

It is internationally recognized by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which set as the first target of SDG 11 to ensure, by 2030, access to all to adequate, safe and affordable housing, to ensure access to basic services and to improve slums. Cities need large spaces and are the main source of wealth and the center of innovation, culture and politics. Obviously, they have become the most important arena of humanity. Today, in most cities in the world, forms of urbanism develop side by side in the same urban space. This situaton happens also in other cities in developing countries including Indonesia. This paper will discuss about the patterns of informal urban space utilization carried out by low-income communities. The method used is conducting field surveys and observing objects that have been determined directly in some cities. By discovering the pattern of informal use of urban space, it can be formulated as how low-income communities use the urban space to settle and business informally. Based on the formulation that has been made, a planning and design method is developed which can later be proposed as a sustainable development strategy for improving urban areas occupied by low income people. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Informal settlement; Low-income; Space utilization; Sustainable Development","Architectural design; Developing countries; Housing; Planning; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Affordable housing; Field surveys; Informal settlements; Low incomes; Low-income communities; Planning and design; Space utilization; Sustainable urban development; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081051521

The theoretical research results of neuroscience are affecting daily life, environment, space, context, and place profoundly. It provides a new way of thinking and method to explain human's mind and behavior. In the context of post- modernism, the understanding of selfconsciousness in human geography has become fragmented. Non- presentation theory and embodied cognitive geography claim that in most of the time, people are ""unconscious"". Subject self- consciousness is irrational, which takes place in the ""outflows"" daily life world. It emphasizes the showing, performance, and practice of the body. The meaning of the real world should be obtained through embodied cognition and behavior. They found evidence from neuroscience that led to a ""neural turn"" in geography. The ""neural turn"" devotes to linking human's mind and behavioral traits to biological evidence. It is different from inter-disciplinary debates that are breaking down the disciplinary boundaries between social culture and natural sciences. The laboratory methods cannot reflect the real world, and the social science methods are difficult to get rid of subjective factors. The ""neural turn"" can provide a research perspective of combining the-first-person and the-third-person for human geography. This article reviewed the recent studies on the ""neural turn"" in Western human geography. ""Neural turn"" research mainly concentrated in three aspects: Space perception, embodied affect, and behavior practice. It has involved economic, political, social, cultural, public policy, tourism, and education topics. The application of neuroscience in human geography can also be applied to multiple scales of space such as country, city, community, and body. Neuroscience perspective as a new path is used in urban planning, environmental design, tourism development, and public policy, among others. At the same time, the technical tools of neuroscience have become new data collection methods in human geography. Neural technology can capture imperceptible physiological changes in the human body in order to detect neural activity caused by mind and behavior in a particular environment and context. The collection of physiological data can surmount the representation of text and symbols to discover non- representational results. Brain images and eye tracking technologies have been applied in geography, presenting predictable visions for the future. At present, Chinese human geography pays little attention to neuroscience. This article is hoped to provide some reference and enlightenment for the study of Chinese human geography. The dialogue between neuroscience and human geography is still in its infancy and needs more empirical research. In this process, human geography can carry out more cooperative research to produce more knowledge spillover. At the same time, these studies need to explore the topic of Chinese localization in order to better realize the people- oriented approach in the research and application of Chinese human geography. © 2020, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

Whereas the former ought to broaden its notion of “lives worth living,” the latter would benefit from a more specific theory of design-the making and remaking of more livable worlds. In response, this article offers the concept of “alterlivability,” a design philosophy grounded in permaculture ethics. Drawing on two novels by ecofeminist writer Starhawk-The Fifth Sacred Thing (1994) and City of Refuge (2016)-the article explores the genre of speculative design fiction for its insights into prototyping more livable futures in the Anthropocene.

The impact of space experience during gameplay is underpinned by the interrelations between systems and rules in gaming and urban theories. Augmented reality games such as Pokemon Go (PG) have activated the social pattern, pedestrian movement and public engagement in urban space by overlaying the data of augmented space on urban space. Current studies suggested that spatial engagement through the augmented reality can inform alternative design approaches within the public realm. This present study particularly builds on the premise that augmented reality influences the use of dormant space and creates accidental gathering spaces during PG gameplay. Taking Desa Park City, an urban residential area that is activated by PG as a case study, this paper examined the interface of physical space, augmented reality and the users engagement of space. Observations of 33 activated urban spaces are mapped to compare the spatial qualities activated by the augmented space. The findings suggested that the algorithm of PG frames the engagement of users within the urban space, which are linked to the settings of the physical space such as large scale structures, seating, accessibility and level of privacy. The paper argued that the relationship between real, augmented and perceptual space offers alternative user experiences and social patterns in engaging with urban space, contributing potential design strategies to activate otherwise dormant urban spaces and its potential to unify people from different culture group through the global universal perception of space. It provided an alternative method to study the social pattern of urban space based on the algorithm of game, which can be used to observe different types of space and culture interlaced with virtual space. © SEARCH Journal 2020.","Augmented reality; Pokemon Go; Public space",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100156820

Design/methodology/approach: This research used two research methods to collect data as follows: literature review, content analysis and face-face questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the most effective factors that shape the Amman’s identity from different perspectives. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (Pearson r) was computed to assess the relationships between all factors that shape the identity of any city from the perspective of Jordanian designers and experts. Findings: This research concluded that the factors that shape the city identity are cultural factors (socio-cultural, historical, economical and globalization factors), environmental factors (geographic, climate and building materials factors) and urban and architectural factors (spatial design organization, architectural style, open spaces and parks, urban structure factors). Additionally, the six urban development factors that responsible for the hybridization process in a city are new architectural typology and new special configuration, urban edges and hybrid textures, public hybridization open spaces, roads highway-scapes, urban redevelopment through super sites by star architects and downtown urban developments. This research found that there are different perspectives about the definition and factors that shape the identity of Amman’s city because of differences in cultures, experiences, knowledge, education level and personal preferences. The city identity is not a constant concept. It is changed according to time, place, people, culture, global trends, economic status and experience. Moreover, the correlation results revealed that the relationships/interrelationships between all the factors that shape the identity of any city have strong/very strong positive linear associations and significant relationships (r > 0.89). Practical implications: Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) should provide a vision to redefine the identity of Amman city and control over the development pressure, built form and image of the city. This vision should be based on research, analysis and adoption of the most effective road map. GAM and all stakeholders should establish and enforce using specific architectural styles, urban design guidelines, building codes, policy tools and land use regulations to re-define the city identity. GAM should review, assess, approve and supervise all development projects through all design and construction phases especially in sensitive areas. GAM should focus on building capacity, empower its architects and planners, and re-organize (re-structure) their units and administrations especially planning and licensing departments to improve the city image and guide development. This research recommended that architects should design new, diverse and innovative architectural concepts, typologies and spatial configurations. Rapid development and new edges should be planned, designed and managed from the parts to the whole. The heterogeneous landscape and everyday activities will improve the vitality of urban and open public spaces and form of public culture. Architects and star architects ought not to make a clear and sharp separation between old and new development, architectural styles and typologies. Architects and urban designers ought to design hybrid physical urban environments, urban morphology, urban multi-functional activities, mix-use buildings, open spaces for social life, street patterns and furniture, squares, architectural style and typologies, spatial connectivity, green spaces and landscape entities. The designers and planners should consider how to create a city for living, working and recreation. Originality/value: This research defined the identity, city identity, architectural identity and the factors that may shape the city identities. This research proposed and used the hybridization process as a tool to re-locate (re-define) the identity of Amman city and any city to be more obvious. Additionally, this research examined the relationships/interrelationships between the factors that shape the city identity. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Architectural identity; City identity; Hybrid design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087739904

And “perception” toward tradition has created the bonding between human values, tradition, and technological progression. “Perception” is the identification, organization, and interpretation of sensory information into coherent unified meaning to self and to the world. Since perception is based on human interpretation and meaning; it varies with factors like culture, civilization, and age of development. Hence, perception forms the “imageability” of the space and altered with time and space. The chapter would concentrate on the rapid urbanization that has led to the disparity of identity, imbalances of the indigenous knowledge system, deterioration of cultural and regional assets, and hence, a decline in individual empowerment. The chapter focused on the indigenous architectural forms and knowledge system as a part of everyday aesthetics. It attempts to grasp the physical, tangible architectural forms and patterns of space. Therefore, define and evaluate the form, style, and pattern of the architecture itself and space around by analyzing people’s perception toward it. The study would culminate through assessment of architectural patterns and built environment in two different case studies, namely, vernacular architectures at Santiniketan in Birbhum and Jorasanko Thakur Bari and their alternative responses to different versions and priority of nature and ecology. This chapter brings to light how a pre-transitional context of Jorasanko Thakur Bari grafted from a hardcore urban footprint in British Industrial Calcutta had contrasted with a posttransitional eco-friendly setup of Birbhum in Rural Bengal from which Santiniketan and its eco-exploratory setup was carved out. Thus there is a need of a search for qualities of regional vernacular architectural aesthetics, use of space, and people’s perception toward it as against the more formal Bauhaus kind of design elements of formal urban spaces and its built environment. But the chapter does not end in contrasting and likening the two. Rather it takes another step to bring together the best of the two worlds. Therefore, integrating indigenous knowledge with modern technicalities may help to promote, sustain, and alter people’s perception toward both vernacular and modern forms and patterns, and arrive at a design vocabulary of the third kind. Hence the chapter has been segmented into three sequences of discussion, i.e., firstly, indigenous architecture as explored through the analyses and discussions of vernacularism and regionalism, on the one hand, and contemporary formal architectural aesthetics, on the other hand; secondly, a composite focus on the range and gaps of the experiences in cultural and social contexts based on the twin cases and its allied people’s perception; and thirdly, at a need to delineate an attempt to chart out recommendations on the basis of an innovative and creative approach to integrate vernacular into modern architecture and vice versa. With these three successions of discussions, the deliberation hopes to alter general perception toward the extremities, like “Indigenous” and “Modern,” and portray a new design vocabulary of the third order. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Forms and patterns of perception; Integration and a third order; Modern architecture; Pattern of space; Perception; Vernacular architecture",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078534452

This settlement, Castro of Senhora do Bom Sucesso is a place where the surrounding landscape stands out with several mountains around it, in an environment where the flora and fauna, characteristics of this region, stand out. The whole history of the place, refers to a certain period of the past, valuing it and able to make the experience that the Nature Tourism can provide even better. Being one of the highest places in the central region of Portugal, it is for many people, a special place of enjoyment and relaxation. In this place, hundreds of years ago, there were between 80 and 100 houses of ancient people from the Celtic culture. Later, due to the abandonment by Men, these houses became disused, falling into a rapid decay process with the collapse of walls and roofs, making the roads impassable and the place covered with vegetation. Thus, in this work, in methodological terms, based on literature review, the collection of cartographic elements of the place, and in the field and cabinet studies, it was possible to develop an investigation on the Military Heritage of the region, in order to analyze in detail, the relation of the nature of the place with the architecture. This work resulted in a proposal for the site of the former Castro do Bom Sucesso, with the main objective of creating an Ecotourism Park, around the Celtic culture and autochthonous nature, organized in the following main equipment: I) Reception of the Ecotourism Park; (ii) ""Celtic Bungalows"" iii) Celtic Interpretation Center; iv) biological pool and v) Camping.

It is and always was also hard to design and build in Chile due to the isolation of this country from the rest of the South American continent thanks to the difficulty to overcome the barrier formed by the Andes. Can these unique conditions be used to create a unique architecture that brings new qualities to global heritage? Perhaps all these ""threats"" are also a significant potential for creation, using beautiful landscapes and pure nature. In the beginning, there was the Word. Architectural culture requires faith and extreme sacrifice. For this reason, the presentation begins with a project to which its architects devoted their lives and decided to become men of the cloth. Buildings devoted to religious worship often exceed the utilitarian dimension of architecture, becoming the determinants of directions that architecture will follow. An example of this heroic expression of architecture is the construction of the Benedictine Church in Les Condes, a suburb of Santiago, in 1962-1964. Can Theatre be a cure allowing people to overcome trauma? The programme of reconstruction of the city of Concepción in Chile after the destruction wrought in 2010 by the tsunami, included not only the restoration of previously existing housing and infrastructural functions, but also the introduction of new cultural function. In 2011, an architectural competition for the design of the Regional Theatre was announced, which was won by three Chilean architects Smiljan Radić, Eduardo Castillo and Gabriela Medrano. The building was put into use in 2018 and is not only a monument of the past, but also a sign of a new beginning (Figure 1). One of Chile's greatest natural resources is its diverse landscape. Difficult accessibility of many areas, low population density and unfavourable climate are the main factors that have caused large areas of land to remain in their natural state. Along with the development of society and the popularisation of tourism, a need arose to build the right background for exploring these natural values. The history tourism in extreme conditions is not long. In Poland, for example, it dates to 1850, when the first winter expedition to the Valley of Five Ponds in the Tatra Mountains took place. In Chile, the first tourist expedition to Patagonia took place in 1879 and was described in the book by its organiser and participant, Lady Lorance Dixie (Dixie, 1880). These extremely hard natural conditions have created a unique opportunity to create modern architecture in interaction with the natural landscape. We will examine this problem on the example of 5 hotels and 5 ways of interacting with the landscape and study these architectural ideas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Population statistics; Urban planning; Volcanoes; Architectural competition; Architectural cultures; Extreme conditions; Modern architectures; Natural conditions; Natural landscapes; Population densities; Volcanic eruptions; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072953104

Several studies revealed several unbeneficial of chewing betel nut, such as acute betel nut toxicity, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorder, and congenital defect. Besides, betel nut may also alter oral health. This study is aiming to analyse the correlation of habitual chewing betel nut toward salivary pH and flow rate. This was an observational analytic study, by means of cross sectional design involving both on male and female aging 17-50 years old in 4 subdistrict, consisting of 2 remote areas and 2 urban areas. The correlation between variables was analysed using path analysis by means of Smart PLS 3.2.7. The analysis revealed a positive correlation between Oko Mama culture toward behaviour (p=0.316) and intention (p= 0.454), also a negative correlation between the culture toward oral hygiene knowledge (p=-0.185) and the effect of chewing betel nut knowledge (p=-0.111). A positive correlation also recorded toward perceived norm (p=0.931). While intention had a positive correlation toward behaviour (p=0.429). Regarding oral health, chewing betel nut had negative effect toward salivary pH (p=-0.167) and salivary flow rate (p=-0.210). © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The validity of Florida’s concept is not here reviewed; rather, the paper is a case study on how his theory – that talent, technology and tolerance compose the high-value triptych driving a city’s growth and attractiveness – can be appropriated by HR to trigger profound changes in corporate governance and culture. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a return on experience of a project that was implemented at Mazars, an international mid-cap of 20,000 people in 86 countries, over the course of one year. Approximately, 50 individuals participated in the initiative, lead by the firm’s HR leadership team, which used an under the radar approach based on a revamped version of Owen’s Open Space Technology. From an academic perspective, the approach is inspired by Argyris’ action science, and more specifically a derivation of the “double loop learning” where the initial intent of the research might be modified by intermediary findings. Findings: The paper offers a model for identifying the members of the “creative class” in a corporate environment and a tested approach for integrating the “creative class” into the exclusive and institutional exercise of setting strategy. The cumulative effect of this “unofficial” operation is the creation of unique thought leadership and projects, some of which have now been officially adopted in the four-year strategic plan and institutionalized in the new governance system, results difficult to achieve through conventional approaches. Research limitations/implications: The case study, which is still in progress, has been implemented in a non-conventional organisation in a very specific industry. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first application of Richard Florida’s urban renewal theory in the corporate environment. This is an example of innovative HR management responding quickly and effectively to the digital, disrupted business landscape. It is designed in the modern managerial spirit of test-and-learn, structured as an agile initiative in an open-source world. It provides a prototype to be replicated and tested in other environments. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Creative class; HR innovation; Organizational design; Organizational transformation; Talent management; Unconference",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070903958

Networks, technologies, virtuality, allow continuous and infinite visions, different in size and content. Space is represented through a succession of different realities that no longer depend on the classic notion of Time. In this way the space is defined in that representation that multiplies its image, preserving its identity and aura. Dynamism passes from the purely abstract and symbolic season of literary and pictorial movements to a visible physicality and real concreteness, becoming an expression of the identity of space. Thus, while the narrative plots become a necessary language to be investigated, the cinematographic sequences of cinematographic genre take on a relevance that goes far beyond mere representation, responding to the need to read and see all the possible realities. The moving ima-ge broadens the vision of physical space because the senses also perceive the characteristics and aesthetic and functional qualities that space is able to assume and transform over time. Every single frame detects and documents the actions of space and time. This work is a study on the design of space in movement through tne notions of time and space.

As a result, several factors, if not well-organized and taken into consideration in the strategic development plans of the host cities, may be a burden on the city. Site selection for the event is considered one of the main critical decisions to assure the possibility of the host of the Games by the city. Therefore, this paper reviews several case studies that proved its success in location choice under the delivery of sustainable urban design and strategic planning for the host city.

Due to HIV/AIDS-related stigma being prevalent in many societies today, many infected people would rather not disclose their status than deal with negative labelling and stereotyping. This study utilised narrative inquiry as a qualitative research design that is known to be a way of understanding experiences. Data was elicited via narrative interviews from a purposeful sample of ten principals and eight teachers living with HIV who were selected through network sampling from Gauteng public urban schools. The study found that stigma, fear of job loss and gossip deterred teachers from disclosing their HIV status. In some instances, they disclosed due to needing support, which principals provided in the form of counselling, and also to explain absenteeism. Although principals supported disclosure of teachers’ HIV status so that they could initiate care, confidentiality concerns showed that disclosure could further worsen stigma and the culture of discrimination and moral judgement that teachers living with HIV faced. The study recommends on-going development of caring relationships to deepen the understanding of the experiences of teachers living with HIV. Nondisclosure of HIV status stands in the way of building caring relationships between teachers and principals.

It is seen as the core of a city which functions as a focal point in the public space network, providing a space for the community social interaction. However, many of the new public spaces in the 20th century has been a void setting and unsuccessful to create a public open space for social interaction that is vibrant with life. The notion of square was adopted from the European culture as far back as 17th century and has been adapted in Malaysia. This could be seen in today’s square design in Malaysia. However, the behaviour pattern indicate otherwise as the present day square design does not respond to the local climatic context with lack of shaded areas. Hence, people tend to avoid social interactions in public square during daytime due to undesirable weather condition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the positive aspects of traditional square that has been successful in supporting the community social interaction, and establishing a general guide for the design of new square as a public open space in Malaysian context. Amongst the consideration to be derived from this adaption is the Malaysian local context in terms of historical significance, culture and climate. Dutch Square in Melaka Historical Town was chosen as the case study, because it represents a model of traditional square as a public open space that still functions in term of attracting people to this day. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches were used in this study. Behavioral mapping allowed for statistical analysis where as observation and still photography as the descriptive to support the outcome of behavioural mapping. Therefore, the data collected are more reliable and able to be cross checked for further examinations of the findings. Findings showed that the relationship of the urban context and social behaviour are associative with one another. The square plays an important role to provide a setting in the built environment and the behaviour pattern and activities to determine the success of the square as an open public space. The aim is to provide an appropriate public open space in the built environment that is robust and meaningful to the community. © BEIESP.","Behaviour; Landscape; Man-environment; Public Square",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066984576

Identifying urban mobility as an ideal starting point to discuss the potential overlaps between engineering and choreographic thinking, we briefly outline the notion of sustainability as it pertains to a key area of city engineering–urban transport. Arguing that transport is one of the most critical issues in creating socially and environmentally sustainable urbanism, we draw on studies of engineering to show how its working cultures and epistemologies prevent it from undergoing the transformation that would allow it to effectively address the issues posed by sustainable transport. The focus of the paper is what we believe to be a comprehensive survey of the few conceptual and practical experiments that have been undertaken in using choreographic techniques to explain or design the way people move in cities, in scholarship and design practice. We conclude by arguing that there is great potential to expand on these experiments as ways to address the cultural and epistemological limits within engineering, and calling for practice-based research that shows what impact this would have on its processes and outcomes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dance; Engineering; sustainability; urban transport","conceptual framework; infrastructural development; research; sustainability; urban development; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060876624

Having this in mind, together with the voice of the persons with blindness or having greatly reduced vision, and taking into account the chaos in the markings in public space that were supposed to improve the way the persons with disabilities move, it is necessary to design and implement the adequate standards on the roads and in the streets.

About 1.8 million of them are people affected by blindness, partial blindness or low vision, who at the same time are active participants of the public space and of the road traffic.

Monarchies were replaced with more democratic systems, countries lost their territories, and new sates based on national principle were established. In 1918, after a period of ethnic oppression and magyarization in the Hungarian part of the Habsburg Empire following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the Bohemian and Slovak people declared their independence and founded a new national state - the Czechoslovakia. The period short after its foundation was one full of enthusiasm and joy stemming from the newfound freedom and opportunity for cultivation of national culture, identity and politics in democratic environment on the one hand, and challenges brought by the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian economy and political system on the other. As a result of establishing the new state, the need arose to define its nation by architecture and the issue of National Style reemerged. After the brief period of Rondocubism preference, for some time, the official buildings retained certain expressive character and massive features. Even after giving way to Modernism, the sense of traditionalism was evident. In the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, bank buildings, as buildings of institutions that once supported national-emancipatory aspirations of Slovak people, bank architecture often used well-established schemes and preferred more traditional designs to convey desired messages. The institution in charge of monetary separation and management of the new currency was the Banking Office of the Ministry of Finance and subsequently the National Bank of Czechoslovakia (since 1926). After the collapse of Austro-Hungarian Empire, all the buildings of branch offices of the former central bank - the Austro-Hungarian Bank - were took over by the Czechoslovak government. These were often extended, as were the cases of branch office buildings in Bratislava, Košice and Žilina. When they no longer fitted the formal or capacity criteria, three new branch office buildings were built on the territory of present-day Slovakia: a neo-renaissance building in Banská Bystrica (Ladislav Skřivánek, 1930 - 1932) and two buildings in the style of regional modernism with notes of traditionalism and classical features in Ružomberok (Vladimír Fischer, 1930 - 1932) and Bratislava (Emil Belluš, 1936-1938). The article examines stylistic, ideological, formal, and layout requirements for an architectural concept of a central bank institution demonstrated on the examples of branch office buildings built during existence of the First Czechoslovak Republic in the territory of the present-day Slovakia. As a part of a systematic research focused on Slovak bank buildings, the chosen buildings will be analysed, compared with relevant examples, and interpreted in the context of political, social, and economical situation, and style and typological particularities. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economics; Office buildings; Urban planning; Architectural concepts; Czechoslovakia; Democratic systems; Economic climates; National cultures; New branches; Political systems; Systematic research; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062382914

This bay is also famous for many floating fishing villages where the people live together on the sea as a community. However, due to rapid population growth in the floating villages, the present situation shows lacks in urban planning, waste management and development of infrastructure. Ha Long Bay had suffered the pressure of environmental pollution and resource degradation. Since 2014, in order to protect the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the local authority has planned a project to demolish the floating villages and move these communities to the mainland. In fact, the demolition project has caused the loss of cultural heritage and a tourist attraction in Ha Long Bay. The goal of this study is to propose a sustainable concept of living space organization for Cua Van, the largest floating village in Ha Long Bay, in order to preserve, revive, and promote floating communities as a unique heritage culture and tourist attraction. Therefore, a detailed analysis of environment and socio-cultural, economic, architectural characteristics of Cua Van is provided in this study. The analysis does not only accumulate precious traditional values that need to be preserved and developed in the proposed concept but also illustrate its weakness that need to be addressed to optimally design the future sustainable floating village. Based on these studies, as well as on general principles of a sustainable floating community and promoting ecotourism, the study proposes a living space concept for Cua Van, including solutions to both a sustainable floating community adapting to climate change and ecotourism development. The proposed concept would ensure stable and permanent living on the water for water dwellers and reduce human-induced impacts on the environment as well as an increasing livelihood income by tourism development. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Ecotourism; Floating villages; Sustainable floating community",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098002125

Currently, researchers and practitioners are increasingly focusing on creating conditions for the socialization and integration of people with disabilities. A large number of people, and above all, children with mental, emotional, and other disorders, need to organize an environment designed for inclusive interaction. Materials and research methods. The work used the method of analysis of scientific approaches to designing the environment. The main tools used were scientific data obtained by psychologists, architects, designers of the XX - XXI centuries, studying the optimal parameters of objects and spaces that affect the well-being and mental state of people of various categories. Processing of the data was carried out as part of a humanitarian approach; the method of content analysis was used. The results of the study. The work summarizes and systematizes the results of humanitarian studies for their subsequent, conceptual, and responsible use in technological projects to create a neuro-accessible educational environment, taking into account the needs of people with disabilities. The concept of a ""neural accessible medium"" is introduced, i.e., environment adapted for finding and activity of people with various mental disorders. Discussion. The concept of the educational environment includes not only the relationship of a child with disabilities with other people but, first of all, the spatial and material structures that organize the educational process. The search for ideas and technologies should be based on proposals for the maximum correspondence not only of the external shell but also of the structure of subject forms to the physical structure of a person as a natural being; about the integrity of the environment; about the need for ""following nature"". Creating forms should include taking into account the needs of all users. Besides, designing a neural-accessible environment should use virtual and augmented reality. Conclusion. The need for a neurally accessible educational environment, taking into account the needs of people with disabilities, the complexity of its design requires the use of an interdisciplinary approach and the use of data from different disciplines and projects that currently exist autonomously from each other. In general, the described ideas can be useful not only in the educational environment but also in the working and urban environment. © 2019 LLC Ecological Help.

Margaret Mead, an American cultural anthropologist defined Culture as ""the whole complex of traditional behaviour which has been developed by the human race and is successively learned by each generation"". Such shared patterns on behaviour are largely influenced by the nature of spaces. Since architecture is the physical manifestation of culture, any change in the same has the power to gradually bring about a change in culture. Societies which have been closely knit have grown to be non-concerned of each other with changing design patterns. External influences on architecture and planning from different sources has been modulating the culture of places. And so, a conscious action towards conservation of culture can be strengthened by conservation of local architectural heritage. This important fact has been established in this paper through the study of urban planning and designs case studies through history of the city of Patna, Bihar, India.

Although the term is not new and appeared in the 70s, it is only now gaining popularity. This happens when humanity noticed that progressing technologization and urbanization leads to the breakdown of direct contact with nature, which may result in problems with good psychophysical condition of a human being. Considering biophilia in the context of architecture is therefore extremely important. In this approach, it is understood as the dependence of man on nature, which goes far beyond the reliance on the material and physical perception of the world. This dependence contains human desire for aesthetic, intellectual, cognitive and even spiritual experience and satisfaction. Biophilic design means, therefore, the search for a connection between people and nature, and architecture should be perceived in a more emotional way than merely physical. This reception takes place through our senses using all of them, not just sight. The importance of biophilia in the field of architecture was popularized by Dr Stephen R. Kellert, whose scientific and research activity deepened the subject of relationships between people and the natural world. The paper presents the most important assumptions of biophilic design with an indication of their specific applications in contemporary library buildings. It is in the libraries that for centuries have been the most important centers of urban culture, the author sees the greatest potential and at the same time a model example for promoting people well-being and healthy values of architecture. © SGEM2019.","Biophilia; Ecology; Energy and environmental design; Green design; Library; Sustainable development","Behavioral research; Ecodesign; Ecology; Libraries; Sustainable development; Biophilia; Direct contact; Human being; Library buildings; Natural world; Psycho-physical conditions; Research activities; Urban culture; Architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073325694

In general, cosmeticians have limited access to safety information about the hazardous materials they handle, which would potentially enable them to minimize workplace exposures. The problem is much pronounced in low- and middle-income countries due to weaknesses in regulation of the industry. We investigated determinants of exposures to hazardous materials among nail cosmeticians in Kampala District, Uganda. We employed a cross-sectional study design among a random sample of 243 participants. The sociodemographic characteristics, education and training status, knowledge about routes of exposure to hazardous chemicals, and personal protective material use of cosmeticians were assessed through face-to-face interviews. Most cosmeticians were aged 18-34 years, and more males were engaged in this work than females. Also, 82.7% believed inhalation was the major exposure route for the chemicals they handled. Participants who had attained secondary-level education and above were over three times more likely to wear masks (AOR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.58-6.41) and gloves (AOR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.55-7.81) and over two times more likely to use aprons (AOR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.18-5.32). Participants who had ever received safety training on hazardous chemicals were more likely to wear all four personal protective equipment: masks (AOR = 3.21, 95% CI 1.61-6.42), gloves (AOR = 4.23, 95% CI 2.05-8.75), goggles (AOR = 4.14, 95% CI 1.25-13.65), and aprons (AOR = 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.96). Participants who had spent more than two years in the nail cosmetics business were more likely to wear masks (AOR = 3.37, 95% CI 1.64-6.95). With the increasing demand for nail cosmetics, and many people in urban areas of low-income countries engaging in this industry, there is need for training and better workplace policies to promote a healthier urban workforce dealing in cosmetics. © 2019 John C.

Some of these beliefs are based on actual proven and solid foundation. Some of them are superstitions which are baseless and have been accepted by people. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of belief in superstitions and its related factors among the students of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences. Material and Methods: This was a study with mixed method design which was a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative section was cross-sectional and the qualitative part of the study included views of the experts on the psychological, social, religious and political fields. In this study we used a valid and reliable researcher-made superstition questionnaire. The questionnaire had 2 parts: belief in superstitions and tendency to superstition. We used stratified random sampling method and the sample size was estimated to be 386 students according to Cochran's formula. Data were entered into SPSS-20 software and analyzed by ANOA and chi-square test. Results: In this study 184(54%) students were male and 157 (46%) were female with the mean age of 20.26 ± 1.60 years. 309 students (90.6%) lived in urban areas, 54 (15.8%) had a tendency to superstition, 46 (13.5%) had high level and 122 (35.8%) had low level of superstitious beliefs. In this study, there was a significant relationship between gender (P=0.037) and age (p<0.001) with belief in superstitions. In addition, there was a significant relationship between residential area with tendency to superstition and belief in superstitions (p<0.001), while, there was no significant relationship between gender and tendency to superstition (P=0.861). Conclusion: Considering the high frequency rate (64.2%) of belief in superstitions among the students as future community makers, comprehensive planning to decrease belief in superstition by means of various systems, such as universities, television and other relevant organizations, is essential. © 2018 the Author (s).","Belief in superstitions; Students; Superstitions; Tendency to superstition","adult; age; Article; cross-sectional study; female; gender; human; male; qualitative research; questionnaire; residential area; sample size; social belief; student; superstition; urban area; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061713136

Sonic environment consisting of various sounds ranging from music and natural sounds to artificial sounds is an integral part of any geography. It is a reflection of people living in the location as well as an influencer of culture in that location. To assess the perception of a person or people of context offered by that location, a soundscape assessment is performed that majorly involve Likert-based questions for pleasantness, annoyance, appropriateness, and so forth. We propose a qualitative method to assess soundscapes from a cultural point of view derived and tweaked from existing methods and tools like the Swedish soundscape quality protocol (SSQP). The method stands as a counterpart of qualitative soundscape assessment approaches like the SSQP, however, it provides richer insights into the perception of the soundscape with its effects, sound characteristics, and cultural meanings. The developed method is also deployed to a field study in Phulenagar, an urban slum of Mumbai. Regions such as these, occupied by people of low socioeconomic stratum have rich sonic interactions because of small residences and proximity of residences. They also offer rich soundscape which is created and affected by sounds generated from various cultural, social, and economic sources and activities.

These interaction flows are considered smart for making strategic use of infrastructure, services, information and communication with urban planning and management to meet social and economic needs of society. According to Berrone (2016), the 10 dimensions indicate the level of intelligence of a city: governance, public administration, urban planning, technology, the environment, international connections, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. Thus, this study is proposed here address two of these topics: governance and economy. To Araúhajo (2002), the term governance as the ability of a government has to design and implement their policies this ability refers to the financial sphere, managerial and technical, while governance implies the conditions the exercise of political is based on the analysis of these dimensions that see the role of social cohesion so necessary for the construction of a structure and culture of smart cities. Once appropriating this culture, economic development will be the reflection of that interaction. According to Nakagama, cases successful in smart cities as Australia, show that generating real business results of short-term, especially as the government encouragement (tax incentives and access to credit), provides a creative economy, able to retain talents in local companies with good revenue. Thus, this paper aims to make a thematic focus on what public policy strategies that drive the construction of smart cities in order to verify the impact of public policies and this study the importance of public engagement in governance: identify talent retention strategies and analyze the socio-economic development. Thus, a descriptive and exploratory methodology grounded in case study of governance practices in Australia will be applied, these practices opposed to the Brazilian. © 2017 IEEE.","Economic Development; public Policies; Smart Cities","Economics; Public administration; Public policy; Smart city; Taxation; Urban planning; Design and implements; Economic development; Information and communication; Policy strategies; Public engagement; Retention strategies; Social cohesion; Socio-economic development; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057074201

Its characteristic feature is the extension of both, recognized as ""urban"" functions, as well as the group of recipients on which the created space is to interact. The direct connection between the notion of a city created by people (polis) and the animal world (zoo) was a long-lasting, multi-faceted process of broadening the meaning of animal subjectivity in culture, art and politics. The very concept of zoopolis, appearing for the first time in the work of Donaldson and Kymlicka in 2011, was initially applied to political science, in the context of places shared by man and domestic animals, where the city was understood as a political community of its inhabitants, including non-humans. In the sphere of creating physical space, this concept appeared for the first time two years later thanks to Jennifer Wolch. In terms of zoopolis, the urbanized space will be a set of parallel worlds in which both people and nature live in the same area, whose multiple layers only sometimes cross or overlap. The purpose of the work is to allow tracing the main determinants of the transformation process of contemporary policy from small point elements to systemic actions and identify the main features of a non-anthropocentric city as a place for the emergence of new functions and urban forms. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Animals; Architecture; Construction; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Domestic animals; Long lasting; Multiple layers; New functions; Political science; Small points; Transformation process; Urban form; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053143772

This volume does not examine buildings as architecture, but adopts an archaeological perspective to consider them as artefacts, reflecting the needs of those who commissioned them. Studies have often failed to consider the historical contexts in which the buildings were constructed and how they were subsequently used and interpreted. The papers in this volume situate their interpretation in their social context. Buildings can inform us about past cultures as they are responsive and evolve to meet people’s needs over time. The buildings examined in this volume range from the twelfth to the twenty-first century and cross continents including case-studies from America, Australia and Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean. Themes include: Approaches to the study of buildings, Buildings of Power, Buildings in Identity, Domestic Space and Urban and Village Spaces. The essays consider building design, role, and how the buildings were altered as their function changed to coincide with the needs and aspirations of those who owned or used the buildings. This collection of papers emphasizes the need for further international multidisciplinary approaches including archaeology, architectural history and art history in order to understand how ideas, styles, approaches and designs spread over time and space. Together, these papers generate valuable new insights into the study of buildings in the historic period. © Archaeopress and the authors 2018.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114582840

The result can be places that are again more a manifestation of planning principles and generalised design strategies than integrating urban cultures and communities. Without inclusion of the attributes that people want to preserve, adapt, rehabilitate, or even reconstruct, public space may present a missed opportunity to produce specific, beautiful places. Careful approaches to existing structures provide a sense of continuity, comprehensibility, meaning-fulness, and coherence – the values of importance beyond aesthetic satisfaction.

By promoting the knowledge and enrichment of cultural heritage, it is possible to design a 'public domain supply chain' which can exploit different cultural and social actions. In its early stage, this project offered people a number of educational and entertaining events which were related to the works of the authors who gradually entered into Public Domain. The public domain #open festival was organized for the first time in Italy in 2016 with the aim of extending the range of action of previous experiences. In 5 days a total amount of almost 50 special events (conferences, meetings, workshops, exhibitions, shows, theatrical readings, etc.) related to art, photography, music, literature, theater, cinema and more were offered. This festival was like a party; a large container where everyone was able to learn the meaning and the different facets of public domain (and the cultures related to openness) by appreciating its ethical and economic value in any field of human knowledge.

Established during the Korean War (1950–1953) while Busan was the city with the most war refugees, the market is a significant historic place that is imbued with a unique culture created by the people who have sustained the market over the past 60 years. This chapter highlights the significance of the market’s historical particularities and authentic sense of place, which are reflective of the people who have inhabited the marketplace. It also problematizes the outward-looking nature of the Jagalchi Market Modernization, which is represented by the architectural design of the new Jagalchi Market building and the street renovation project targeting outside visitors, and it discusses the unique sense of place that was either neglected or compromised during the process of market modernization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Collective place experience; Sense of place; Traditional market modernization; Urban design",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060580442

Fabricam is unfolding in a setting subject to a general resentment of any symbolic representation of the state (e.g. public space) and a lack of culture for engaging in communal self-organization and action. As such, the hypothesis is that engaging citizens in each step of the design process facilitates common understanding of genuine and most pressing desires for public space.

Changes of situation in the community, such as relocation, was considered a threat. In Indonesia, especially DKI Jakarta, in order to implement the Urban Environment Management Program, the government relocated the community who occupied illegal land to simple rental flat (rusunawa). People who were impacted by this policy had to adjust themselves to the new environment to make living, and some other chose to stay in a modest flat. The concept of community resilience has been an interesting issue as it dealt with the ability of something, someone or even society in overcoming difficulties, to recover and return to normal conditions at the right time. This study was done to propose a conceptual framework for community resilience for the residents of modest rental flats and to determine a standard method to examine the community resilience among residents of modest rental flat who were impacted by the relocation policy. Literature review was done to obtain secondary data and relevant scientific literature. In addition, observations were done to several modest flat which were established prior to the relocation policy (Marunda, Rawa Bebek and Kapuk Muara Penjaringan). To measure the strength and direction of the independent variable's contribution to the dependent variable, Variance Based Structural Equation Modeling was administered using the Smart-PLS program. The proposed conceptual framework for community resilience among the residents of modest flat covered 8 (eight) aspects, namely: 1) economy; 2) social; 3) culture; 4) human resources; 5) ecology; 6) physical; 7) politics and government and 8) technology. Those aspects should be taken into consideration in order to increase the capacity of modest apartment to stay. For the government or policy makers and information planners, the proposed framework can be used as an input for policy making, determining the priority scale, fund allocation and the enhancement of the sustainable flat housing development programs. © 2018 Authors.","Community; Modest rental flat; Residents; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059289627

The first is to renounce any specialized approach that is based on an acritical confidence in the power of science and technology to solve the complex problems of today’s world, particularly those that concern the environment and the poor. The second is to adopt an approach based on a “culture of care” for nature and for the most vulnerable people, and third approach is to include people (especially those who are weakest) in transparent decision-making processes that affect the quality of their lives. Starting from these suggestions, and from Renzo Piano’s statement that, at present and in the future, “the mission of architecture is to save the outskirts” through “a huge work of mending”, we believe that researchers should, with humility, make use of the ‘urban-mending’ approach when dealing with the complexity of regeneration projects. At the levels of both the architectural project and urban planning, they should adopt an integrated, interdisciplinary approach that is lighter and more sensitive than those used in the past. This will help them to face up to the multidimensionality and complexity of redeveloping peripheral areas. All stakeholders, especially the weakest people in society, should be empowered and involved in public decision making and planning implementation. Finally, genuine participation of the marginalized, excluded and disaffected inhabitants of peripheral areas (i.e., the outcasts) can be achieved using a “deliberative-democratic” approach. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Evaluation; Inclusion empowerment; Urban distressed areas; Urban mending; Urban regeneration project","Decision making; Urban planning; Architectural projects; Decision making process; Evaluation; Public decision makings; Science and Technology; Urban distressed areas; Urban mending; Urban regeneration; Empowerment; Historic center; Stakeholders; Behavioral research",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051843451

It is a productive resource and vital to its environment, agriculture, industry, energy, household, transportation, generation, culture and recreation. It plays a significant role in people’s lives and a city’s shape. Generally, rivers can be considered the center of the city’s evolution, but nowadays river connection among cities, societies, cultures and the environment is unclear. One of the city’s major problems, especially in third-world nations, is ‘dead rivers’ or ‘forgotten rivers’, which become sources of pollution and disease, forming a dead path, fragmenting communities, degrading biodiversity, with urban encroachment, the absence of a healthy environment and the loss of community aesthetic value. This paper envisions that negligence of rivers can be one of the most important causes for the death of a city, whereas the revival of rivers has become a must for cities targeting re-living and development. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an urban strategy, as a solution to revive the forgotten rivers, through creating a cultural promenade on its shore. Beirut River in Lebanon is a forgotten river that burdens Beirut city with a lack of any decent quality of life, a dead polluted space, a forgotten area fragmenting the city, which should be the main potential gathering space for nature, tourism and investments. As a case study, this paper investigates Beirut River through urban and ecological analyses, aiming to design an urban strategy for reviving it by creating a cultural promenade enriched with public spaces and green areas, which can most probably enhance the quality of life in the city. The paper ends with a set of conclusions, stating that focusing on a forgotten river and turning it into a sustainable basin may rehabilitate its city and reform its identity. © 2017 WIT Press.","Architecture; Culture; Forgotten river; Landscape; Promenade; Revival",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047909283

The current emphasis on the benefits of parks is understandable in the light of environmental issues such as, inter alia, earth warming threatening humankind's existence on the planet. By the 1970s, there was already a substantial canon of literature on urban parks. Since then, a new generation of urban environmental historians has emerged with new interests and approaches. It is therefore prudent to revisit the thinking and aims inherent in the early establishment of the urban parks of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Britain and the United States of America. The aim of this paper is to explore both the views of middle and upper class urbanites in Britain and the USA on the mostly harsh living conditions in their cities, labelling them as ""evil""; and the establishment of parks being seen as one solution to alleviate said conditions. The paper also focuses on how ideas on ""nature"", ""progress"", ""health"", ""morals"", ""romanticism"", ""social control"" and ""middle class respectability"" underpinned views on public parks as pristine rural environments that should be transferred to the city. Lastly, the way landscape designers echoed the ideas and aspirations of the middle class in the design of parks is considered. Rapid industrialisation and urbanisation led to a lack of connection between urban residents and previous rural/natural areas and their benefits. The perception was that this, in turn, contributed to the decline in moral and physical health and the eroding of culture. The rural environment was idealised and seen as inherently good and superior to city living. If transferred to the city, it could create an ideal urban environment. Fredrik Law Olmsted, the doyen of American parks, fully supported these views. By the turn of the 19th century, the permanence of the city was well established and perceived dichotomy between the urban and the rural resolved by a hybrid relationship. As England was the leader in die development of parks, it had a huge influence in the Western world with many countries tapping into English ideas on parks. However, from the 1850s there was thus a lively cross-fertilisation of ideas on the urgency of park development. The City Beautiful movement would have a significant influence on these dominant ideas on parks. The ""problems"" to which the provision of parks was expected to offer some relief, were easy to describe: ill-health, overcrowding and squalor. The reasons for addressing these problems were various. The breathing space parks could provide was seen as one solution to improve the health of those living in over-crowded conditions. During the middle to late 19th century the British government expressed concern about the lack of exercise amongst its citizens. Initially, the park was seen as the ideal urban space for contemplative recreation and an escape from the harsh city environment. However, by the turn of the 19thcentury park advocates called for active recreation. They believed that there was a connection between poverty amongst the working classes and a lack of fitness. Fundamental to this was the hope that exercise in the park could contribute to a more productive working class. By the 1930s parks as spaces for exercise were well established in Europe and the USA. This first era of park establishment in the Western world was heavily influenced by the interests of the city elite and middle class reformers. They viewed themselves as the keepers of respectability, ""civility"" and ""civilization"" and the driving force behind reform and progress. The target of ""improvement"" was the working-class and the ideal place the city parks. By ""civilizing"" the masses, there would be fewer encroachments on middle class sensibilities. Moral reformers claimed that the health-giving character of parks provided an alternative to ""urban vices"" by bringing the poor into visual contact with respectable bourgeoisie behaviour. In addition, parks offered strategic spaces to provide a safety valve for social upheaval. By controlling how, when and where parks were provided the middle class could supervise the working class in their non-work hours and attempt to control their behaviour. Consequently, urban parks became socially constructed spaces. Park design reflected the ambitions and beliefs of especially middle and upper class city dwellers. The vision was to introduce to the city spacious green spaces where city dwellers could delight in the beauty of nature, fresh air and healthy exercise. Generally, park designers demonstrated their conviction of the historical inevitability of the permanence of the city but also that city living could be pleasant. Tapping into the 18th century English landscape gardening movement landscape architects applied the same basic use of trees, grass and water, suitably modified for mass usage. The aim was to link green spaces to utilise the ecological value thereof and simultaneously create a work of art. The layouts were contrived with great insight into human needs and behaviour, fostering gentle promenading and inducing the park visitors to forget their mundane concerns. Later parks made provision for active recreation. The characteristics of the designs varied. On the one hand the romantic idea of a pristine wilderness prevailed while on the other hand pastoral parks were laid out. Mostly it was a combination of both. Olmsted and Vaux opted to contrast wilderness vistas with more subtle arrangements to express their vision of the ""picturesque"". Urban parks became the ideal location for the erection of scientific and cultural exhibitionary complexes, becoming the repositories for glasshouses, monuments, art galleries, museums and sculptures mostly commemorating conspicuous political and cultural people. Two further prominent characteristics were the military parade grounds and the elaborate entrance gates. Hence parks fulfilled an educational and ennobling function becoming an essential feature of the urban fabric. They grew into powerful symbols of civic pride, community spirit and expressions of civil identity. However, whilst parks contributed to the improvement of living conditions in the city, the realities of the city's manufacturing and trading character prevailed. Thus, it remained difficult to completely marry the agrarian deference for nature with the fundamental character of the city.","Evil of the city; Green spaces; Health; Middle class; Morality; Nature; Overcrowding; Park design; Relaxation; Respectability; Romanticism; Social control",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026763629

Each of the arches selected for discussion incorporated Australian Indigenous people, buildings or artefacts, which were curated to convey carefully crafted narratives of colonisation. A raft of interpretations can be read into each of the arches because they are intentionally loaded with meaning and symbolism. Particularly evident are the notions of protectionism and assimilation, which were central to the settler colonial narrative. Understandings of the arches is framed by the interpretive information available about them–photographic documentation taken of the in situ arches, drawings and textual descriptions.

We like some cities and detest others. Despite shared rationalizations and common modes of administration and design, each city has its own culture. A culture is typically human in that it contains all dimensions of the human, personal condition--from the lowest to the most sublime. Urban culture comprises both economic and civic culture, and is the source of a city's vitality. For today's urban sprawls, which have a weak and failing economic and civic culture, the task of the urban administration and various economic and civic organizations is to strengthen conditions that can prevent the emergence of urban anomie. With suburbanization, the edge city, and the emergence of cyberspace, some argue that cities, as integrated places of working and living, are things of the past. Zijderveld argues that people are and remain social animals, who like and need one another's company, particularly in their economic, socio-cultural, and political activities. Throughout the ages, cities have provided the environment in which people fulfill these needs. Anton Zijderveld discusses urban preferences, the organizations and ramifications of urbanity, the modernization of urban culture, the uneasy alliance between urbanity and the interventionist state, and the cultural dimensions of urban renewal. Zijderveld sees the economic and civic culture of the city as the centerpiece of contemporary urban management and contemporary urban democracy. In this sense, the new technology is an ally of the new urban renewal. Most postmodern treatises on the end of the cityare impressionistic and unsystematic. In contrast, Zijderveld puts the qualitative dimensions of city life into focus, catching its pulse and cultural rhythms in a systematic context that prior studies have lacked. As such, it will be of great interest to urban administrators, p. © 2009 by Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083200971

Such activism can be viewed through several lenses, including labor organizing, the civil rights movement, voter registration efforts, parental involvement in schools, and urban renewal efforts, to name a few. Each of these efforts to engage specific communities has, over time, refined my understanding of how outside groups can engage communities struggling to empower themselves. And each effort enlightened my analysis of practical organizing for local power to participate in, and control, the decision-making and political activity that shapes communities’ lives. Some of these past organizing efforts operated independently, and some joined together to accomplish greater goals such as electing candidates, changing laws, protesting or influencing new policies. These targeted efforts to improve our democracy by creating unity and strength within communities also created an impressive record of historic milestones and real social transformations that still teach us fifty years later. Back then, in the 1960s, people were not only ready for change; they were also ready to struggle for that change. Unionizing, defeating segregation, and achieving voting rights inspired powerful rallying calls. Equal education for all was desired and with it came more effective organizing. Communities became more supportive of each other. Folks had a greater “we” consciousness, which helped to produce a shared aspirational and intentional energy, especially among marginalized and oppressed peoples. This common response to, and acceptance of, “we” consciousness helped support cultural influences that emerged in the period's art as well. Songs, dances, language, literature, film, design, and other forms of expression all became billboards for the aspiration that so many held. Movement and community-focused arts expressed the feelings of wanting better times and articulated the enduring sense of humanity and integrity that demanded better times (Zohar, 2014). Developing “we” consciousness also included accepting people from outside segregated and traditional communities who became allies and friends. But only after prolonged struggles and sweaty battles that drew blood and tears together did allies and friends become part of the “we” consciousness, adding new chapters to a community's culture. This level of solidarity, of collective identity, shared commitment and cause, demands a high cost, and not everyone who wants to work together or partner is willing to pay it. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048027505

The central challenge in linking culture and tourism lies in reconstructing the past in the through 'interpretation'. It is defined as a process of communicating to people the significance of a place through stimulating their understanding. Different approaches could be used to achieve this goal. A Tourist trail is one of the convenient approaches for realizing interpretation. It is an essential tool for enhancing tourists' experience and appreciation of old heritage by revealing the quality of a place. Both physical and non-physical aspects of cultural areas play a key role in supporting the interpretation qualities of the heritage trail. However, the design of tourist trails is directly affected by the qualities of the built environment which determine the choice of pedestrian route. This is considered to be the main concern of this research. This paper poses the question of how to design tourist trail based on examining the relation between the built heritage qualities and the tourists' route choice behaviour. It applies its approach to the Turkish Town-a historical part of the City of Alexandria-as a well-defined conservation area in the City. To answer the paper's question, a hypothesis was designed, taking in consideration the qualities that is responsible for enhancing interpretation, and managing tourist's experiences of place. Thus, the research follows a methodology comprised of a number of stages. The first stage investigates the qualities of the built heritage that have a direct effect on tourist's route choices. This is done to extract a number of criteria used as a benchmark for the analysis process. The second stage applies these criteria to the selected historical urban pattern. This is achieved through two analytical methods used during the evaluation process. The first method is the Space Syntax Theory to measure spatial configuration of urban spaces using both angular segment analysis and visibility graph analysis (VGA). The second method is a detailed field survey to examine each street segment's characteristics, objectively, in terms of its physical features. The research ends by performing data manipulations and analysis to propose optimal routes with interpretation qualities that facilitate tourists' navigation in the area as well as manage their experience. The preliminary findings imply the importance of using computer aided analytical tools as decision support systems for designing and manipulating tourist trails based on the built heritage qualities.","Built environment; Cultural tourism; Route choice behaviour; Street configuration; Tourist trail; Turkish Town","Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Syntactics; Built environment; Cultural tourism; Route choice behaviour; Tourist trail; Turkish town; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031088169

There are a lot of types of mobility model but we use Random Way Point (RWP) because it is simple, most common use and needs less memory and time for computation. The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city.

The social manners, customs, habits etc. are the principle elements with which these festivals are integrated. In Assam, Bihu serves as the most important marker of cultural assimilation that unites various indigenous groups and all such diverse constituents of Assamese community. It is a unified form of the folk songs, dances, musical instruments of the various castes, sub-castes and tribes of people, the inherent natives of Assam. As a form of performing art, folk festivals have always been an important part of culture and community life. With the onset of globalization several factors such as increasing human mobility, goods and ideas have led to the emergence of a multi-dimensional domain. In the post-industrial scenario, cities in India have become critical sites of negotiation and are expected to become some of the largest urban agglomeration of the twenty first century. This has created a pluralist identity resulting in a new multifarious culture pervading throughout the entire urban landscape. Festivals have transpired as the phenomenon of the city, and their presence in the everyday landscape weaves itself through the urban fabric dominating the popular visual culture of Indian cities. This in turn has left an imprint on the celebration of festivals like Bihu and Durga Puja providing a new dimension leading to the emergence of new vocabularies of celebration veering towards Public Design. These festivals have taken a particular installation art profile that exhibits the influences of various cultural elements. This can be broadly termed as ‘festivalisation’ of the city. They dominate the popular Visual Culture of Indian Cities giving a new dimension towards the study of Image making and Place making in present day Indian cities. This study was undertaken to explore and understand the anatomy of the newly emerged popular display of cultural elements which has given rise to new dimensions to Visual Culture in a semi-urban setting. This provides an evolution in Design thinking and Visual Culture where the vernacular practices of art and craft are brought into dialogue with the changing needs of modern cultural demands. It further leads one to analyze and observe how the artifacts associated with a folk festival reinterprets their symbolic meanings through various inter and intra cultural interactions over time. What role can the Designer play in branding these cultural phenomena while creating a unique identify of a city?. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cultural heritage; Cultural identity; Culture; Design thinking; Festival; Urban identity; Visual culture","Cell culture; Cultural heritages; Cultural identity; Design thinking; Festival; Urban identity; Urban growth",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018376571

By analyzing urban spaces it can be concluded that different cities have different urban spaces due to climate differences. One of the main reasons of the differences in the type and orientation of urban spaces is the climate as one of the key factors in designing these areas. Regarding climate in designing is equivalent to involving the users of the space, basically because climate adjustments can encourage more people to use the designed spaces. Hence, it can be said that climatic spaces are humanistic spaces as well. Therefore, climate directly influence culture and plays a decisive role both in the body and behavior of the users. Thus, it could have a very effective role in how people use or how they behave in designed spaces. Materials and methods: A mix of several methods has been used for more compatibility with research purposes. This used library documents and has a comparative-analytical method. The basic data and the research background information have been gathered through documentative method and from library resources. For the fieldwork, the descriptive method (describing the phenomenon) has been used. Then, people patterns of behaviors were studied by an interpretative-qualitative method in each climate to analyze and infer the discussions in order. And at last, a comparative method has been used to analyze the results in order to set out urban design criteria. In this comparative method, it was tried to compare people patterns of behavior in two cold-mountainous, and hot and humid climates, and to analyze its results to elicit criteria for urban space design considering the effects of climate on the user behaviors. In this research, the people behaviors were studied, analyzed and compared in two different seasons of the year (the hottest and the coldest seasons) by the use of serial photography. Thus, people different patterns of behaviors in different climates and the ways they use the spaces were investigated, by the observation a set of design criteria could be developed to be applied in the design/redesign of urban spaces to improve their qualities. (Figure Presented) The theory In general, people uses of urban spaces may have two stages: 1. Presence in urban space. 2. Tendency to continue to stay in the urban space. There are two kinds of qualities in urban environment. First, the qualities which are the main requirements of people presence in public spaces, i.e. primary qualities. Second, the qualities encouraging people to stay in the space for a longer time. Meanwhile, there are some qualities like climatic comfort which play effective role in both primary and secondary qualities. This very important factor is in full adaptation with human physical characteristics and is the main requirement of people presence in the space. It also plays an undeniable role in the way people use the space and behave there. Climatic comfort can increase the number of opportunities to use the space. If the space is designed with consideration of all aspects, including the user behaviors, it can be used by all people in various periods of time during the day, and in different seasons. Results and discussion: Design guidelines in hot and humid climate are formulated. They emphasize on the role of climate to determine people patterns of behavior. Here, regarding the achievements of local observations and the recognition, the design criteria are proposed at two different scales, the city scale and the site scale. A) The city scale: Location of the space in the shade: This is the most important factor affecting the use of space in hot and humid climates. If the open space includes shaded parts, people preference to stay there will increase. Therefore, location in the shade can be considered as an important requirement for people use of space in this climate. Other factor is natural ventilation and the space orientation parallel to the wind flows: This is the second factor affecting the use of public spaces in hot and humid climate. Natural ventilation of open spaces happens by the airflows coming from the sea. It helps the locals reduce the high unpleasant humidity in this climate, so it encourages passersby to stop and stay in the space. B) The site scale: • To avoid designing vast urban open spaces in hot and humid climate. • Making orientation of the open spaces toward the sea to moderate the hot weather and reduce the humidity by the sea airflows. Local observations also verify that successful spaces in this climate have perpendicular orientation to the sea to benefit from its cool airflows for natural ventilation. Formulating design guidelines in cold and mountainous climate emphasizes the role of climate to determine people pattern of behavior: Local observations in Shahr-E-Kord show that the two fallowing factors have determined the role of people use of space in cold and mountainous climate. 1-Maximizing the direct sunshine: It is a positive point for the open spaces in the cold winter weather of mountainous climate, because it helps the space to be more welcoming and favorable for people. 2-Not to be windward: This factor also has direct effect on how people attend and behave in the space. The researcher's observations and notes in cold and mountainous climate show that the spaces which are exposed to direct wind flows are not favorable for people. A) The city scale: • For designing open spaces and its proposed land uses, it is better to locate attractive uses at the southern and east-southern side of the space, because it helps to provide favorable sunlight for the space during cold winter days and facilitates the use of space for people. • In the cold and mountainous climate, it is better to design urban spaces in form of small squares because it reduces the entrance of wind flows and provides people with climatic comfort. It must be mentioned that vast squares in this climate can benefit from the increased direct sunlight and heat. But the effect of the increased airflows in these spaces is highly unfavorable and disturbs the climatic comfort. Thus, they are not recommended. B) The site scale: • It is better to design crowded spaces as semi-open spaces, because enclosed and covered spaces are more favorable in all seasons for their shelters from the sun, wind, rain and snow. • In cold climates, it is important to use types of plants which prevent spaces from undesired wind, while not casting shades during cold seasons, since trees can provide favorable shades for summer time. Conclusion: The results and findings of this research are presented in a set of operational and applicable recommendations, some of which might seem unimportant. But they are undeniably essential. Simple solutions for ordinary problems of existing urban spaces can lead to significant improvements in the space vitality and people social life. William White expresses the extract of his long term studies in one sentence: ""people seat where the seating exists."" This sentence might seem clear and typical, but it is very important and can notably change the life of a city. Thus, the simplicity of changes does not mean that they are inconsiderable. It might be possible to change the destination of a space simply by adding shelters and awnings or providing sunny spaces in cold and mountainous climates and shaded spaces in hot and humid ones.","Behavior patterns; Bushehr; Climate; Climatic comfort; Shahr-E-Kord",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012249735

Given the different positions of a site, various approaches are adopted to initiate or preserve memories in city. In this respect, time, sociohistorical memory, traditions, myths, historical layers, the places where our memories take shape, the cultural context of city and understanding landscape gain importance as mental facts. In spite of being incomprehensible, time induces resistance in human so as to increase human's tendency to control and dominate it. The mechanisms of such a control create the need to preserve (keeping or stopping time), to accumulate, and also for projection manifesting themselves in the form of such mechanisms as ""memory,"" ""retention,"" ""mental accumulation,"" ""dream,"" ""mental scenarios,"" ""ideal,"" ""desire,"" etc. in human life. The issue at hand is how the importance of collective memory can be brought up by landscape design in the quality of life, physical quality, and urban landscape. In certain cases, the site needs to be observed by a close encounter and its residents need to be interviewed. In other cases, palimpsest tools are employed considering the urban history. Any urban space in which an event has occurred and even all symbols and elements constituting urban spaces are the places for the accumulation of our collective memories. What matter here is to identify the elements, symbols, and criteria associated with collective memories by which factors of identity, sense of place, and attachment to the residence and urban spaces can be preserved, reinforced, or created in landscape design. The physical environment of city as the resource and the symbols of mental images and memories are especially formable. Every individual becomes attached to city given the memories one has from the urban landscape. Therefore, identifying the factors leading to the creation of memories and the relationship between urban landscapes and mental perceptions are essential ignoring which causes a cultural break. The relationship between mental perceptions, as a constant thing, and the physical structure of city, as a variable thing, creates a balanced space between city and collective memory causing people to partake in it. Hence, the urban landscape can function as a context for the formation of collective memories and the mental perceptions of its users. What matters is to identify the factors creating collective memories and its durability in environmental aspects and that whether adopting them in landscape design can prove to be effective in maintaining and enhancing cultural coherence, attachment to residence, and urban spaces. Thus, this can also improve urban landscape quality. Materials and methods: Given the information obtained from previous research and the identification of the scope of study, certain methods were selected to achieve research objectives. Landscape is analyzed and perceived using all human senses. There are two approaches for landscape analysis, namely descriptive and perceptive. The emphasis, in this study, is placed on landscape analysis on the basis of people mental structures. Interviews were conducted in order to find out what existed in the minds of users of the space. In this regard, the landscape analysis method (using interviews and questionnaires as tools for identifying people's mental perceptions of the urban landscape as well as finding out the factors creating collective memory) was adopted. To conduct the interviews, local residents who lived in the area under study (Tajrish neighborhood) and were familiar with the history of the neighborhood were taken into consideration. Snowball sampling was used for identifying them Considering the landscape analysis method being perceptive and mental, six images from memorable spaces of Shemiran were prepared at first to begin working with the questionnaires. Given the studies carried out, certain components were then considered for each image in order for the viewers to score them given the impression they receive from each image (l=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=no comment, 4=agree, 5=strongly agree). In doing so, the images were black and white so that visual beauty would not influence the viewers and they would answer the questions bearing in mind what the images are associated in their minds and merely through their impression of the space. The questionnaires were distributed among 30 persons who were at least 30 years old. According to the results, the factors affecting the mentalities were extracted. Results and discussion: Given the studies and the information obtained through interviews with the sample population, a mental map was obtained for the residents of Tajrish neighborhood (Figure 1). The map shows indeed that natural, artificial, and mental elements leave durable effects on people's minds each in its own specific way. Depending on the conditions of the time and place in which a person lives, certain components are of importance. The existence of the factors can cause durable memories with attachment to place, formation of new memories, and cultural coherence. (Figure Presented) On the other hand, given the analysis of the results of landscape scores, we obtained the effectiveness of each of the components on mental perception in the urban landscape of Tajrish neighborhood. On this basis, the elements and symbols existing in the landscape leave the greatest positive effect on mental perceptions compared with other factors. The most important components are gardens, buildings, and old streets with their specific vegetation with 100%, alleys within gardens with 96%, and rivers with 93% of effectiveness. In this respect, Rachel Gould and Chokor respectively consider historical symbols and pay attention to public demands as well as the symbols they have in their minds to be among the most important issues for perceiving urban landscapes. In Belanger's view, places as historical neighborhoods can be replete with symbols. This leads to the creation of collective memories that their results are the development of common values. The next factor that its components play an important role in landscape perception is attachment. This prefers a certain landscape over another with 88%, the feeling of happiness therein with 74%, recalling memories by visiting the place with 67%, a feeling of nostalgia with 54%, and convenience with 53% of effectiveness. These had the greatest effect on people mental perception and demonstrated an attachment to that landscape given the collective memories shaped in urban landscapes. In the discussion about collective memories, the last factor affecting mental perception of the space is social relations. This causes what happens to the landscape in future to be of great importance to all residents with 92% of effectiveness. Social relations take shape in spaces where there are interactions and relationships among people. In this regard, Schwartz considers the role of open spaces very important in improving the life of citizens and increased probability of memories being formed. Conclusion: The methods adopted in this study help find a mentality in people that articulates past memories and can be utilized to arrive at a social relationship between culture, environment, and landscape at the present time. This trend brings about a mental network of public perception regarding the environment and the landscape where they live the memories are mentally valuable even if no objective symbol has remained in over the years. According to the results, collective memories are directly related to a number of factors including identity and culture, memory and time, social memories, palimpsest, urban landscape as well as its constituting elements. In view of the context in which the memories have taken shape, taking these relationships into consideration leads to the identification of mental factors and criteria that have enormously contributed to the formation of collective memories. Finally, the elements and components were obtained that were employed to achieve the best pattern to perceive the urban landscape (Tajrish neighborhood). Considering the achievements of this study and the characteristics of the site, propositions are put forward. Use of the propositions can play a significant role in increase of landscape quality, attachment, preservation of past memories, and formation of new ones in similar sites: 1. Use of elements and symbols that are effective on the formation of memories and mental perceptions. These are including use of elements such as plane tree, creation of spaces resembling fruit gardens of the past, creation of spaces for enhancing people socialization, planting plane trees in a row like Valiasr Street and the creation of a relationship between the landscape of mountain and river, use of watercourse as a natural element in design instead of hiding. 2. Creation of spaces for social interactions: These are including creation of social-gathering spaces and hangouts, creation of spaces for holding national and religious ceremonies, creation of spaces for holding seasonal exhibitions and events that attract families to urban spaces, use of appropriate urban furniture. 3. Enhancement of natural context: these are in view of the natural context of the site, considering the slope, height difference of surfaces, and the vegetation used in design, embedding a pool that initially purifies the collected runoff to some extent and then directs it toward the watercourse.","Collective memory; Mental perception; Tajrish; Urban landscape",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012248727

Indeed, most people on the planet now live in cities. For some commentators, the ‘urbanization of the world’ has the potential to pull people out of poverty, foster innovation and create the conditions for liberation. Utopian ideals have long been influential in attempts to design and build cities that are equitable and democratic as well as aesthetically pleasing. Many observers, however, are less optimistic, fearing that the dominance of the urban poses a considerable threat not only to the social and environmental sustainability of individual cities, but also to the future of the world. They argue that the degraded and indulgent landscapes of the city are the locales of displacement, disadvantage and inequality, irrevocably depleting the world’s resources and putting the very viability of the planet at risk. At the same time as such debates are being played out, however, it is important to remember that cities are also the spaces of everyday lived culture and the most intimate of experiences. They are resonant with memory and their places elicit a range of emotional responses and attachments that are collective as well as individual. Cities and urban development are thus replete with opportunities and difficulties, simultaneously sites of hope and fear. The task for urban scholarship is to engage with such complexities and contradictions in order to understand cities at both their micro and macro levels. The challenge for urban planners is to utilize the insights of this scholarship to ensure their practice is nuanced, sensitive and capable of shaping urban landscapes that are just and sustainable and support the dignity of all urban dwellers. © 2013 Greg Young and Deborah Stevenson.

The ‘cultural turn’ in town and spatial planning which emerged from the 1970s and 1980s has taken longer to establish itself than say in geography (Barnes 2001, Crang 1997), political economy (Soja 1999) and sociology (Chaney 1994). Planning as a hybrid practice has adopted culture - at least partially - to better inform more sustainable approaches to scarce land use and amenity needs and to respond to diversity and planning cultures. On the other hand it has also rediscovered culture in order to address aspirations and visions of city planning itself as a ‘work of art’ (Boyer 1988, Munro 1967, Talen and Ellis 2004). Different approaches and rationales for cultural planning have therefore emerged, rather than a single grand theory or conceptual model (see also Bianchini, Chapter 22, this volume). This is in part due to the epistemological and definitional differences evident in these approaches towards ‘culture’ and ‘planning’ and their combination, and in part to cultural politics that views the very idea of planning for culture as inherently instrumental in maintaining cultural and growth hegemonies - both market and state-led. Kunzmann’s aspiration (above) towards creativity in planning also conflates the practice of town planners withcomplex notions of city culture, environment and identity. The notion of the creative city has also extended the cultural planning sphere to the creative industries (‘economy’) and issues of place-making, design quality and sustainability. Place-making - like New Urbanism (CEU 2004) - whilst usefully focusing on the street, urban design, mixed-use, local accessibility, ‘sense of place’ and so on, can also be seen as a rejection or failure of planning in terms of the wider scale and the whole, distributed population (Evans 2010). Everywhere is a ‘place’, not just the valorized spaces which tend to feature in place-making agendas and guidance (APA 2011, Markusen and Gadwa 2010), and which are preoccupied with town centres and regeneration sites (physical, economy) at the expense of the everyday, residential areas and cultural activity (people). © 2013 Greg Young and Deborah Stevenson.

With evidence drawn from the formerly Latino neighborhood of Highland in Denver, Colorado, this ethnographic study demonstrates how the regulation of public space plays a pivotal role in neighborhood change. First, there is often a profound disharmony between how people from different cultural complexes interpret and sanction behavior in everyday public spaces. Second, because regulations, codes, urban design, and enforcement protocols are deliberately changed, commonplace activities longtime neighborhood residents feel they have a right to do along sidewalks and streets and within their neighborhood parks sometimes unexpectedly misalign with what is actually possible or legal to do in these publicly accessible spaces. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.","Gentrification; Governance; Neighborhood change; Public space; Urban planning; Urban sociology; Urban studies; US west",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028838331

The introduction of contemporary building materials and designs and novel research into the usage of space can be seen in diverse buildings in Perm, Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, Kurgan, Nizhny Tagil, Sverdlovsk, Zlatoust, Nadezhdinsk, and others. The social and artistic direction of Constructivism as an ultra-modern creative movement greatly influenced the new architectural look of cities in the Urals. It also transformed the language of architecture and the visual imagery of buildings: it allowed for the creation of new, unprecedented architectural types and changed people's ideas about convenience, style, and quality of life. From the mid-1930s until the early 1990s, many towns in the Urals were closed of to foreign researchers: the publication of books and articles about Constructivism was also prohibited.

Cities are the physical manifestation of the largest union of forces. Economic forces, social forces, environmental forces"". (Urbanized, 2011) Cities are explored as a critical component to transform human life, but when we talk about cities of the future, we mean that existing cities are not as blank pages but they are existing cites and our ability to transform them. We stand by this century will be the century of cities and the future of humanity will put into practice in them. Success of cities will lie in sustainability and environment. We must rethink the design of cities and approach to them from multiple perspectives and scales to recover their human side. This paper proposes a critic exploration of some of the tools we can use to plan the city of the future to get alliances between current cities and future cities. The conjoined actions of these alliances configures a strategy that makes possible these future cities to remain essentially successful throughout time. Thematically, the article begins with a dissertation about the Forum of Latin-American cities where aforementioned tools and other ideas to imagine the ways to change Ibero- American cities into innovative cities were debated. Next, the text examines the concept of sustainable cities and environment through various experiences in Mexico City to deduce, secondly, new ways of acting in the urban-design of cities. In order to sustain such argument, the paper proposes a review of cases to establish the viability of areas of collective use within both the geographic landscape and time. As a result, every concept is researched and put on an example of Mexico City. The first example of the research studies an architectural ensemble, formed by a garden and two residential buildings called Isabel and Ermita buildings and they were designed by Juan Segura Gutierrez in the first thirties of the last century. Residents used to share the common spaces in a natural environment and there, they created social structures that brought together. At the present time, that garden doesn't exit and the two buildings are tumbledown but the neighbors remind the daily nature character there used to be there, and they demand to get back into that routine because it is part of their collective imagination. Secondly, we will analyze a neighborhood called President Miguel Aleman designed with Modern Movement criteria by Mario Pani Darqui in 1949. This social condominium has public resources as swimming pool, tennis court, post office, laundromat and other installations. The film Elevator describes the evolution of the common spaces-inside and outside the residential buildings-and the current everyday life by elevator operator's testimony. The last Mexican example consists in a territorial landscape project called Mexico: Future City by a collective of citizens, architects, engineers, geographers, biologists, sociologists and specializes in other disciplines that propose the complex interactions of multiple scales between territorial and anthropomorphic to recover the originally lake system of the metropolis, across four strategies: water, territory, energy and public spaces. This global project tries to generate a new system of lakes fed by the waste water that take place in the capital and seeks to give solution to the problem. Methodologically, the research consisted on elaborating a database of good practices and selected sources from historical newspaper and periodicals library, social network, films and work in situ such as air-flies, interviews and inquiries related to the three Mexican examples and consequently synthesizes them in three deduced urban concepts. As a result, the research could obtain a timeline-poster to put on Latin American City. The present experience is a way of communicating urban history, an applied example of the use of the timeline through the history of Latin American City, on an urban example: Mexico City. The suitability of this method of research is justified in the concurrency of urban, architectural and social details and in chronological order. The timeline offers an alternative to the academic model and to the inherited learning process, which identifies and exposes the transversal possible strategies to transform Ibero-American City. The present article approaches three scales of the city, the first one is the scale of buildings, the second one relating to urban architectural ensembles and the last one in response to the territorial projects scale. The three scales must always improve and renew the public space and get the compactness of the city that has to offer to the users of urban projects that resolve their needs. We should not fear to turn urban highways into avenues or to re-formulate the shared spaces. Beside possessing the people, we will strain for realizing economically profitable practices, a solution to this problem is recycling -this suggests to transform our urban heritage, instead of demolish and build again. We will investigate the geography trying to revert the hurts caused to the environment. Our cities must take advantage of the resources and resign the culture of commanding discarded cards of an irrational way. Architecture and consistently City are inspired by nature that governs the and at the same time, nature offers architecture and city, the necessary instruments to give then harmony and form. The urban experimental spaces-as closed to the traffic streets during the weekends or the creation of new temporary topographies that are part of culture urban festivals- are contemporary urban actions that attract and assemble citizens. These kind of urban projects can transform cities as playful to support the festive environment during the accomplishment of an event and they can turn into a completely new way of working as urban designers by this methodology of large-scale work. The Architecture of Future City point to urban models that take advantage of the nature resources, offer solutions that respect environment and propitiate spaces of conviviality and social harmony. The main goal of this article is to discover the contemporary rules to put on practice in Latin- American Cities as Mexico City; therefore, the dissertation explores the urban evolution since the thirties to this moment through the study of three urban concepts: an idea of historical present, an idea of recovered city and the reversionary urban conversions. Metropolis will change this century into megalopolis ally with environment if they want to survive. Nature and citizens will be two of the highest players to encourage this sustainable revolution. © 2016 CIRIEC-España.","Historical present; Participatory urban design; Recycling; Reversibility; Sustainability; Water basins",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85001038059

In home culture research, Quitzau and Røpke has studied bathroom transformation from hygiene to well-being. Bathrooms are one of the rooms in apartments that do not have good solutions for small spaces. This is unfortunate since it is the bathroom that has the least amount of space in urban apartments. This leads many people to have too little bathroom space due to furniture, toilets, showers, etc. In today's society, the bathroom is no longer just a purpose room. It is used for relaxation and wellness. This has led to a trend where large furniture, such as freestanding bathtubs, dominate today's market. This in turn allows the few solutions that exist for small bathrooms to remain poorly conceived. The research question was therefore how to create solutions for small bathrooms to get the same sense of well-being as in larger bathrooms through universal design principals. The principles of universal design, observations and in-depth interviews were used in the study. This study can help to create a greater understanding of how to design small bathrooms. It will be relevant in a cross disciplinary field, including for professionals in plumbing, product design and technical solutions.

Accessing the basic opportunities of contemporary urban life now presupposes the supports and resources afforded by new mobilities, combining virtual and actual travel and communication in negotiating our work, leisure, connections with families, and culture. For the researchers applying the new mobilities paradigm, this requires a focus that is suited to capturing movement and its spatial and temporal coordinates and should also turn to illuminate the darker side of these relationships: coerced immobility experienced by people with disabilities. This chapter discusses an approach to research and the development of design scenarios - concepts emerging from research that may inform design - that take seriously the role of movement, time, and space in the achievement of valued connections by individuals with disabilities with particular reference to the journey to work. In particular we apply, in a case study, concepts of time and space that are relevant to the in situ experience of getting to work; raising questions regarding the way getting ready and travelling are experienced in the context of risk and contingency, and the actual and potential role of the technical, material, and social environment.

With a notion of legacy consisting of the collective heritage that encompasses the concepts of culture and memory, the experience of teaching is the appropriate setting for an informed debate about heritage values that pass down from generation to generation. This article intersects, in the preparation of architectural projects, the recognition of the value of heritage as belonging to the organizational, technical and artistic fields with the conceptions of “historical consciousness” and “tradition” from hermeneutic philosophy in the person of Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), so as to provide new results in relation to traditional approaches. In methodological terms, what is intended with these exercises is to enable students to develop a broad concept of heritage, where the idea of the recognition of its value allows a reading that includes the landscape as a whole. The results obtained show us that students deal with heritage through actions that include the restoration and rehabilitation of objects (buildings), but also through proposals where the organization and preparation of programmes articulated with each other, taking into account people, landscape and culture in the present, are concepts that are integrated in the projects. © 2015, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

We found that the basic need for a smart-car begins even before entering a car and is not confined to driving alone. Activities before and during driving cyclically impact each other. Moreover, we found that driving is not limited to users alone, but also involves critical participation from users’ social circles. From these findings, we discuss design implications that can impact pre-driving and while-driving modes and can thereby inform future research in smart-cars for urban India. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Qualitative research; Smart-cars; Ubiquitous computing","Behavioral research; Ubiquitous computing; Design implications; Driving behavior; Driving mode; Exploratory studies; On The Go; Qualitative research; Smart car; Social circles; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951105808

However, the vicinity of Shuangxiao Road fails to afford the comprehensive suburban function to coordinate urban areas with rural ones. This paper holds the opinion that Shuangxiao Road should not be treated as a road with only transportation function, but also a composite corridor and should play an important role in integrating urban and rural areas on landscape. Also, the concept ""Flow"" explains the crucial role of landscape corridor in suburban area. We investgate the situation along Shuangxiao Road and find out the superior resources, environmental problems and landscape potentials. Paying attention to important nodes and interfaces, with nodes renovation, facades reform and interfaces design, this paper tries to regenerate the existing corridor to a novel composite one.

To discuss the importance of tangible and intangible culture as a differentiating factor in building a visual identity associated with a site, since cultural diversity takes many forms across time and space. Currently, cities are constantly changing and cultural references have been become lost, yielding a loss of identity and relationship to the places. It is our duty as citizens to know and preserve our cultural heritage since it depicts our history and tradition while at the same time strengthens the feeling of belonging. According to the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (2002): cultural diversity contributes to a more satisfactory intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual existence and constitutes one of the essential elements in the transformation of urban and social reality. The Convention recognizes that the processes of globalization and social transformation (together with the conditions which contribute to a renewed dialogue among communities), cause serious threats to the disappearance or homogenization of cultural diversity. Culture constitutes the common heritage of humanity and should be recognized and affirmed for the benefit of present and future generations. Culture as transmitter of messages must be taken and understood as an essential element in the representation of a place. We must reflect the problem of the place as a public space, which is constantly changing, and the importance of the measurement of its history, culture and values as essential in the construction of its identity. The designer as project professional contributes to this cultural diversity to be understood and perceived by the largest number of people in order to preserve it at an intangible level. Design culture requires its observers to look beyond visual attributes and associate with the creation and dissemination materials. Culture is more than a pure visual representation and message transmission, rather culture formulate, formats, circulates, contains and retrieves information, and that culture takes diverse forms across time and space, constituting the common heritage of humanity and should be recognized and affirmed for the benefit of present and future generations. This article therefore intends to discuss the importance of preserving Culture Diversity, the importance of local culture, to see how it can survive and project globally without losing its identity. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Across the country, groups were able to develop specialized programs that reached traditionally underserved clients. A byproduct of many of the ADDGS programs was that they helped strengthen ties between communities and agencies, improving social services for both caregivers and people with Alzheimer’s. A New Look at Community-Based Respite Programs examines: the profile of the average respite care user different challenges faced by urban and rural clientele how culture and ethnicity influence health care decisions ways to involve communities in respite care how understanding patterns of use makes for better program design and implementation A New Look at Community-Based Respite Programs provides you with detailed analyses of a variety of successful support service plans, including mobile day care, Latino-specific outreach, traveling dementia evaluation teams, and programs designed for people who live alone. You’ll also read about the importance of complementing family caregivers instead of substituting for them. Throughout, helpful tables make the results of ADDGS programs clear.

The idea of promotion the cultural features within a public space helps to increase the city space attractiveness. The author presents the case study of a downtown area of a city of Poznan in Poland, Wielkopolska region. As a result of an observation that there is a lack of a public space of culture and art in Poznan city centre, there is presented a proposal of an innovative and attractive functions implementation. There is also presented the research method of public space activization through art and design. The art is understood not only as temporary events but as the pieces of a small architecture and built areas of a cultural function as well. There was created an idea of a MAD city for people - which means searching for meaning, action and design in a city centre space. This idea is to be used as a tool to identify the existing and potential space for art in a city centre and to define whether it is a space of sacrum or of profanum. The tool helps to define what is the best use and purpose of a space in a context of an art implementation. It is also to create a functional system of socially and spatially attractive public spaces within a city centre. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

Various geographical environments shape diversified customs and cultures and architectural characters. This paper focuses on looking for individual beauty of architecture among the commonality, highlighting the geographical features, showing the rich local cultures, and elaborating those unique human feelings. Architecture is an expression form of culture. Architectural appearance structure has a direct impact on the building art form in that all types of building structure appearances of different times and places reflect significant geographical features. China's architecture started at a late time but fast speed especially after the reform and opening up. Since then the soaring market economy and intensifying urban construction has provided an unprecedented opportunity for construction development. The collisions with foreign cultures and the impact of foreign diverse architectural styles has broadened our horizons and brought new ideas, which help us make remarkable achievements in terms of architectural innovation.

Several commuter rail, AMTRAK, and freight rail corridors may be used in the future to accommodate heavy, light and/or high-speed rail systems in the United States. Diesel/electric locomotives, which populate urban rail corridors, have heavy load requirements and are industrial and/or utilitarian in appearance. However, diesel multiple units (DMUs) with lighter weight, increased fuel efficiency, ease of accessibility, additional capacity, enhanced performance and lower costs are competing for their market share. Currently, monorails, people movers, and streetcars - along with the traditional light and heavy rail systems - have public acceptance to enrich the urban environments surrounding the existing corridors, and enhance commuter experience.

Although signs and maps have been the most common and effective solutions to orientation and wayfinding problems, wayfinding design is now concerned with more than just a function of providing directions. Many international metropolises have been influenced by globalization, with one possible outcome being that cities, especially those in developing countries, will become standardised and homogenised with their distinctive local features eroded by global values and dominant western culture. Effectively, this is leading to the standardisation of those cities' wayfinding systems (especially the graphical components of the wayfinding system, which this chapter is most concerned with). As capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing is recognized as the political, educational, economic and cultural centre of China. Changes are taking place rapidly in this ancient eastern city; On the one hand Beijing is hastily expanding its modernisation by building many steel-framed high-rise buildings and keeping in line with international aesthetic standards; On the other hand Beijing spares no effort to preserve its own traditional cultures and ethnic traits, to keep a link with the past, by means of renovating heritage sites and putting up pseudo-traditional architecture. Alongside the tremendous changes in Beijing, the roles and meanings of wayfinding systems have also changed, especially road signs and doorplates whose roles have been transformed from an initial household register to orientation reference, then onto the identification of a city. This chapter investigates and explains the cultural significance behind the wayfinding systems of Beijing, as well as the relationship between the local and the global reflected in the formation of this cultural significance. The chapter will achieve these aims by analysing and comparing various visual elements and different design principles between the present wayfinding systems of Beijing (urban road signs and doorplates) and the early wayfinding designs of Beijing, as well as decoding these different mainstream political or cultural ideologies that have greatly affected Beijing's wayfinding design in different periods. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Attracting tourism by drawing attention to local cultures, particularly through the consumption of culture-driven products, is a current trend in urban competitiveness. Cultural products translate messages, narrate memories and historical events, and establish an emotional connection with people. We explore their use as a city marketing strategy for the former Tainan State Magistrate Residence. These products can be integrated with other cultural zones to represent Tainan City. The Tainan City government registered the Residence as a city-level historical heritage site, and completed its restoration and reuse plan in 2000. However, no practical marketing strategy has been formulated to promote the site and raise cultural awareness among locals and tourists. We conduct an empirical case study involving a one-day cultural learning tour of the Residence with 61 student participants, who share experiences of rich identifiable cultural features that are transformed into unique and irreplaceable cultural product ideations. The findings provide a clear understanding of the dynamic relationship among cultural products, city heritage, and city marketing. Such a relationship strengthens the potential of cultural storytelling through the design of cultural products for city image promotion and urban regeneration. This relationship also enlightens designers, urban planners, and policy makers as to the importance of cultural communication through products. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Cultural product; Culture-driven product; Historic heritage; Storytelling marketing","Cultural product; Culture-driven product; Emotional connections; Empirical case studies; Historic heritage; Historical heritages; Marketing strategy; Urban competitiveness; Commerce; Communication; Competition; Economics; Marketing; Strategic planning; Product design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874997413

This paper challenges the assumption that arts-based interventions create a focus for public culture and thereby enhance a community's character and sense of well-being. It argues that the current enthusiasm for designled regeneration typically results in the introduction of new or expanded cultural ambitions to coastal communities, rather than reflecting and supporting existing cultures and ways of life. In providing elite cultural attractions new developments are often incompatible with local aspirations and identities. The research is based on the proposition that through the replication of everyday practices in specific locations a sense of identification or belonging emerges for the actors involved and the identity of a place becomes visible. A study of urban performativity was undertaken in the seaside town of Skegness in the UK utilising a range of data collection methods including participant observation, behaviour mapping and tracking. These techniques facilitate an understanding of how people interact with each other and with the built environment as they go about their everyday activities. The paper concludes that everyday performances are key determinants in shaping place identity and studies of urban performativity should be used to complement conventional urban analysis techniques for generating design initiatives in urban spaces. © Common Ground, Kathleen Watt, All Rights Reserved.","Place Identity; Urban Performativity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900463679

In truth, the critical element is not the subsystem itself but the successful integration of the two along with the other key system components from PDS (Power Distribution System) to fixed facilities to fare collection. Without particular attention and effort by owners and suppliers as to how the various components physically and functionally interact as a comprehensive system, the end result could range anywhere from significant project delays to unacceptable safety conditions. Growing trends in the transit industry are adding to the already existing complexity of system integration. These growing trends include changing requirements. Just as technical requirements are becoming more and more onerous, so too are commercial requirements; in particular, project schedule. Owner-required shortened project design-build lifecycles are resulting in less time to thoroughly account for all subsystem interfaces. Another aspect to be explored occurs in brown field applications when 21st century technology must replace (or even interact) with non-compatible, decades old equipment still in operation. Finally, as the economy becomes more and more global, so too does the APM/ATS industry. The ""one stop shops"" for APM/ATS systems are being replaced by multiple sub suppliers from various parts of the world. As a result, system integrators must ensure that all parties are ""speaking the same language"" in terms of commercial and technical terminology as well as business and ethnic culture. These changes have had a substantial impact on the integration efforts required on any given transit project. This paper will examine the pitfalls that accompany these growing trends as well as the methods and practices that can help avoid them. © 2913 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Automatic train control; Automation; Life cycle; Terminology; Urban transportation; Commercial requirements; Comprehensive system; Key system components; Power distribution system; System integration; System integrators; Technical requirement; Technical terminology; People movers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887322473

The main objectives of the KSELC are to assist people who wish to revitalise and develop their Khoekhoe language skills, and to create a teaching environment that will respect the Khoekhoe, but also the San's heritage and culture. Before the opening of the KSELC, research was conducted in terms of a pre-testing and post-testing research design. This was done through a survey of, first, Khoekhoe-related issues in Heidedal, such as identity, perceptions, attitudes, views and meanings, and second, the expectations of the role or influence the KSELC would have in the promotion of awareness in Khoekhoe and San matters. The data obtained during the survey are presented and interpreted in this article.Over the centuries, colonialism and apartheid have stripped the Khoekhoe of their culture, identity and language. The democratic dispensation that has been in effect since 1994 addresses this historical injustice, and affords constitutional accommodation and recognition to the Khoekhoe and the San. However, in most cases a recognised leadership is no longer in place, while knowledge concerning the Khoekhoe culture, identity and language is extremely limited. A whole new field has consequently opened up and much research, mainly amongst rural communities, was conducted. After all, 'real' Khoekhoe and San are 'supposed' to be located in rural territories, in the countryside, far away from cities. The value of the current study lies in the fact that it focuses on the dynamics, complexities and expressions of urban Khoekhoe revival. The urban context challenges our traditional understanding of the Khoekhoe and San - of the notion of a 'pure' and 'genuine' cultural identifier, as well as how identities may be formed, expressed and maintained. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","identities; Khoekhoe; language; perceptions; San",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871307966

Cultural landscapes illustrate a combination of man's persistent life and the art of land modification by means of natural environment and in the form of human settlements in the past ages. Currently, the human society's development in addition to the scientific progresses, man's increasing use of resources and negative consequences of tourism development without any correct design and optimal management in natural historical areas, has led to the destruction of ecological and historical structures of cultural landscapes. The new consideration of general environmental protection has been the context for protecting biological historical areas and settlements. Natural and historical region of Talesh with special ecological characteristics is one of the most valuable and attractive areas which has settlements of 4500 years old. One of the valuable parts of Talesh cultural landscape, especially in Agh-evlar Maryan studying region of Talesh countryside near Karganrood River, is the permanent and seasonal settlements of local nomads. These settlements with special architecture, methods of utilizing local materials, correct location and particularly various times of building, have specific persistent and attract many tourists. On the other hand, the development of new constructions and villa building of surrounding cities has led to the gradual destruction of cultural landscapes of the region. Identifying these settlements and the way of their being spread by means of new technology of telemetry has created the basis for the general environmental protection of their cultural characters. In addition, the presentation of rules for developing the new buildings to match with the cultural landscape leads to stable tourism development. Considering that cultural landscape is a combination of man, nature and history, we can conclude that all cultural landscapes have originated from nature or have been developed in nature and the continuance of their lives depends on the nature. Natural resources such as natural structure of the earth (geomorphology), groundwater structure (underground streams, springs, aqueducts) and surface water (rivers, lakes and seas), plantation structure (trees, bushes and covering plants specially the local ones), wild life, weather, climate and other natural factors make a dynamic background on which humankind changes, evolves and is permanently developing. Materials and Method: Taking the general purpose of the study into consideration and introducing the natural historical bed and Agh-evlar Maryan cultural landscape in terms of a cultural landscape, in the process of studies, an analysis of natural bed characteristics and the historical and archeological features of the monument and works scattered throughout the plains and along Karaganrood river valley, has been carried out. The criteria of analysis have been identified based on the modern definitions of cultural landscape in international conventions. Due to the variety of cultural landscapes in different countries, the presence of different natural bed variables, human and cultural resources and what has been left from ancient civilizations all over the world, the cultural landscape criteria have gradually got accomplished during several conventions. In this study, modern technologies like satellite data processing and image analysis have been applied, in addition to field studies and environmental interpretations, together with different scientific data such as geology, botany, hydrology, hydrogeology, Tectonic, etc. Study area: Special characteristics of Iran's geographical region and the variety of its ecological structure have created many cultural landscapes. One of these valuable cultural landscapes is located in the heights of Talesh, called Taleshan. This special geographical area is located along the western coasts of the Caspian Sea, from the north of Anzali Lagoon to Kura River's deltas and estuaries in Northern Talesh. Their western border separates from Ardabil with Talesh Mountains' ridge. The ethnic area of Talesh begins from Gilan's Rudbar and it elongates from Eastern Kapurchal Tamghan and Salian town to Shirvan (The Republic of Azerbaijan) encompassing the whole eastern latern of Northern Alborz - Talesh Mountains and its coastal plains. The most important water stream of the area is Karganrood River. Talesh area has three important points in term of geographical position, influencing the formation of its settlements: A. The foothills position and also the western mountains covered with forest, with the height of more than 10 thousand meters B. The crossing of Karganrood River - as the biggest river of Talesh - with a permanent stream of water and rocky bed, and also, the stream of Kalfarood which flows 6 kilometers down to the Southeast, and Navrood in the distance of 7 kilometers from the east C. The variety of area's climates, considering its location on the skirts of Talesh Mountains on one hand, and its location on the Caspian Sea coast, on the other hand. Actually it is located in two different types of mountainous climates with cold winters and mild summers in high yaylaki parts like Agh-Oular Maryan and damp and mild climate around the low coastal parts. Thus, the existing settlements in the area which were formed in the past centuries are created under the impacts of these conditions; in fact, they show a part of Taleshan's culture and civilization. Currently, the form and dispersion of villages, the decampment route and Nomads' seasonal encampment place have not changed since old times, although there have been the urbanization phenomenon which has led to the migration of villagers' and Nomads' to dispersed cities in coastal part. Identification and location of these settlements as a part of cultural landscapes is very important in general environmental protection of the area. Determining the geographical limits of these settlements is also significant in determining the border of cultural landscapes of natural and historical areas of Taleshan. Discussion and Conclusion: Although there is an ambiguity in the date of Talesh heights' inhabitation, it is known that the first human groups who got on these heights were the ranchers in search of fresh grasslands, who migrated from the west. Since the geographical condition did not let the ranchers stay the whole year in one range, they designed a nomadic society. Gilan Province consists of two parts that are coast-plain and foothill-mountain in the west and the east. In its western and southern parts which are mountainous, ranching is common. This activity has always been done in a nomadic way of go and return. Because of the intimate connections between plains and mountains on one hand, and the impossibility of continuous and permanent use of heights and their skirts on the other hand and also the optical utilization of them for the ranchers because of the availability of grassland and water resources and good climatic and seasonal conditions, these people has continued their nomadic style. Nowadays, in addition to the semi-nomadic ranchers, in warm season of the year, many villagers and urban population use mountainous settlement for their pastime, and enjoy the clean and sedative air of the heights. Considering the vastness of farming activity which limits the possibility of foddering the livestock because of the lack of pasturelands, and also the plain inhabitants' tendency toward heights as the first place of their settlement, the connection between plain and mountain is made through these two ways: A. The encampment of farmers, especially the rice-planters, which begins from the last days of Khordad. Their yaylaq is located in average heights (Mianband) and they return to their permanent settlement for rice harvest in the middle of Mordad. They often use the motorway for the one-day go-and-return. This kind of encampment from rural and urban points of the area is based on the habit of escaping from warm low lands, and it is also done for passing the free time and keeping a few big livestock. B. The encampment of ranchers in the form of semi-nomads and shepherds without doing any farm of activity which is done in qishlak, mianband and yaylak. The qishlaki area of the nomads is located in the west of the region until the beginning of the dense forests and in summer, qishlaki villages are evacuated from population, because the nomads encamp to the heights (mianband and yaylaq) and in winter the qishlaki villages get populous again as the nomads return. Conclusion: The variety of environment and human activities in this area has led to the birth of nomadic lifestyle. Although the first human groups in Talesh heights were looking for fresh grasslands, because of the particular geographical condition of the area, seasonal settlements have occurred. Also, the proficiency in ranching, natural conditions of the area, keeping and raising the livestock, rich pastures, escaping from the warm weather of low lands in summer and vice versa in winter have been the causes of persistence and survival of this phenomenon. In general, the causes of nomadism and semi-nomadism in Talesh can be the following: 1. The need of yaylaq and mianband for getting pastures for livestock in warm seasons. 2. Past record of settlement in heights and downward motion and having fields in yaylak and mianband. 3. Existence of rich pastures in mianband and yaylaq and the need for using them. 4. Proficiency in ranching and not having the knowledge of farming and gardening activities. 5. Climatic and natural environmental conditions. 6. The old tradition of encampment. 7. Using the clean climate of mountain often with ranching especially for rice-planting ranchers.","Agh evlar maryan; Cultural landscapes; Ecological structures; Integrated conservation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921781387

Since open and green spaces in urban areas often seem to lack direct economic values, expanding the manufacturing of precaution instruments in short term produces higher profits in local government investment. Thus, public sector will have to increase land uses in the short term economic interests, and financial support for the development of urban green spaces is less in comparison with other investments. This problem exists in both developed and developing countries, especially in city centers. However, in developing countries, due to urban management of short term economic interests, the presence of the problem is highlighted more. Obligations of developed countries to environmental agreements and the pressure of public opinion seem to have more conscious of environmental issues that have created an incentive to identify new solutions towards the development of urban green spaces. On the other hand, the private sector developers in the construction sector to reduce costs and gain more profit in making buildings, the percentage of which dedicated to green spaces in different ways is added to the whole infrastructure. This content in zones with high density class (both in terms of building and in terms of traffic volume) is featured in the construction of residential buildings with parks and green natural landscape in large scale with the rapid development of large cities seems impossible. Green roof is one of the new approaches to architecture and urban planning and sustainable development concepts that can increase per capita green space, improving environmental quality and sustainable urban development. The roof can be applied as a possible optimum utilization of land. Green roofs can improve urban air quality, reduce waste volume levels, reduce urban heat island effect, balance heat in internal and external environment, create natural habitats and biodiversity and increase operational life of the roof insulation, which is a positive step towards improving the quality of urban environment. Green roofs and vertical gardens can be traced back to the hanging gardens of Babylon and were known to exist in the Roman Empire, a response to population pressures in urban areas. In Pompeii shop-keepers grew vines on their upstairs balconies, and the ancient historian Pliny wrote about trees being imported for green roofs. The Romans also put trees on top of institutional buildings, such as the mausoleums of Augustus and Hadrian. The Vikings layered the walls and roofs of their homes with turf to protect against wind and rain, and sometimes used seaweed to insulate roofs. During the Renaissance, steeply terraced gardens and green roofs were common in the city of Genoa. Vertical gardens, in the form of hanging gardens also existed in pre- Columbian Mexico, India, and in some of the Spanish homes of 16th - 17th century Mexico. N Russia, hanging gardens were favored in the 17th century Kremlin, and in the 20th century, green roofs and hanging gardens grace homes in Tashkent, Tbilisi, and Dushanbe and even at the airport in St. Petersburg. Many contemporary designers owed their ideas to Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright who are the first modern defenders of the roof or balcony applied as a green space. Le Corbusier was the first person in the 21st century who applied green roofs; one of his five principles for introducing a modern building was green roof and roof garden. He also predicted that urban areas will have roads on which they have a roof of verticality. The natural outcome of Green roofs that was clearly the philosophy of American Primary Schools is to eliminate the growth of buildings and stresses in urban perspectives. In the early 60s AD, considering the context of environmental quality and urban environmental challenges, especially in the downtown areas of large cities, and city heat island phenomenon is the emergence reason of wave energy crisis, new approach to green roofs began in Northern Europe. In Iran, there is a long background of the architecture of brick and mud, moss and lichen cover and a variety of herbaceous plants on the roof, such as the construction of village houses roofs in Azerbaijan, Gilan and Mazandaran. Typical forms of these village houses are seen in Masouleh where lower roof courtyard houses are constructed. The use of green roofs in country elements is unknown and strange. Due to the high value of land in major Iranian cities, especially Tehran and consequently the vertical growth of the city, and less green space areas, according to international standards and inappropriate distribution in its neighborhood, the use of green roof technology on the roofs of large Iranian cities seems to be a good option. According to having 19 topics concerning energy saving benefits of green roofs in the National Building Regulations, green roofs can have policies in line with the national construction act. Also, the central government called the fourth development plan of Iran Green and had discussions to determine energy savings and create culture, environment, etc. It has been suggested to consider green roofs in metropolitan cities of the country for planning Green Government goals. Materials and Methods According to municipal green roof with various aspects of that interaction with one another, a method of analysis for such multi-purpose convention question seems appropriate, because this technique, the process of modeling a problem with different objectives, sometimes opposites in the form of hierarchy. This also allows us to quantify and qualify criteria to evaluate the issue we are looking for. Initiating with the study of experiences and resources in developing and improving the quality of green roofs and urban views of relevant professionals, green roof nonproliferation factors in various aspects of hardware and software experts determine the main aspects of non-green roof development in question. It was determined that six main themes are required for the development of green roofs. The subjects are classified according to their priorities. The existence of a gap in the development of green roofs was deliberate. First, a separate matrix for each of the axes was prepared. Thereafter, the comparison of the pairs in each matrix of every subgroup was addressed by experts. Priority rating for each axis using AHP software Expert Choice was carried out (in each priority, the classification rate of incompatibility with the AHP method was investigated). The first priority actions in each category strategy were marked. Subsequently, the synthesis (integration) and conclusions based on the ideal synthesis of performance and sensitivity analysis graphs depicting the sensitivity of the option to all objective criteria are shown as follows. To determine the main axis of green roof using various sources, the ideas of eight experts interested in the development of urban green spaces were considered. These experts include a landscape design faculty member and three Ph.D. students in urban planning and geography, three experts in the municipal urban green space and a M.Sc. in urban and regional planning. The main basis for designing the priority classification questionnaire and the convention of 102 people was the ideas of these environmental experts. In the classification of priority axes, the main priority in each subgroup was classified by the relevant matrix formation with the assistance of 30 experts. Results: Considering the multiple factors involved in the development of green roofs through the first study and the study of texts and documents related to the research topic and making use of expert opinions, overall assessment of the axes of green roof development in Iran was based on the six main factors for the development of green roofs.","Hierarchical analysis; Promotion of environmental quality; Urban ecosystems; Urban green roof","Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860127893

Constructing the new socialist countryside is an important historical task in the modernization process in China at present. While constructing the new socialist countryside, new tourism village draws more attention because of its good ecological and economical interests. However, the following common problems exist in the construction of many new tourism countryside: inadequate knowledge of advantages and disadvantages of the local resources, blind imitation of others, even direct and complete copy of tourism products of other villages, which result in singleton development pattern among neighboring areas, assimilating products, and unnecessary competition. While on the hand under the influence of globalization, designs of buildings, landscape and ecology are more and more similar in appearance to each other, which are gradually losing their local features....... The author thinks that while developing new tourism villages people should focus on the local peculiar natural and humanitarian resources, try to find different idea of development and construction from that of the neighboring villages, integrate tourism development with construction of new socialist countryside, make tourism development an opportunity to improve local ecology, and make tourism a sustainable income source for the villagers. The design of buildings, landscape and ecology in the new tourism villages should have no fixed patterns; it should differ according to different time, terrain, and people. Designers should, by taking account of the specific social background, and natural environment, produce different countermeasures accordingly in order to make customized plans for the area.

For landscape architects and urban designers this presents both the challenge of multiple 'sense of place'' and the opportunity to create a unique notion of 'intercultural places' that generate an environment that people of all cultures can have associative relationship with. This paper explores the notion of Cultural Literacy and the impacts of design decisions on the cultural life of Australia's diverse communities. Methods Cultural Literacy can be understood as the ability to read, understand, find significance, evaluate and compare local cultures. As Lefebvre [1996] states ""Cultural Literacy can be seen as the skill base associated with understanding both the encoding and decoding required to develop culturally meaningful products, places or programs"". The paper will present a cultural literacy framework for seeing, planning and designing through an intercultural lens. Results By understanding the communities multiple 'place narratives' and seeing things through an intercultural lens it is possible to plan and develop more inclusive and culturally sensitive public spaces. Conclusions As culture is what gives meaning to our lives then everything we do should have a cultural dimension. Therefore, all planning is or at least should be cultural, and be at the very centre of thinking about cities, not just about our social or civic life but also about the environment, infrastructure and economics of the city. The presenter will explore the potential of responsive planning and understanding the consequences and implications of urban planning on a community's cultural life and highlight a range of Cultural Literacy tools for planners and urban designers.",,"Architecture; Stream flow; Cultural dimensions; Design decisions; Diverse community; Encoding and decoding; Landscape architects; Planning and designings; Sense of place; Urban designers; Lenses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953791179

The abrasions of the River have made a new Levee, far within the old one, absolutely necessary. Obliterating entirely one of the beautiful and far-famed gardens. The shade lane, too, of lofty oleander which last year was covered at this time with a perfect waste of blossoms. The pleasant walk on the river bank arched over with China trees.2 The lovely alleys of Cape jessamines, and the white bell flowered Yucca, from which years ago I derived my first impressions of the exuberance of southern vegetation, all, all, have vanished and in their place nothing but a long, bald, earthy, embankment, a wind dusty road, immense piles of cord wood (for supplying the steamboats), with rail tracks in every direction to facilitate their transmission from point to point.3 Stagnant pools of muddy water between the old Levee and the new. In short, deformity for beauty, utility for poetry, but the grand river still redeems it all, and the fresh green woods on the distant bank, and the fresh pure air blowing across its restless current.4At first, this account appears to be little more than a description of a nineteenth-century open space in New Orleans-perhaps a public park- that had deteriorated significantly within a year, much to Wharton's dismay. Neither the space nor its description seems to be of much significance for American urban history. What Wharton wrote about here, however, was Carrollton Gardens, a hotel in a landscaped setting created at the terminus of the streetcar line in the 1830s as an attraction to encourage the public to ride the streetcar and enjoy the refreshment and outdoor experiences the garden offered.5 Such commercial spaces, together with similar examples elsewhere in the country, are unexplored opportunities to investigate how nineteenth-century Americans perceived and used open spaces.Carrollton Gardens, in operation between 1835 and 1891, falls midway in a continuum of similar commercial open spaces in New Orleans that offered food, outdoor recreation, or amusements, the earliest of which dates from 1810. Sifting through seemingly unremarkable artifacts of everyday life such as newspaper advertisements, periodical articles, photographic images, and even sheet music, we find numerous references to open spaces similar to Wharton's description. Known over time in nineteenth-century newspaper advertisements as ""pleasure gardens,"" ""pleasure grounds,"" ""houses and gardens of pleasure,"" and later as ""amusement parks,"" these commercial ventures were scattered throughout the community. Spatially, however, they were situated in an ill-defined middle ground between the public sphere and private property. Accessible to the public, albeit on the owners' terms, these enterprises offered attractions their owners thought the public would embrace.Early nineteenth-century pleasure gardens in America were versions of European examples from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By the end of the nineteenth century, they had evolved into amusement parks, typological precedents for the ""theme parks"" found throughout the world from the mid-twentieth century on.6 When one considers the wide variety of forms taken today by such amusement-oriented venues (not only theme parks but also waterparks, family entertainment centers, zoos, aquaria, ""exploratoria,"" science centers, resorts, and casinos), the millions of people who have patronized them, and the revenues they generate, the significance of pleasure gardens as key precedents in the general evolution of these designed landscapes becomes clear.7Substantial evidence, presented here for the first time, situates pleasure gardens in several major nineteenth-century American cities, and anecdotal evidence suggests examples may well have existed throughout America, in commnities large and small, coastal and inland. Investigations of these pleasure gardens have been initiated primarily by music and theater historians because such spaces, both in Europe (notably London) and later in America, primarily offered musical and theatrical entertainment; food, beverage, and leisure-related recreational activities were only of secondary importance. Pleasure gardens have been of marginal interest to landscape historians perhaps because the activities they offered are considered commonplace and therefore less worthy of study than more refined landscape expressions.8Five factors have contributed to the marginal treatment of pleasure gardens in conventional discussions of American open space. The first is the absence of visual evidence. Examples-even plans-for pleasure gardens that predate late nineteenth-century amusement parks are largely nonexistent, and what documentation exists from earlier examples is mainly narrative rather than illustrative, describing activities rather than spatial order or design. Second, designers of these spaces (if we can even speak of them being ""designed"") remain anonymous. Third, pleasure gardens were private developments, not municipal features on public property; as such, they resemble other commodities in that their commercial success (and therefore longevity) was determined by market forces and fickle public tastes. Fourth, what was popular one season was often shunned the next. The raison d'être of pleasure gardens was the regularly programmed ""entertainment"" (including food, drink, theater, and music) that usually occurred during favorable weather conditions. Similar attractions may have been present in public parks on an occasional basis but were usually of less importance than the year-round active recreation and passive activities for which public parks were designed. Finally, a continuum leading from early pleasure gardens to more recent amusement parks is not well established or widely acknowledged. Early examples have long since vanished, the prevailing secondary literature neglects them in favor of more prominent public parks, and later amusement parks generally do not figure significantly in contemporary discourse of public open spaces.9 As a consequence, pleasure gardens have gone largely unstudied and underappreciated as a landscape typology.Nevertheless, a closer examination is warranted for several reasons. Pleasure gardens precede other examples of designed open spaces in America, and they occur much earlier than those well-documented efforts, found from the mid-nineteenth century onward, to build public parks in urban areas. They are different, in both form and content, from open spaces of the ""rural cemetery"" movement, and their purposes are distinct from the lofty appreciations of the landscape encouraged by the transcendentalists, intellectuals, and landscape painters of the nineteenth century. Finally, these early examples of the designed landscape are part of the evolution of American concepts of landscape architecture, recreation, and open-space usage that would later find expression in public projects as the profession of landscape architecture evolved from its mid-nineteenth-century origins.Commercial pleasure gardens are one of at least five open-space models found in nineteenth-century New Orleans. As elsewhere, local pleasure gardens were commercial places of public amusement, eating and drinking, sport, and entertainment, precursors to later ""concert saloons,"" brothels, theme and amusement parks, and even private country clubs because of the activities they offered (including amusements, sports, eating, and drinking) and the policies in place regarding admission.10 The first notice of a pleasure garden appears in a newspaper advertisement from 1810 in a new residential area upriver from the colonial community; by the century's end, pleasure gardens had evolved into the suburban beer gardens, performance venues, and amusement parks of Spanish Fort and West End along the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, precedents for twentieth-century Pontchartrain Beach (for whites) and Lincoln Beach (for ""coloreds"").11 Until now, New Orleans pleasure gardens have been discussed briefly, first as performance venues within the context of the community's nineteenth-century musical history, and later as places where ""city people"" went in the ""expectation of pleasure.""12 Closer examination, however, reveals there is much more to learn here in terms of urban history.Of the American cities one might take as the focus for an analysis such as that proposed here, New Orleans stands out for several reasons. This community's pleasure gardens demonstrate how local conventions of race and gender influenced access to and uses of these recreational spaces. They show European cultural influences on open-space design and recreational activities in an American community, demonstrating the persistence of such foreign influences through the nineteenth century. They also reveal how technology and rising middle-class aspirations encouraged access to and use of these open spaces, enabling them to become commodities of consumption in the local marketplace. The number of pleasure gardens found in nineteenth-century New Orleans-around twenty have been identified throughout the larger community thus far-indicate their public popularity; their importance as recreation and entertainment venues; their geographical place in the urban fabric; and the cultural, social, and economic roles they played in public life. In addition, their nineteenth-century trajectory demonstrates how external factors related to race, economics, and cultural heritage influenced organization, use, and content of these privately owned open spaces. Finally, information about local pleasure gardens, seen as part of the larger context of open spaces in other nineteenthcentury American communities, adds significantly to a broader knowledge of the country's urban-landscape history.The map (Figure 6.1) gives general locations for pleasure gardens in nineteenth-century New Orleans. Though many have come to light, it is difficult to know exactly how many there were in nineteenth-century New Orleans. Information about their contents and activities is inconsistent, and it is impossible to ascertain if all venues using the words ""pleasure garden"" or ""garden"" actually described open spaces or characterized theatrical attractions, musical entertainment, leisure activities, or decorative motifs instead.Notably, the names of well-known European pleasure garden precedents occur locally in different locations and at different times, suggesting both knowledge among locals of European precedents and specific interest in using nominal associations as a means of attracting customers.14 Notices in the New Orleans Emporium occur in July 1832 for legal matters related to a Louisiana Vauxhall Gardens on Common Street; this may have been the predecessor to the New Vauxhall Garden, but no information exists as yet about its content or design. There were at least two New Orleans properties known as Tivoli: one is mentioned in 1808, location unknown; discussion on the other, found on the Carondelet Canal, follows.As elsewhere, the unifying factor among local pleasure gardens is their entrepreneurial nature. These private spaces were open to the public as business ventures, and their existence and longevity responded to market forces of capital, location, opportunity, and clientele. Entrepreneurial characteristics explain their often short life spans and differentiate pleasure gardens from other nineteenth-century public open-space models such as neighborhood squares, levees, and public parks. Available evidence among pleasure gardens may be inconsistent, yet useful information about them emerges in four general categories: Their administrative structures (admissions policies, conduct expected of patrons); the activities offered (sports, musical and theatrical events, spectacles); the accommodations provided (food and beverage); and their design (plant materials and structures). Pleasure gardens illustrate unique interpretations of public space in terms of organization, access, and content, and their characteristics demonstrate evolving local practices concerning consumption, leisure activities, social interaction, cultural influences, and open-space design, thereby giving new relevance to their importance in nineteenth-century urban life.Social attitudes in nineteenth-century New Orleans based in racial and cultural identity are just now being explored through lenses of politics, culture, and music, and the practices that resulted from these attitudes are complicated, complex, and confusing.15 Although legacies of these attitudes exist today, their impacts on publicly accessible spaces in nineteenthcentury New Orleans remain, until now, largely unexplored.

Good architecture and urban design contribute to making cities both functional and attractive to residents and visitors. While architecture is about the design of buildings, urban design is about the relationships between the buildings, the roads and spaces that they front, and the people who make use of them. The outstanding building projects are those that are not only visually stimulating, but are also sensitive and respectful of their surrounding developments and environment. A well-designed city takes into consideration this important relationship between buildings and the beauty of the city as a whole. Socialization is the process that prepares humans to function in social life. It should be re-iterated here that socialization is culturally relative - people in different cultures are socialized differently. The process of socializing or sociability in a city means acquiring the model of style life of that city. The process of socializing includes every daily activities of citizens' life. People have mutual relationship in this place and actualize it through presenting the municipal cultural and social activities and resolving the needs of each other. The municipal cultural and social realm has to develop the way of acquiring the necessary life skills gradually among the citizens.

Street vendors and the specter of street vending are embedded in an array of contending spatialized practices. Not only do they have to contend with the city's legalist anti-peddling ordinance but they must negotiate with its privileged status as a cosmopolitan city of refuge and as a confluence between highland indigenous and lowland cultures.

Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a postcolonial lens to offer a review and synthesis of issues of cultural identity of the Balti people of Pakistan. Findings The review demonstrates how the historical and socio-political context is intertwined with the Balti people's cultural identity which remains hybrid as well as contextual in its construction. It reveals that while the state of Pakistan has been able to assert its control over the Balti people and the region of Baltistan predominantly through military means, the critical issues of cultural pluralism and the basic human rights of the Balti people have remained generally ignored throughout the 63 years since partition. Research limitations/implications The contentions offered in this paper need to be refined through in-depth empirical studies. Future scholars may wish to examine the class and cultural politics at work in the emerging renaissance movement in Baltistan.

This phenomenon is followed by either destruction of old buildings or being changed to low class buildings such as warehouses, work places, etc. Settlement of poor and deprived people in these old city textures as well as inappropriate outer development policy of cities where aged and historic textures are found have made these places an arena of social problems which has decreased the quality of life and consequently exposed the historical values of the area under extreme damage. During the renovation and restoration implementation process especially that of inner city development, while we should keep efficiency, justice, environmental quality, security, hygienic, and beauty of city spaces in mind, identity and city life must be preserved and in order to reach a optimal city development, city environment and cultural heritage should be protected. In this approach, people's connection with the memory, history and identity of the place, beautiful sceneries, interesting and various adventures, individual's relation with present culture and other people, and historical values are factors which are at the service of enriching present city life and culture not just a museum attitude for preserving some old monuments. Reviving dying city places which carry people's memory of a certain period of time is done with the intention of preserving, restoring and developing them and in the designs proposed for them we should utilize those monuments which enjoy a certain identity that by highlighting them, they affect the structure of the whole city. As a place, these city areas are still enjoy many potentialities that with some planning and programming we can change them into revived and dynamic areas; an area that reminds us of the past and reflects the today's compassion and identity. For more compatibility, more profit, decreased environmental pollutants, and sustainable development, restoration and renovation process must be in compliance with the ecological structure of the region as well as the environmental resources. With the help of modern regional planning and less expenses in designing buildings, utilizing existing natural energies are possible. That is, cities need to be adapted to environmental situations, social and cultural structures if they want to survive. In developing these areas care should be given to the historical and structural dimensions; factors affecting texture, erosion and aging; factors increasing these worn-out places; considering different methods for dealing with these buildings; constructing inplace buildings using domestic and abroad experiences; exploiting all the necessary expertise; and economical, social, political, administrative and cultural factors.Utilizing capacities found in unused lands in these areas, as well as reviving structural identity of these places, lead to historical continuity, cultural consistency, national spirit, and preserving identity, memories, and socio-cultural values.

This paper argues that the fusion or the installation of culture as relevant entity in the framework of knowledge guiding the built environment is the key to the community's sustainability. The influence of culture will also reflect on the untapped knowledge and potentials that can be generated in a whole body of effort made by the people to survive in housing related crisis.

While a new economy develops around finance, design and cultural institutions growing in city centres, many people are forced to change their settlement areas.

Our interpretation of this goal led to a web-based collaboration between students taking courses in geography at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UHM) on a comparative study of the Chinatowns in Singapore and Honolulu. Students in both locations posted information on ""their"" Chinatown, including statements of personal experience, photographs and other graphic images, as well as quotations from interviews with residents. They discussed these with counterparts, and then worked in groups on a comparative analysis of the two locations. Critical comparative work provides an opportunity to move beyond traditional area studies approaches in that it consciously investigates similarities and differences across places rather than beginning from a starting point of single, autonomous locations. ""Chinatowns,"" for example, are a common part of the urban landscape throughout the Asia Pacific region; they are immediately recognizable as such and will inevitably be read as symptomatic of the presence of Chinese culture. Nevertheless they are created and are preserved under particular conditions, and while Chinatowns in both Singapore and Honolulu, for example, functioned historically as Chinese ethnic enclaves, the former exists within what is now a predominantly Chinese society and has been largely ""beautified"" to become an important tourist destination, while the latter continues to accommodate minority immigrants, albeit now predominantly Southeast Asian, maintaining its traditional role as a site of everyday commercial and interpersonal interaction, but remaining largely ""run down"" as it resists government efforts at gentrification. One of the aims of the project was to think about the problems and possibilities involved in comparison. In the new language of post-area studies, the interaction was designed to move beyond ""trait"" geographies in area studies frameworks-or geographies that emphasize foundational elements- toward ""process""-oriented geographies that connect diverse areas in new ways. The distinction is nicely made in a paper produced for the Ford Foundation's Crossing Borders initiative, and since it is no longer available online, we quote it here at length (Appadurai et al. 1997, cited in Olds 2001,129; see also Morris-Suzuki 2000): Much traditional thinking on ""areas"" has been driven by conceptions of geographical, civilizational and cultural coherence which rely on some sort of trait list of values, of languages, of material practices, of ecological adaptations, of marriage patterns and the like. However sophisticated these approaches, they all tend to see ""areas"" as relatively immobile aggregates of traits, with more or less durable historical boundaries and with a unity composed of more or less enduring properties. . . . In contrast, we have begun to explore an architecture for area studies which is based on process geographies, and sees significant areas of human organization as precipitates of various kinds of action, interaction and motion, trade, travel, pilgrimage, warfare, proselytization, colonization, exile and the like. These geographies are necessarily large-scale, changing and tend to highlight variable congeries of language, history and material life. Put more simply, the large regions which dominate our current maps for area studies are not permanent geographical facts. They are problematic heuristic devices for the study of global geographic and cultural processes. Regions, in our approach, are taken to be initial contexts for themes which generate variable geographies, rather than as fixed geographies marked by set themes. Our Chinatown project was conceived to help students to move beyond ""trait"" geographies that see Chinatowns as material manifestations of culture, and toward thinking about how these landscapes are shaped by ""processes"" such as migration, racial ideologies, and tourism. This is not simply to replace cultural essentialization with the new universalizing framework of globalization, however, for even if exoticism and urban development combine to (re) make ethnic enclaves into objects of tourist consumption throughout Asia Pacific, a detailed comparison of Singapore and Honolulu Chinatowns shows that processes operate unevenly and combine contingently and that they are experienced and represented in very different ways. Our project was structured to lead students toward a ""processual"" understanding of the respective Chinatowns, and for the most part we believe we were successful. Nevertheless, at times, interactions were hampered by traditional ""trait"" thinking as some of our students confused Chinatown and ""Chineseness"" and mobilized stereotypes of Singaporean and Hawaiian cultural identities. In fact, at one point there was a clear breakdown in our collaboration, which we suggest was at least partly due to several unforeseen factors: first, since the vast majority of NUS students identified as Chinese and only a small minority of UHM students had any Chinese ancestry or exposure to Chinese culture, participants on the two sides generally had differential investments and assumed authorities in the topic at hand; second, as a consequence of the increasing pressure of deadlines, tensions developed between participants operating in different academic cultures, who were nevertheless equally dependent upon each other's timely ""virtual"" cooperation; and third, as pressures of time mounted and perhaps as mutual trust developed among participants in the web-based discussions, communications generally became more ingenuous, and some took offense, responding with public recrimination or partial withdrawal from the collaboration. Having set up the collaboration carefully and seen it develop in the right direction, the instructors were caught off-guard by this turn of events, and we found ourselves desperately trying to help students think more ""processually"" about the others of our collaboration. Remarkably, despite the climate of mutual suspicion, some students were able to use the critical tools of cultural analysis we had promoted in our respective classes, but given more time and prior sensitivity to this problem, we might have helped other students avoid the trap of ""trait"" thinking and the sense of disappointment that they carried away from the collaboration. Our collaboration raised difficult issues about how we represent and engage with different people and places, and it was a serious challenge for all involved. We remain optimistic that web-based interaction can provide a valuable context for the mutual exchange of ideas and questioning of beliefs that are taken for granted (Rich, Robinson, and Bednarz 2000, 266), but we have become more sensitive to its limits and aware of the need for prior sensitization of participants and careful monitoring by instructors. In other words, if ""virtual fieldwork . . . can allow students to carry theoretical concepts into confrontations with empirical representations"" (Warf, Vincent, and Purcell 1999, 147), it can also allow students to carry stereotypical conceptions into confrontations with virtual others. We suggest that this is particularly likely where participants have differential investment in the object of collaboration, where time and other pressures are intense and unequal, and where educational cultures are most different. In the following, we recount the design of the project, reflect on some of these difficulties, and discuss the lessons for the project of remaking area studies pedagogies. © 2010 by University of Hawai'i Press.

This paper represents an extension of work in relation to a graduate level design studio recently taught at Georgia Tech with the aim of presenting more complex definitions and uses of ecology in architectural practice as a complement to the science behind the environment. Ultimately, the ideas and strategies described here hold potential for new forms of relationship between people, place, material and earth. The paper is organized into two parts. The first part identifies three major concerns: 1) the current predicament of peak global oil production; 2) the re-occurring problems associated with the mind-set separation of culture and nature; and 3) the untapped potential between ecology, creativity, and architecture. The second part places these concerns in practice, in the context of three green housing proposals located at Hulsey Yards, a 35-acre in-town, industrial urban site south of downtown Atlanta that is strategically placed along the Belt Line Atlanta Project, a 22-mile inner-city light rail loop and greenway currently the focus of a multi-million dollar study by the Georgia Department of Transportation [3]. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.",,"Architectural design; Ecology; Engineering education; Gravitation; Solar energy; Thermodynamics; Architectural education; Environmental design; Environmental science; Green technologies; Scientific principles; Environmental management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029116410

The challenge is to design development that is compact and sustainable, yet environmentally compatible despite our predominant car culture. The root of the problem lies in the space required by automobiles, which results in paved environments relatively devoid of landscaping - a significant drawback for residential development, which is pivotal to the to the use of public transit. Advanced transit engineering solutions alone are not enough to induce the public to choose more compact development for residential purposes. Solutions can be found in various forms of traffic restraints. These may be made more restrictive for higher densities, if accompanied by appropriate transit systems. In the case of new development, APM shuttles and loops, with their capabilities of short headways and around-the-clock operation, are ideal tools for creating urban infill with compact, auto-free, and landscaped communities. While in most areas of the U.S., the centrifugal momentum of urban sprawl continues to trump initiatives aimed at more compact development, it is a gross simplification to assume that sprawl is the inevitable outcome of technological progress, free choice and the free market. Notwithstanding the powerful, sprawl-inducing incentive of land speculation in outlying areas, wherein profits are often measured by a factor of five (RERC, 1974,) sprawl would have never occurred in its present and growing dimensions without massive government and corporate-sponsored investments and subsidies that have encouraged private motoring, and a tax code in which an anti-urban bias has played a central role. The past and present influence of these investments and subsidies, and the potential for shifting our future financial support toward new priorities, cannot be dismissed in any discussion of the subject. The ""Iron Law of Urban Decay"" is a creation of political choice and not of nature. The most effective tool we could employ for curbing urban sprawl would be a shift of government investments in urban infrastructure, away from highways and toward a variety of forms of public transit networks. If moratoria were placed on the construction of new highways and utility infrastructure on the urban fringe, sprawl would quickly begin to loose its momentum. This would need to be followed by changes in those zoning laws that currently literally force strip-commercial and large-lot-residential development. But these would be political, and not just planning design decisions, for land speculation, particularly in concert with new transportation access, has long been one of the most lucrative and politically protected enterprises of the powerful.

The case of the glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum is used to illustrate this process. When the pyramid was planned, the citizens themselves participated in a heated discussion on its construction. Now, more than a decade later, the pyramid is considered an emblem of the museum. By analysis of the controversy over the pyramid, we can consider how contemporary French society initially interpreted and eventually accepted a new artifact in the landscape of Paris. During the initial controversy, and also after construction, some critics called the project a mark of the despotism of the man who initiated the Louvre remodeling project, President François Mitterrand. However, it does not clarify the important questions about this controversy: which concept of the landscape of Paris conflicted with the glass pyramid, and how was the new building accepted nevertheless? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes the arguments about the symbolism and the harmony of the new landscape that were raised in the controversy. The arguments about the symbolism concerned the urban space of Paris and the shape of the pyramid. The spatial centrality of the Louvre in Paris was seriously considered. Under that condition, the interpretation of the ""Egyptian"" shape of the pyramid was always negative. It reflected a prejudiced, exclusionary frame of mind advocating a heterogeneous culture. The arguments about the harmony of the landscape concerned the Louvre and the material of the pyramid. The Louvre was interpreted as a ""palace."" It paradoxically suggested that the Louvre has played important roles in the history of modern France. The interpretation of the material of the pyramid emphasized its ""transparence."" It led to discrétion, meaning an absolute respect for the history that the Louvre had witnessed. This analysis allows us to consider the origin of the controversy. The Louvre was regarded as a symbol of the Republic, because of its history in the liberation during the Revolution. The Louvre Museum itself has functioned as a representation of French culture, in terms of collecting worldwide art works, interpreting them, and exhibiting them in the order which is required in French society. The glass pyramid was planned not only in the historical place, but also in the mythic place of the establishment of France. Accordingly, the origin of the dispute appears to be whether the new building intruded on ""French culture."" How was the new landscape accepted after that? To deny the interpretation of ""something foreign,"" the people who consented to the construction cited historical facts that justified the pyramid. The opponents of the project countered by quoting historical facts in their own arguments. As a consequence, the glass pyramid was linked to many reference points in French culture. In the background of the acceptance of a new landscape in Paris, there was an acquisition of cultural legitimacy.","Acceptance of a landscape; Controversy over the Louvre pyramid; References to French culture; Symbolism and harmony of landscape","landscape; museum; public attitude; urban design; France; Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142027686

Bird patterned his scheme after Stein and Wright's Radburn garden-city fragment, but the uniquely evolved character of Wildwood Park owes as much to regional landscape, geomorphology, and local post-war culture as it owes to its famed antecedent. As a unique and idiosyncratic community design, Wildwood Park merits attention and further study by planning historians and those interested in alternative neighbourhood forms as social constructions or cultural landscapes. In addition, it suggests many things to designers of contemporary communities, many of whom are currently looking to traditional pre-World-War-II grid-pattern neighbourhood structure and aesthetics as inspiration for (presumably) more socially cohesive neighbourhoods. Whether such designers are inclined toward the garden-city precept for separation of automobiles and pedestrians, or toward this contradictory ""new urbanist"" premise that cars and people should cohabitate within community open space, Wild-wood Park has much to offer as precedent. Both its pedestrians-only park and its highly interactive lanes that do mix people and cars-and particularly these two complementary landscapes considered as a ""matched set"" -offer many interesting design lessons in matters of two-dimensional platting, three-dimensional neighbourhood structure and four-dimensional considerations for structural and landscape transformations that occur over the span of several decades.",,"greenspace; historical geography; landscape; twentieth century; urban history; Canada; Manitoba; Winnipeg",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035706852

Box 9475, Berkeley, CA 94709, United States","The supplement accompanying this issue of The Ecologist (subscription and ordered copies only) aims to make clear how public policy and taxpayers' dollars have given shape to and maintain today's corporate-dominated global economy, and how they have systematically undermined smaller-scale, more democratic modes of economic organisation around the world. The current global architecture favours gigantism on many levels: from the borderless worldwide trading arena itself to the huge transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominate it: from mammoth monocultural agribusinesses to the urban metropolises in which concentrated populations increasingly consume the same mass-produced goods, entertainment and news reports, and respond to the same globally-transmitted advertising messages. The systemic support given to this model stands in sharp contrast to the steady subversion of a more vernacular architecture - one comprising a diversity of economies which are smaller in scale, more decentralised and more dependent on local resources. As Small is Beautiful: Big is Subsidised points out, the design of the global economy depends in part upon international agreements like the GATT and NAFTA, and on such supranational bodies as the World Bank, the IMF, and the World Trade Organisation. But there is far more to the architecture of globalisation. Transport infrastructures to facilitate long-distance trade are needed, as are communications networks to homogenise people and cultures worldwide, and to enable TNCs to monitor and co-ordinate their global enterprises. Educational infrastructures are required to prepare children in every culture for their future roles as consumers, producers and corporate managers, and to implant in them the technophiliac worldviews of industrialism. Research infrastructures are needed to provide industry with continual innovations to raise productivity, keep consumption high and draw ever more resources from the planet. Regulatory bodies are required to limit the damage caused by corporate excess and to assuage public uneasiness about the pace of technological change. A military infrastructure is needed to keep the less stable elements of the architecture in place. These support systems are not paid for by the large enterprises that stand to benefit from them, but by ordinary taxpayers. So too are the costs of environmental and social breakdown, which follow the industrial model everywhere it is imposed. Small is Beautiful: BIG is Subsidised highlights examples of the way larger scale is promoted by public policy in every corner of the world, from the most industrialised economies to the least. In so doing, it not only disproves the notion that the trend towards ever-larger scale is inevitable, but shows that it is within our hands to move in a quite different direction.",,"global economy; globalization; international trade",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032440709

Seminar participants, challenged with balancing both people and engineering factors, propose establishing a science station featuring modular neighborhoods of three 10-person groups sited under a radiation shielding dome in a near-side crater with Earth views. Central to the crater-based neighborhood design is an architectural and engineering philiosophy that incorporates creating familiar sights, sounds, and a shirt-sleeve lifestyle to enrich the crews' lunar experience as missions in astronomy, extravehicular research, geology, and pre-Mars base habitation are conducted. The neighborhood concept is essential in achieving the multiple goals of safe, cost effective, and rewarding exploration, while maintaining healthy and creative social and cultural interactions among multi-national and skill-diverse crews. Spaces for bathing, recreation, crew-arrival celebrations, and problem solving are desired while the introduction of a new culture to the Moon occurs concurrently with human adaptation to a foreign environment. ""Neighborhooding"" features regular events - such as meals, seminars, and a gathering place for descision-making - as required rituals. To address population spread, architectural eco-care considerations were viewed as critical. Engineering and construction objectives comprise eco-considerations to protect the lunar environment through techniques that maximize in-situ vitrification and dust mitigation building technologies, as well as air-, heat-, water-, plant-, and waste-matter recycling. Power needs are met by a combination of solar arrays and a stand-alone, inherently safe nuclear unit. Additional out-of-crater electrical needs, primarily for science experiments, are met via radio isotopic thermoelectric generator technology. Station access for crew rotations and resupply is available via a nearby landing site, and such events are celebrated. Emerging areas of concern remain, however, as this academic program, now in its second year, applies terrestrial, architectural and engineering principles and experience as an analog to the lunar environment. This one-of-its-kind seminar program is performed under the auspices of the University's School of Architecture and Planning. Active involvement of astronauts, architects, engineers, scientists, and space pioneers from U.S. industry, the national laboratory system, NASA, and academia has proven invaluable to this applied academic program. Students from ten countries attended, with significant Pacific Rim participation. Academic disciplines ranging from engineering to philosophy were represented, as were multi-national and multi-gender perspectives, and that of the physically challenged. The program's test-case application could serve as a template for future courses, encouraging a multi-disciplinary approach to science projects.

The question of how to implement family planning in minority areas if of utmost importance. In February 1982, the State Council decreed that family planning policy for minority groups could justifiably be more lax than for the Han people, who comprise a majority of Chinese population. Instead of advocating 1 child per couple, as is the current national policy, urban minority groups are permitted 2 (with exceptions, 3) children per couple and rural villagers are permitted 3 (with exceptions, 4) children. The 1982 National Census showed that the natural rate of growth for Xinjiang was 13.63/1000 (compared to the national rate of 11.45/1000) with individual minority growth rates as high as 20.11/1000. The area's gross output value cannot keep up with this population increase. Over half of Xinjiang's minorities are of the Islamic faith, which teaches that births are not self-willed. It is crucial to inculcate in them that births can indeed be planned. Also, their custom of early marriage (age 15 for girls and 16 for boys) which leads to a high fertility rate, must be changed. Although Xinjiang's land mass is great, only 38.4% is arable, so the common belief that its population can grow without limit is fallacious. When family planning was being implemented nationwide, for minorities it was only propagandistic. After the population growth for the majority Han was under control, the minority groups declared family planning programs would also benefit them. Symposiums were held contraceptive use became voluntary among many women. The birth rate fell from 22.5/1000 in 1981 to 14.09/1000 in 1985. Family planning also received approval from religious leaders. But because population distribution and growth are uneven in Xinjiang, family planning policy must reflect these differences.",,"article; Asia; birth control; birth rate; China; Contraceptive Usage; cultural anthropology; Cultural Background; Demographic Factors; demography; developing country; Eastern Asia; ethnic group; Far East; Fertility Measurements; measurement; methodology; Natural Increase; policy; Political Factors; politics; population; population and population related phenomena; population dynamics; population growth; Population Policy; sexual behavior; Asia; Birth Rate; China; Contraceptive Usage; Cultural Background; Demographic Factors; Developing Countries; Eastern Asia; Ethnic Groups; Family Planning Policy; Fertility Measurements; Measurement; Natural Increase; Policy; Political Factors; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Population Policy; Reproductive Behavior; Social Policy; Asia; Birth Rate; China; Contraception Behavior; Culture; Demography; Developing Countries; English Abstract; Ethnic Groups; Family Planning Policy; Far East; Politics; Population; Population Characteristics; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Public Policy; Research Design; Sex Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0023165861

Nearly 30% of Peru's entire population and 42% of its urban population live in Lima. The trend continues, yet Lima's urban primacy is waning due to the growth of some regional centers like Trujillo and Chimbote. Lima is still almost 10 times as large as the country's next ranking cities, Trujillo on the northern coast and Arequipa in the south. Peru's main administrative divisions are the 24 departments, of which the Department of Lima is one. These departments are further divided into 156 provinces. Greater Lima consists of 2 such provinces, the province of Lima and the constitutional province of Callao. Although the population of Lima continues to grow, its rate of growth slowed from about 5.5% during the 1960s to about 3.9% in the 1970s. Current projections estimate a metropolitan population of 6.7 million by 1990. On the whole, Lima's age structure is somewhat older than that of the rest of Peru. The median age of the population is 22.3 years, compared to a national figure of 20.4. The proportion of persons over age 65 is only 3.6%, lower than the national average of 4.1%, due to the tendency of in-migration to concentrate people of intermediate ages in the cities. Almost 400,000 inhabitants of greater Lima are bilingual in Spanish and an indigenous language. As elsewhere in Peru, the dominant religion is Roman Catholicism. Lima is a spread out city with few high rise buildings due to the danger of earthquakes. Only 12% of Lima's households are found in apartment buildings. As in other cities of Latin America, the formal housing market is beyond the reach of a major segment of the population. Consequently, much of the urban settlement has occurred through informal self-help construction. Only 2.7% of the metropolitan population over age 15 is illiterate, down from 5.4% in 1972 and 7.7% in 1961. In 1981 Lima had 93 hospitals with a total of 12,640 beds.
