2,Friction: An ethnography of global connection,"A wheel turns because of its encounter with the surface of the road; spinning in the air it goes nowhere. Rubbing two sticks together produces heat and light; one stick alone is just a stick. In both cases, it is friction that produces movement, action, effect. Challenging the widespread view that globalization invariably signifies a ""clash"" of cultures, anthropologist Anna Tsing here develops friction in its place as a metaphor for the diverse and conflicting social interactions that make up our contemporary world. She focuses on one particular ""zone of awkward engagement""--the rainforests of Indonesia--where in the 1980s and the 1990s capitalist interests increasingly reshaped the landscape not so much through corporate design as through awkward chains of legal and illegal entrepreneurs that wrested the land from previous claimants, creating resources for distant markets. In response, environmental movements arose to defend the rainforests and the communities of people who live in them. Not confined to a village, a province, or a nation, the social drama of the Indonesian rainforest includes local and national environmentalists, international science, North American investors, advocates for Brazilian rubber tappers, UN funding agencies, mountaineers, village elders, and urban students, among others--all combining in unpredictable, messy misunderstandings, but misunderstandings that sometimes work out. © 2005 by Princeton University Press.

158,"Visual pollution: Advertising, signage and environmental quality","In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the problems that public spaces face because of the design of commercial signs. The negative consequences that commercial signs can have on the visual quality of urban areas and further more, on people's quality of life, has been studied from both architectural, planning and psychological perspectives. While the issue of visual pollution, as this phenomenon is commonly described, has been widely debated, there is as yet no clear conclusion as to how best to control commercial signage and whether different urban contexts and people from different backgrounds and cultures have universal or distinct preferences. Several different commenrcial signage approaches are currently applied to different historic cities, but these initiatives are not based on principles derived from the perception and evaluation of users. Drawing on a range of comparative and contrasting empirical studies of historic city centres in the UK and Brazil, this book examines questions of commercial signage control management, the preservation of historic heritage and user preference and satisfaction. The author takes an environment behaviour approach to this research, involving theories, concepts and methodologies related to environmental psychology, architecture, planning and urban design. In doing so, it argues that there are in fact visual preferences common to the majority of people, independent of their urban context and that these common views can be useful to the development of a general theory of how to control commercial signage. In conclusion, the book suggests that the best way of controlling signage is not only to recommend general guidelines related to the operation of commercial signage, but also to recommend design principles that can create commercial streetscapes evaluated positively by different users. © 2014 adriana Portella.

214,Belief systems in faith-based human service programs,"Using a grounded theory design and methods, 65 key informants in 15 faith-based organizations having promising programs in four urban areas were interviewed. Respondents were asked what makes their direct service programs faith-based. A story emerges, motivated by mission-driven visions tied to forces beyond local programs and steeped in deep traditions. A major implication of the findings is that in teaching people about the various practices of diverse religious groups, we are only giving them the visible elements. While the expressed values of acts and faith are integral in the faith-based discussion, they do not tell the full story. The deep drivers of human behavior and practice are found in the specific beliefs and interpretations of individuals who are involved either as leaders or participants in faith-based organizations. for many of these individuals in faith-based organizations, mission and accountability to God trumps secular or professional expectations. © 2006 by The Haworth Press.

375,Industrial Heritage: The past in the future of the city,"The concept of cultural heritage has clearly meant different things to different groups of scholars and the public interested in reclaiming traditions and cultural landscapes. Changes associated with urban growth often involve the destruction of built characteristics and natural elements, eradicating the physical expression of former indigenous ways of life that are a very important part of people's culture. This fact was particularly evident after the Second World War, when industrial landscapes faced deep transformations that in several cases contributed to its dereliction and to the disappearance of numerous industrial values, commonly known as industrial heritage. This phenomenon added to the necessity of reusing abandoned industrial landscapes in detriment of consuming new ones, increases the need to enlarge the interpretation of the term ""cultural heritage"", to analyse and interpret the value and significance of post-industrial landscapes and to develop new mechanisms to preserve it. Furthermore, it is increasingly acknowledged that the values connected with culture and heritage are highly significant for people's lives and need to be identified and highlighted. This paper presents a set of design principles that will be applied to the post-industrial landscape of left margin to the Arade River. These principles describe in a general manner the ways in which relevant resources created and deposited by the industrial society can be enhanced and how they can best be reclaimed and used."
583,Risk-based pipeline integrity management systems: A case study from Colombia,"Historical data indicates that gas pipelines are a safe means of transportation, but to maintain these safety records, it is necessary to do more than just routine operation, inspection, and maintenance activities. What is required in present day? In short, it is a must to develop a corporate and organizational culture that includes in its scope continuous risk evaluation and mitigation within a 'PIMS' (Pipeline Integrity Management System). A problem, common to all operators, is pipe aging: pipelines around the world are old and many are in poor condition. But in the case scenario for many countries in Latin America these old pipelines are within urban expansion areas and are surrounded by many more people and buildings that were expected at the original design stage. This is why operators must make additional efforts to rectify such situations: conventional maintenance activities are not enough to guarantee pipeline integrity and public safety. This paper presents how a Colombian pipeline operator has developed a PIMS based on semi-quantitative and quantitative risk assessment that has allowed focus on mitigation activities in most critical segments and has also allowed for design of customized action plans for each segment, to give more efficient risk control. © 2011 by NACE International."
