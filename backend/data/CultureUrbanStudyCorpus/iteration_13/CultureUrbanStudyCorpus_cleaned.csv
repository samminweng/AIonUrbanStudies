18,90.0,2012,Article,Defining Suburbs,"There is no consensus as to what exactly constitutes a suburb. This article examines the range of suburban definitions in terms of their structure and the topical issues that they grapple with. Suburbs have been defined according to many different dimensions from location and transportation modes to culture and physical appearance. Given this confusion, one approach is to abandon the term; another is to use it with greater precision. This is more than just an issue of semantics. Rather how people talk and think about suburbs shapes how they can see such areas being developed and redeveloped in the future. © The Author(s) 2012.",design; housing; land use; planning history; planning practice; urban design; urban form,Forsyth A.,10.1177/0885412212448101
19,85.0,2001,Article,Ethnic minority groups and the design of public open scape: An inclusive landscape?,"People from ethnic minority groups have a range of experiences of living in Britain, some of which are significantly different from those of white British people. Previous research and case studies suggest that the physical environment has a positive or negative role in perceptions of everyday life. It is argued that landscapes have a symbolic dimension, and aspects of landscapes can be recognized as familiar or alien, welcoming or excluding. A wide variety of case studies in Britain are used to discuss design and management practices that reflect a range of cultural experiences. The need for landscape architects and managers to be aware of how places may be interpreted in different ways by different ethnic minority groups, and to work towards inclusive design, is highlighted.",Culture; Design; Ethnic minorities; Perception; Urban parks,Rishbeth C.,10.1080/01426390120090148
73,19.0,2004,Article,Toronto and Vancouver bound: The location choice of new Canadian immigrants,"Ethnic clustering plays an important role in the location choice of new immigrants to Canada. A concentration of people in the same geographic area who are of similar ethnic background, culture and language can be an important source of financial and personal support, information and guidance, and social mores. Evidence is found that, after controlling for a range of other observable and unobservable factors important to the location decision, the concentration of people of a particular ethnic group in a particular area has a significant effect on the chance that new immigrants of the same ethnic group will choose to live there. The size of the effect, however, depends on the personal characteristics of immigrants. The attraction of ethnic concentrations of immigrants is significantly smaller for new immigrants with a university degree and for those who normally speak English at home. Characteristics of the local ethnic community related to education and language profiles are also significant determinants of location choice. © 2004 by the Institute of Urban Studies All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Immigrants; Mobility; Neighborhood effects,McDonald J.T.,
334,,2016,Conference Paper,The Formation of the Urban Environment in the West Siberian Oil and Gas Region: Problems and Challenges,"The article deals with the problems faced by the person in relation to the culture of creating a sustainable urban environment. The urban environment is seen as space of human existence, influencing its spiritual and physical health. All the experts involved in the urban environment, think about the culture of its formation, unfortunately, only from a departmental point of view. Differently organized human environment inevitably affects behavior, emotional state of a man, his perception and understanding of space. The cultural heritage of society fits in the space of an artificial environment created by a man, and determines the behavior of people.For the solution of problems of formation of the urban environment, it is necessary to apply a set of interrelated technical, social, environmental, aesthetic and other measures. In this capacity, landscape design as a set of methods has to build a sustainable urban environment to ensure harmonious living.Current trends, methods, and techniques of landscape design are to create sustainable environment for a person - creative, spiritual, comfortable, attractive, safe, harmonious. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bauer N.V., Speranskaya N.I., Shabatura L.N., Iatsevich O.E.",10.1088/1757-899X/154/1/012029
