4,303.0,1999,Article,Typhoid fever in children aged less than 5 years,"Background. Calculation of the incidence of typhoid fever during preschool years is important to define the optimum age of immunisation and the choice of vaccines for public-health programmes in developing countries. Hospital-based studies have suggested that children younger than 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever, but this view needs to be re-examined in community-based longitudinal studies. We undertook a prospective follow-up study of residents of a low-income urban area of Delhi, India, with active surveillance for case detection. Methods. A baseline census was undertaken in 1995. Between Nov 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 1996, we visited 8172 residents of 1820 households in Kalkaji, Delhi, twice weekly to detect febrile cases. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings. 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases were detected. Of these, 28 (44%) were in children aged under 5 years. The incidence rate of typhoid per 1000 person-years was 27.3 at age under 5 years, 11.7 at 5-19 years, and 1.1 between 19 and 40 years. The difference in the incidence of typhoid fever between those under 5 years and those aged 5-19 years (15.6 per 1000 person-years [95% CI 4.7-26.5]), and those aged 19-40 years (26.2 [16.0-36.3]) was significant (p < 0.001 far both). The difference between the incidence of typhoid at 5-19 years and the incidence at 19-40 years was also significant (10.6 [6.3-14.8], p < 0 001). Morbidity in those under 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and need for hospital admission. Interpretation. Our findings challenge the common view that typhoid fever is a disorder of school-age children and of adults. Typhoid is a common and significant cause of morbidity between 1 and 5 years of age. The optimum age of typhoid immunisation and the choice of vaccines needs to be reassessed.This study was conducted to measure the incidence of typhoid fever among preschoolers. It was suggested that children aged 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever. However, it is important to re-examine this view, particularly in infants and young children in the low-income urban area of Delhi, India, through active surveillance. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings revealed 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases, about 44% of which were in children under 5 years of age. Morbidity in children under age 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and the need for hospital admission. The incidence of typhoid fever and the age distribution of the case varied between developing countries. Thus, the age patterns of typhoid fever observed in the urban study area may differ in rural areas within India or in other developing countries. A reevaluation of the optimum age and vaccine of choice is needed.",,"Sinha A., Sazawal S., Kumar R., Sood S., Reddaiah V.P., Singh B., Rao M., Naficy A., Clemens J.D., Bhan M.K.",10.1016/S0140-6736(98)09001-1
5,216.0,2016,Article,Ten questions on the soundscapes of the built environment,"Soundscape research represents a paradigm shift from noise control policies towards a new multidisciplinary approach as it involves not only physical measurements but also the cooperation of humanity and social sciences to account for the diversity of soundscapes across countries and cultures, with more focus on how people actually experience the acoustic environments; and it considers environmental sounds as a 'resource' rather than a 'waste'. The ten questions presented in this paper range from the very basic definitions underlying the emerging soundscape science, to more applied topics about how to use soundscape as a design approach for the planning and management of the built environments. Although significant research activity has been conducted so far, there is still a need to systematically provide the underpinning science and practical guidance in soundscaping. Thus, the last question aims to identify the most crucial gaps in soundscape research and set the agenda for future advancements in the field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Acoustic environment; Environmental noise; Quality of life; Soundscape; Urban sound planning,"Kang J., Aletta F., Gjestland T.T., Brown L.A., Botteldooren D., Schulte-Fortkamp B., Lercher P., van Kamp I., Genuit K., Fiebig A., Bento Coelho J.L., Maffei L., Lavia L.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.08.011
6,191.0,2005,Article,The transnational capitalist class and contemporary architecture in globalizing cities,"The focus of this article is on the role of the transnational capitalist class (TCC) in and around architecture in the production and marketing of iconic buildings and spaces, in global or world cities. The TCC is conceptualized in terms of four fractions: (1) Those who own and/or and control the major transnational corporations and their local affiliates (corporate fraction). In architecture these are the major architectural, architecture-engineering and architecture-developer-real estate firms. In comparison with the major global consumer goods, energy and financial corporations the revenues of the biggest firms in the architecture industry are quite small. However, their importance for the built environment and their cultural importance, especially in cities, far outweighs their relative lack of financial and corporate muscle. (2) Globalizing politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction). These are the politicians and bureaucrats at all levels of administrative power and responsibility who actually decide what gets built where, and how changes to the built environment are regulated. (3) Globalizing professionals (technical fraction). The members of this fraction range from the leading technicians centrally involved in the structural features of new building to those responsible for the education of students and the public in architecture. (4) Merchants and media (consumerist fraction). These are the people who are responsible for the marketing of architecture in all its manifestations. (There is obviously some overlap between the membership of these fractions.). My conclusion is that many global and aspiring global cities have looked to iconic architecture as a prime strategy of urban intervention, often in the context of rehabilitation of depressed areas. The attempt to identify the agents most responsible for this transformation, namely the TCC, and to explain how they operate, suggests that deliberately iconic architecture is becoming a global phenomenon, specifically a central urban manifestation of the culture-ideology of consumerism. © Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.",,Sklair L.,10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00601.x
9,125.0,2002,Article,Good looking: In defense of scenic landscape aesthetics,"Among US writers on environmental aesthetics, it has become de rigueur to leverage Aldo Leopold's legacy against the proliferation of ""popular"" landscape tastes, which are typically seen to have their origins in 17th-19th century European traditions of landscape painting and aesthetics. These writers regard victims of popular or ""scenic"" landscape tastes (exemplified by Olmsted's Central Park) as intellectually shallow, motivated by momentary ""sensory pleasures"", and passively and anthropocentrically drawn to ""naturalistic"" environments rather than actively and biocentrically engaged with natural environments. This implicit refusal to grant sensory information and affective processing the power to catalyze and inform serious reflection is not new; neither is the attribution of popular landscape aesthetics to the elite society of a limited culture and historical period surprising, given the current preponderance of post-modernist sensibilities. However, in the often highly-charged atmosphere of local environmental planning and management arenas, both positions are needlessly polemical. More importantly, there is good evidence to suggest that both positions are founded on misconceptions about how the human mind works. In this paper, we will review work that establishes the intellectual bona fides of visual imagery, the important contributions that emotions make to cognition, and the likelihood that explanations of environmental aesthetics rooted in European enlightenment-era landscape painting are inadequate. This review suggests that frequent calls for new normative environmental aesthetics based on a cognitive understanding of ecological sustainability are likely premature. As social scientists, we suggest that attempts to impose prescribed environmental aesthetics (albeit ecologically pure environmental aesthetics) are inappropriate and may well be self-defeating. Instead, we suggest that a thorough understanding of visual and non-visual environmental aesthetics is needed, including examinations of the possibility that affect elicited by scenic encounters with preferred landscapes can lead people to form emotional attachments to the land and thereby develop a greater appreciation for sustainability goals. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

10,111.0,2006,Article,"Place, culture, and the social amplification of risk","This article investigates the role of culture in the social production of risks and risk communication surrounding industrial development in a region located at a rural-urban interface. A case study examined a public consultation that was undertaken to inform local residents about an eco-industrial development proposal being planned near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The research employed the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) to examine the relationships among culture, place, and socially constructed risk. A total of 44 in-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 33 landowners (farmers, acreage owners), public officials (municipal politicians, administrators), journalists, and industry representatives. Analysis revealed that risk communication occurred in relation to situated experiences of place that were based on conflicting cultural worldviews. The research shows that place is a useful component of the SARF, providing a spatial explanation for why some people amplify, and others attenuate, risks in locally contentious environmental debates. © 2006 Society for Risk Analysis.",Culture; Geography; Place; Social amplification of risk,"Masuda J.R., Garvin T.",10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00749.x
11,110.0,2009,Article,Making friends in Zurich's urban forests and parks: The role of public green space for social inclusion of youths from different cultures,"Integrating the distinct cultures of foreign resident youths is a challenge for Swiss political and educational institutions. An empirical survey of pupils (n = 437) and teachers in selected schools of the city and metropolitan area of Zurich investigated leisure activities in urban forests and public green spaces for their potential to facilitate social interaction between Swiss and immigrant young people. Patterns of socialising and making friends in these outdoor locations were found to differ depending on age, school level, gender and the percentage of immigrants in each residential area. Public urban green spaces were found to play an important role for children and youths in making contacts and friends across cultures, which is considered a prerequisite for social inclusion. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

12,110.0,2003,Article,Visions of nature and landscape type preferences: An exploration in The Netherlands,"A survey was carried out among inhabitants of Gennep, a small-town municipality in the east of The Netherlands, questioning about (1) the types of nature that people distinguish and the levels of naturalness ascribed to these types of nature; (2) the images that people hold of the appropriate relationship between people and nature and the level of adherence to these images, and (3) people's preference of broadly defined landscape types. Types of nature inferred by means of factor analysis were labeled arcadian, wild and penetrative nature, the last category comprising elements such as mosquitoes and rats in the barn. Factor analysis was used as well to infer images of appropriate relationship, which appeared to hinge around the concepts of mastery over nature, responsibility for nature and participation in nature, respectively. Levels of adherence to the responsibility and participation images were very high, indicative of a 'new biophilia' mainstream in Dutch culture. Landscape types were defined, roughly, as (1) landscape made by and for people; (2) park-like, arcadian landscape; (3) wild, interactive landscape and (4) landscape ""in which one may experience the greatness and forces of nature"". Strikingly, more than half of the respondents expressed preference for this last ('deep ecology') landscape type, with another third preferring the wild, interactive landscape. The highest preference of the 'greatness and forces' landscape was found among the respondents with high ascription of naturalness to the penetrative type of nature and respondents adhering to the participation-in-nature image of relationship. Preferences for landscape types as defined here should be distinguished from visual or behavioral landscape preferences. Even if people may not select landscapes of the 'greatness and forces of nature' in daily behaviors, these landscapes of wilderness and greatness do connect with human visions and desires. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

16,98.0,2013,Article,"Evaluating the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating various outdoor urban environments in the hot dry city of Damascus, Syria","Consideration of urban microclimate and thermal comfort is an absolute neccessity in urban development, and a set of guidelines for every type of climate must be elaborated. However, to develop guidelines, thermal comfort ranges need to be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating different thermal environments in Damascus during summer and winter. A second aim was to define the lower and upper limits of the thermal comfort range for some of these indices. The study was based on comprehensive micrometeorological measurements combined with questionnaires. It was found that the thermal conditions of different outdoor environments vary considerably. In general, Old Damascus, with its deep canyons, is more comfortable in summer than modern Damascus where there is a lack of shade. Conversely, residential areas and parks in modern Damascus are more comfortable in winter due to more solar access. The neutral temperatures of both the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and the outdoor standard effective temperature (OUT_SET*) were found to be lower in summer than in winter. At 80 % acceptability, the study defined the lower comfort limit in winter to 21.0 °C and the upper limit in summer to 31.3 °C for PET. For OUT_SET*, the corresponding lower and upper limits were 27.6 °C and 31.3 °C respectively. OUT_SET* showed a better correlation with the thermal sensation votes than PET. The study also highlighted the influence of culture and traditions on people's clothing as well as the influence of air conditioning on physical adaptation. © 2012 ISB.",Damascus; Microclimate; Thermal comfort; Thermal indices; Thermal sensation; Urban design,"Yahia M.W., Johansson E.",10.1007/s00484-012-0589-8
17,93.0,2010,Article,"Revanchist sanitisation or coercive care? The use of enforcement to combat begging, street drinking and rough sleeping in England","This paper examines recent responses to 'problematic street culture' in England, where increasing pressure has been exerted to prevent people from begging and street drinking in public spaces, with rough sleeping also targeted in some areas. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with enforcement agents, support providers and targeted individuals, it assesses the extent to which the strategies employed are indicative of a 'revanchist expulsion' of the deviant Other and/or an expression of 'coercive care' for the vulnerable Other. It concludes that, whilst the recent developments appear, at first glance, to be symptomatic of revanchist sanitisation of public space, closer examination reveals that the situation is actually much more complex than a revanchist reading of the situation might suggest, and perhaps not as devoid of compassion. © 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.",,"Johnsen S., Fitzpatrick S.",10.1177/0042098009356128

Singapore has undergone rapid urbanization after its independence in 1965, with a concomitant decline in natural habitat extent and accessibility. Using coastal mangrove forests as a case study habitat, changing cultural values were explored with a novel array of techniques, including qualitative archival analysis (photographs, oral histories), current sources (publically uploaded social media photographs), and surveys of (a) the general public and (b) visitors to publically accessible mangroves. Cultural value changed through time, with a significant transition from intrinsic, intrapersonal values (spiritual, cultural heritage) to instrumental, interpersonal values (recreation, education). Additionally, cultural value varied between different mangroves depending on their public accessibility, and the evolving degree of human interaction with the ecosystem as urban development occured. Cultural values change as development transitions, though mangroves still play an important cultural role in a heavily urbanized environment. © 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",Coastal; Ecosystem services; Mangrove; Recreation; Singapore; Urbanization,"Thiagarajah J., Wong S.K.M., Richards D.R., Friess D.A.",10.1007/s13280-015-0647-7
23,66.0,2017,Book,Urban sustainability transitions,"The world’s population is currently undergoing a significant transition towards urbanisation, with the UN expecting that 70% of people globally will live in cities by 2050. Urbanisation has multiple political, cultural, environmental and economic dimensions that profoundly influence social development and innovation. This fundamental long-term transformation will involve the realignment of urban society’s technologies and infrastructures, culture and lifestyles, as well as governance and institutional frameworks. Such structural systemic realignments can be referred to as urban sustainability transitions: fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent societal challenges are addressed, such as shifts towards urban farming, renewable decentralised energy systems, and social economies. This book provides new insights into how sustainability transitions unfold in different types of cities across the world and explores possible strategies for governing urban transitions, emphasising the co-evolution of material and institutional transformations in socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. With case studies of mega-cities such as Seoul, Tokyo, New York and Adelaide, medium-sized cities such as Copenhagen, Cape Town and Portland, and nonmetropolitan cities such as Freiburg, Ghent and Brighton, the book provides an opportunity to reflect upon the comparability and transferability of theoretical/conceptual constructs and governance approaches across geographical contexts.

25,63.0,2015,Article,"Autonomous adaptation to global environmental change in peri-urban settlements: Evidence of a growing culture of innovation and revitalisation in Mathare Valley Slums, Nairobi","The growth of peri-urban areas is increasingly recognised as a dominant planning and urban design challenge for the 21st century. In burgeoning poor urban settlements growing on city margins, autonomous adaptation strategies are often the only measures to respond to increasing climatic and compounding stressors. Yet, in both research and practice there remains lack of understanding regarding the dynamics of adaptation and risk reduction at the level of the community. In this paper, we argue urban slums are ideal places to consider adaptation because they offer examples of more extreme social-ecological stress than one finds in more established communities - the kind we can anticipate more broadly in the face of climate change. A framework for identifying local adaptation processes is presented and applied to analyse the case of Mathare Valley Slums in Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated suburb, where residents are regularly exposed to flooding from heavy rainfall. Findings reveal that slums, often viewed as illegitimate, makeshift, and temporary settlements, are places experienced by many residents as permanent communities characterised by rapid environmental change. Processes of adaptation in Mathare have become institutionalised through time, as a new generation of people imagine themselves staying and (re)organise to achieve a higher level of functioning through various strategies to reduce risk. Innovative and revitalising adaptation occurs as residents shift from employing more generic and expected coping strategies, such as evacuating homes or economic diversification, to creating ""gated"" communities and savings schemes to maintain and improve the settlement, despite uncertain tenure. Both formal and informal institutions, such as youth groups, play an important role in governing such heterogeneous localities, incrementally upgrading the slum and providing critical public services. Long-term residents' increasing recognition of the permanence of the slum community and its stressful conditions appears to lead to more collective action toward adaptation pathways. However, this is in marked contrast to the dominant non-local perspective of Mathare's status as both impermanent and illegal, which prevails among government officials. As such, strategies are generally not incorporated into planned interventions. While progressive policies designed to reduce risk exist, they remain nascent in their establishment and fail to benefit slumdwellers. The case illustrates the need to incorporate the wealth of knowledge, techniques, and experience extant at the community level in the development of adaptation planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Autonomous adaptation; Climate change; Flooding; Mathare valley slums; Urban slums; Urbanisation,"Thorn J., Thornton T.F., Helfgott A.",10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.12.009
26,60.0,1994,Article,Reading landscape meanings: State constructions and lived experiences in Singapore's Chinatown,"The term 'landscape"" embodies multiple levels of meaning: it articulates the ideological intent of the powerful who plan or shape the landscape in particular ways and at the same time reflects the everyday meanings implicit in the daily routines of ordinary people associated with the landscape. Through an analysis of four themes constituting the landscape of Singapore's Chinatown, we unpack two different but interdependent versions of landscape reality: the construction of social meanings from the state's perspective and those derived from the lived experiences of Chinatown's inhabitants. In our first theme, we explore the multiplicity of meanings invested in Chinatown's housing landscape. For the state, urban renewal and public housing schemes in Chinatown represent the redrawing of landscapes along modernist lines informed by efficiency and rationality of land use, in tandem with the larger goals of nation-building. Among residents, however, the vision of modern living in everyday life was only a reality for a few; others experience the landscape in more contradictory ways. Second, in the landscape of community building, we show that state-initiated efforts at inculcating a sense of community have replaced the old spontaneous, interpersonal ties and the strength of organised vernacular associations. Inadvertently, these state strategies have in some ways actually been damaging and deleterious to community ties. In our third theme, we show how the state has, to a large extent, successfully rewritten the socially and physically polluted landscapes of Chinatown. Yet, there are examples of resistances where the state's vision of an unpolluted landscape has been punctured. Since the mid-1980s, a fourth imperative has emerged in the state's management of the Chinatown landscape in the form of attempts to conserve the landscape as a ""historic district"", a repository of the nation's tradition, history and culture. We show that there are different interpretations of the state's effort to revitalise Chinese culture in the conserved landscape and its attempt to cast Chinatown in the role of a ""common bond place"" for all Singaporeans. Singapore's Chinatown is thus a multicoded landscape inscribed with a multiplicity of meanings. It is neither used entirely as an ideological tool for manipulative ends nor does it fully embody the authenticity of daily experiences. © 1994.",,"Yeoh B.S.A., Kong L.",10.1016/0197-3975(94)90015-9

In particular, we consider how positive and negative images of young people's mobility play out in terms of the inter-generational frictions and negotiations generated by their mobility performances. We also reflect on the developmental implications, in terms of young people's access to services and income and their participation in the social networks and peer culture which may shape their life trajectories.

29,52.0,2011,Book,Greater Portland: Urban life and landscape in the Pacific Northwest,"It has been called one of the nation’s most livable regions, ranked among the best managed cities in America, hailed as a top spot to work, and favored as a great place to do business, enjoy the arts, pursue outdoor recreation, and make one’s home. Indeed, years of cooperative urban planning between developers and those interested in ecology and habitability have transformed Portland from a provincial western city into an exemplary American metropolis. Its thriving downtown, its strong neighborhoods, and its pioneering efforts at local management have brought a steady procession of journalists, scholars, and civic leaders to investigate the “Portland style” that values dialogue and consensus, treats politics as a civic duty, and assumes that it is possible to work toward public good. Probing behind the press clippings, acclaimed urban historian Carl Abbott examines the character of contemporary Portland-its people, politics, and public life-and the region’s history and geography in order to discover how Portland has achieved its reputation as one of the most progressive and livable cities in the United States and to determine whether typical pressures of urban growth are pushing Portland back toward the national norm. In Greater Portland, Abbott argues that the city cannot be understood without reference to its place. Its rivers, hills, and broader regional setting have shaped the economy and the cityscape. Portlanders are Oregonians, Northwesteners, Cascadians; they value their city as much for where it is as for what it is, and this powerful sense of place nurtures a distinctive civic culture. Tracing the ways in which Portlanders have talked and thought about their city, Abbott reveals the tensions between their diverse visions of the future and plans for development. Most citizens of Portland desire a balance between continuity and change, one that supports urban progress but actively monitors its effects on the region’s expansive green space and on the community’s culture. This strong civic participation in city planning and politics is what gives greater Portland its unique character, a positive setting for class integration, neighborhood revitalization, and civic values. The result, Abbott confirms, is a region whose unique initiatives remain a model of American urban planning. © 2001 University of Pennsylvania Press. All rights reserved.",,Abbott C.,

Improvement of microclimatic conditions in urban spaces can enable people to spend more time outdoors, with the potential to influence the social cohesion of a space and increase economic activity. The wider aim of this research is to develop a better understanding of the complex relationship between the microclimate and human behaviour in open public spaces in hot arid climates. Case studies are selected in two different parts of the world (Marrakech in North Africa and Phoenix, Arizona in the US) to represent a variety of users in a similar climatic context. This enables the authors to study the effects of socio-economic and cultural diversity on thermal comfort, behaviour and use of space. Field surveys include structured interviews with a standard questionnaire and observations of human activities, along with microclimatic monitoring, carried out during the summers and winters of 2008 and 2009. The analysis consists of: microclimatic influence on thermal sensation, preference and people attendance; effect of psychological adaptation on the subjective thermal evaluation of outdoor spaces; and investigation of socio-economic and socio-cultural impact on the behaviour of people in outdoor spaces. © 2010 Earthscan.",Hot climate; Microclimate; Outdoor thermal comfort; Socio-culture; Urban design,"Aljawabra F., Nikolopoulou M.",10.3763/inbi.2010.0046
31,48.0,2011,Article,Reclaiming the city: Waterfront development in Singapore,"In its quest to be a world city, many of Singapore's urban spaces have been subjected to constant redevelopment. Derelict waterfronts and ageing neighbourhoods have been given new life, enjoying their reincarnation as landscapes of economy and leisure. A prevalent theme in Singapore's transformation has been the reclamation of landscapes to cater to new users, activities and agendas. Adopting a case study of the Singapore River waterfront, this paper analyses three forms of urban reclamation. They include reclaiming functionality, aimed at infusing the waterfront with new land uses; reclaiming access, as a way of opening up the landscape to more people; and reclaiming the local, as a way to commemorate local cultures and histories. While government planners and private enterprise are intent on developing a world-class environment, Singaporeans and visitors respond to this urban vision in different ways with some praising the dynamism of worldly transformations and others criticising them as a prelude to a soulless city. While some degree of worldliness is essential in any redevelopment, a fine balance has to be sought between the excesses of global urbanism and the parochialism of vernacular concerns. © 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.",,"Chang T.C., Huang S.",10.1177/0042098010382677

35,41.0,2016,Book,Bike lanes are white lanes: Bicycle advocacy and urban planning,"The number of bicyclists is increasing in the United States, especially among the working class and people of color. In contrast to the demographics of bicyclists in the United States, advocacy for bicycling has focused mainly on the interests of white upwardly mobile bicyclists, leading to neighborhood conflicts and accusations of racist planning. In Bike Lanes Are White Lanes, scholar Melody L. Hoffmann argues that the bicycle has varied cultural meaning as a ""rolling signifier."" That is, the bicycle’s meaning changes in different spaces, with different people, and in different cultures. The rolling signification of the bicycle contributes to building community, influences gentrifying urban planning, and upholds systemic race and class barriers. In this study of three prominent U.S. cities-Milwaukee, Portland, and Minneapolis-Hoffmann examines how the burgeoning popularity of urban bicycling is trailed by systemic issues of racism, classism, and displacement. From a pro-cycling perspective, Bike Lanes Are White Lanes highlights many problematic aspects of urban bicycling culture and its advocacy as well as positive examples of people trying earnestly to bring their community together through bicycling. © 2016 by the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.",,Hoffmann M.L.,
36,40.0,2018,Article,Assessing the sustainability of Spanish cities considering environmental and socio-economic indicators,"The conception of urban metabolism has considered the perspective of environmental sustainability in the framework of cities. In this context, cities can be regarded complex entities driven by material and energy flows that entail consumption of resources and production of waste materials in the pursuit of economic welfare and social progress. According to a sustainability perspective, environmental, social and economic indicators must also be integrated into urban planning processes. However, methodological advances regarding the definition and development of sustainable cities are required since a consensus of indicators, weighting and data management is still lacking. In this paper, a multi-criteria approach that combines three methodologies: Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed and applied to a sample of 26 representative Spanish cities with different characteristics (i.e., population, location, demands, economy, topography and culture). The combined approach allows identifying the non-sustainable cities considering an offset of indicators from the three pillars of sustainability. With this purpose, the mentioned items are implemented in a DEA model of efficiency, being the inefficient cities with an efficiency score lower than 100% defined as non-sustainable ones. Finally, this multi-criteria method allows setting the target values for the assessed indicators (benchmarked values), which become objectives for the non-sustainable cities to evolve toward a more sustainable performance. The outcomes from the analysis have identified six cities that ranked worse, with efficiency scores ranging from 57.9% to 85.8%. According to the targets of socio-economic indicators, attention should be paid to AROPE rate (people at risk of poverty and social exclusion), unemployment rate and number of crimes, meanwhile lower levels of electricity consumption, municipal solid waste and on-site greenhouse gases emissions are desirable from an environmental perspective. These outcomes are of potential interest for politicians, governments and inhabitants to aid in the identification of the metabolic flows and social/economic indicators to be optimized in search of sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Data envelopment analysis; Life cycle assessment; Material flow analysis; Multi-criteria tool; Urban metabolism,"Gonzalez-Garcia S., Manteiga R., Moreira M.T., Feijoo G.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.056
37,39.0,2020,Article,Development and implementation of Mobility-as-a-Service – A qualitative study of barriers and enabling factors,"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has been argued as part of the solution to prevalent transport problems. However, progress from pilots to large-scale implementation has hitherto been slow. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to empirically and in-depth investigate how, and to what extent, different factors affect the development and implementation of MaaS. A framework was developed, with a basis in institutional theory and the postulation that formal as well informal factors on different analytical levels (macro, meso and micro) must be considered. The research was organised as a multiple case study in Finland and Sweden and a qualitative approach was chosen for data collection and analysis. A number of factors with a claimed impact on the development and implementation of MaaS was revealed. At the macro level, these factors included legislation concerning transport, innovation and public administration, and the presence (or not) of a shared vision for MaaS. At the meso level, (the lack of) appropriate business models, cultures of collaboration, and assumed roles and responsibilities within the MaaS ecosystem were identified as significant factors. At the micro level, people's attitudes and habits were recognised as important factors to be considered. However, how the ‘S’ in MaaS fits (or not) the transport needs of the individual/household appears to play a more important role in adoption or rejection of MaaS than what has often been acknowledged in previous papers on MaaS. The findings presented in this paper provide several implications for public and private sector actors. Law-making authorities can facilitate MaaS developments by adjusting relevant regulations and policies such as transport-related subsidies, taxation policies and the definition of public transport. Regional and local authorities could additionally contribute to creating conducive conditions for MaaS by, for example, planning urban designs and transport infrastructures to support service-based travelling. Moreover, private actors have key roles to play in future MaaS developments, as both public and private transport services are needed if MaaS is to become a viable alternative to privately owned cars. Thus, the advance of MaaS business models that benefit all involved actors is vital for the prosperity of the emerging MaaS ecosystem. © 2019 The Authors",Barriers; Enablers; Formal institutions; Informal institutions; MaaS; Mobility-as-a-Service,"Karlsson I.C.M., Mukhtar-Landgren D., Smith G., Koglin T., Kronsell A., Lund E., Sarasini S., Sochor J.",10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.028
38,38.0,2015,Article,"Slum upgrading and inclusive municipal governance in Harare, Zimbabwe: New perspectives for the urban poor","The story of the urban poor in Harare and Zimbabwean cities in general is a story of evictions, fear and misery. In May 2005, at the behest of the Government of Zimbabwe the infamous Operation Restore Order, a house demolition campaign left more than 700 thousand people homeless. Nearly a decade later, there are increased opportunities for improvement and change in the lives of the urban poor in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital city. The purpose of the paper is to present how the Harare Slum Upgrading Programme is creating and strengthening municipal and community partnerships to tackle city challenges in an inclusive manner. This research indicates the housing struggles of the urban poor and the emerging City-community engagement in urban services provision (water, sanitation, tenure security and roads) and changing municipal attitudes towards the urban poor. In particular, the article presents participatory urban planning and development, slum upgrading institutional structure, profiling and enumeration, and slum upgrading impacts (resilience of the urban poor, living in slums without fear, expansive pool of beneficiaries, review of planning regulations and land ownership) as major issues promoting inclusive municipal governance. Inclusivity is implemented through incremental development, which is allowing people to settle on land first and access municipal services gradually over time. Two main factors explain such positive steps towards inclusive governance in Harare. First are indications of gradual institutional change in which the City of Harare's governance culture is changing through 'opening up' and embracing the urban poor. Second, over the years, the urban poor have built a strong and vibrant alliance which is acting as a medium of participation in City governance. The paper concludes that slum upgrading sustainability at city-wide level requires active City participation and institutionalisation as opposed to a project based approach. Lastly, addressing concerns of the urban poor is susceptible to political contestations, requiring strong impartiality to counter such forces. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Citizen participation; Gradual institutional change; Harare; Housing; Inclusive municipal governance; Slum upgrading; Urban poor; Urban services; Zimbabwe,Muchadenyika D.,10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.03.003

Removing standard kerbs, barriers, highway signs and road markings forces motorists to use eye contact with other road users and pedestrians, for which they need to be travelling at less than around 30 km/h.

44,32.0,2004,Article,On the waterfront: Globalization and urbanization in singapore,"Although many cities aspire to ""global-city status,"" few have been as explicit as Singapore in its quest to create urban landscapes to project its global aspirations. This paper presents the case of the Singapore River development zone as a ""hyper-symbol"" of Singapore's global urbanism. By creating a world-class riverfront not unlike the acclaimed waterfronts of London, Sydney, or San Francisco, Singapore's urban planners hope to project the city as a venue worthy of world-class tourism and leisure activities, an important node in international circuits of capital, and a vibrant city for both foreign visitors and local residents. Our paper, however, also argues that local forces and influences play a significant role in the waterfront's development. The Singapore River landscape is the negotiated outcome of both globalism and localism—a dialectical landscape formed by dominant global influences on the one hand, and emerging local processes on the other. Fieldwork comprising a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews, and on-site observations provide evidence of such global-local interactions. The paper contends that the challenges at the river are symptomatic of the broader Singapore experience as the city-state grapples with issues of national identity, local empowerment, and community rights in the midst of a global convergence of tourists, capital, people, and cultures. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Chang T.C., Huang S., Savage V.R.",10.2747/0272-3638.25.5.413

Understanding the Latino urban experience and developing plans to better respond to both the needs of Latino communities and their integration within society is not only relevant, but also urgently necessary. Using the city of Los Angeles as a main lens, in addition to a general look at the urban Southwest, we contribute to the scholarship on the subject with a review of literature on Latino communities. We structure the review as an assessment of the various challenges and opportunities for urban Latinos in the pre-war, postwar, and contemporary city. Focusing on space, culture, economy, and governance, we chart the various roles both the private and public sectors play in meeting these challenges. Our reading of the literature shows that particular government actions in the economic and governance domains in the past had positive impacts on Latino integration, and we call for a similar effort today in addressing contemporary challenges. We conclude by suggesting that future planning scholarship on Latino communities engage the wider urban studies literature, focus on emerging forms of urbanization, and call on planners to sustain increased academic and practical interest in the topic. © 2008 Sage Publications.",Culture; Economy; Governance; Latino communities; Los Angeles (LA); Southwest; Space,"Irazabal C., Farhat R.",10.1177/0885412207310146
47,28.0,2002,Article,Comparison of community response to road traffic noise in Japan and Sweden - Part I: Outline of surveys and dose-response relationships,"To investigate cross-cultural differences in the community response to road traffic noise, social surveys were conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Kumamoto and Sapporo, Japan, using the same questionnaire and noise measurement method. Typical residential areas with detached houses and apartments were selected as the target areas in each city. The questionnaire comprised 40 questions relating to environmental, housing and personal factors. The key questions concerned annoyance caused by road traffic noise. The total numbers of respondents were 1142 in Gothenburg, 837 in Kumamoto and 780 in Sapporo. The response rates were 68.8, 69.3 and 57.5% respectively. After the questionnaires were completed, noise measurements were made in each area. Community responses were compared on the basis of the dose-response relationships. There were no systematic differences between community responses in Sapporo and Kumamoto, which have the same culture. People living in detached houses in Gothenburg were more annoyed by the same road traffic noise than the people living in Japanese cities. There were no systematic differences among the three cities with regard to activity disturbances indoors, but significant disturbance of activities and resting in gardens or on balconies was noted in Gothenburg. The difference in activity disturbance was due to the differences between lifestyles in the two countries. People living in detached houses were more annoyed by the house vibration caused by road traffic than those living in apartments and people were annoyed by the exhaust from road traffic to the same extent as noise.",,"Sato T., Yano T., Björkman M., Rylander R.",10.1006/jsvi.2001.3892
49,27.0,1998,Article,Intellectual of empire: Eric Dutton and hegemony in British Africa,"This essay examines the career of Eric Dutton in five British African colonies from 1919 to 1952, with case studies of his work in Lusaka and Zanzibar. In analyzing Dutton's career, I use a Gramscian conception of the role of intellectuals in creating colonial hegemony, against the backdrop of recent research on the relationship of geography to colonial discourse. Dutton worked and corresponded with key players in Britain's African empire. He was a major force behind early urban-planning programs in East and Central Africa and author of four geographical books. Permanently disabled by war wounds, he was also permanently infatuated with the moral rightness of British imperial culture. A concern for geography's professional relationship with, and the geographical legacy of, colonialism has emerged in recent scholarship on Africa, largely through studies of travel writing, fiction, and nineteenth- or early twentieth-century exploration geography. Later scholar-officials like Dutton sought to apply their knowledge to the shaping of spaces to serve the Empire's direct and immediate needs in Africa, even while trying to win the hearts and minds of its subject peoples. Around Timothy Mitchell's (1988) concept of ""enframing,"" I build an analysis of the spatial projects with which Dutton is most associated and show how Lusaka and Zanzibar were enframed by his plans. Through his publications and correspondences, as well as his seemingly omnipresent service, Dutton has an important legacy that has neither been articulated nor analyzed, one which points to the importance of contextualized biography for analyses of colonial discourse. I argue here for seeing Dutton as an intellectual in the service of colonial hegemony and its enframing spatial discourse, although the character of his agency exemplifies why that attempted hegemony failed.",Africa; Colonialism; Cultural hegemony,Myers G.A.,10.1111/1467-8306.00082
50,27.0,1989,Article,"Space, culture and urban design in late modernism and after","Among the questions underlying recent debates about the architecture of the city, two are perhaps more fundamental. The first concerns the legitimacy of architectural practice: can we be assertive about how we should design our cities without seeking to enforce social assumptions which are ultimately authoritarian? The second concerns architectural theory itself: can we be specific about what architecture does without being reductive about what society is? This article identifies and criticizes two kinds of recent responses to these questions: the first is to defend an architecture of localism and containment in some new and some old ways; the second is to retreat into relativism, sometimes supported by the assertion that architecture is of limited consequence because society is increasingly independent of space. The article defends the view that we can and must be assertive about the architecture of cities in global rather than local terms. The experience of genuinely urban environments is about meeting, though not necessarily interacting with, other people, mostly unknown, who can be of recognizably different class, status, race or ethnic origin; it is also about exploring the strange, and becoming aware of, though not necessarily participating in, other ways of life. -from Author",,Peponis J.,
52,26.0,2008,Article,Imagining Portland's urban growth boundary: Planning regulation as cultural icon,"Problem: In the 30 years since its creation, has Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation? Spirited debate about its impacts on land uses and values has inspired vivid descriptions by both supporters and critics and spurred the imagination of artists and creative writers. Purpose: The UGB has become a symbol, metaphor, and touchstone, as people read complex meanings into it that go beyond its simple legal function. This article looks at the UGB as a cultural icon. It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media.Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives. Takeaway for practice: In the world of 21st-century planning theory there is a strong assumption that many voices engaged in overlapping conversations can help shape more equitable and sustainable cities. Creative depictions of Portland's UGB show the role of cultural actors in shaping and enriching such conversations.",Culture and regulation; Oregon; Urban growth boundary (UGB); Portland,"Abbott C., Margheim J.",10.1080/01944360801944997
55,24.0,2016,Article,Urban planning in Qatar: strategies and vision for the development of transit villages in Doha,"Doha, the capital city of the State of Qatar, has went through a fast growth in its economy and transformation of its built environment. Currently, major urban public transit systems are under construction. This paper looks at Souq Waqif station and its surrounding neighbourhood as one of the new transit hubs of Qatar. The district is located in the core of Doha and plays a significant role in the social, economic and particularly culture, as a way of life, of the people in Qatar. Within the context of Doha, there is an urge to implement transit villages, also defined as transit-oriented developments (TODs), in most of the existing centres along the rail network. A TOD is a mixed use commercial and residential area designed to maximise access to public transport and to encourage transit ridership. Therefore, it is critical to understand the benefits and impacts that TODs would invite in this context before investing large funds in developing them. The research empirically investigates the level at which transit villages can be implemented and also formed within the built environment of Doha. It is argued that this strategy and vision would encourage sustainable development by supporting better transport integration and land use. The aim is to assess and promote sustainable developments integration in the city of Doha through controlling increasing traffic and planning for transit villages. In order to develop a strategy for intervention, the existing TOD case study of Yeerongpilly in Australia was analysed, followed by the exploration of the conditions of the existing Souq Waqif area. The assessment of the Souq Waqif allowed judgments of the existing development to be made, which in turn leads to the draft of potential recommendations and suggestions for the formation and implementation of transit villages in Doha. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",built environment; Doha Metro; TODs; urban fabric,"Zaina S., Zaina S., Furlan R.",10.1080/07293682.2016.1259245

How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of ‘ risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of ‘ emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature. Others, such as the sustainability of the sector's activities have been an issue for longer. Most recently of all, the question as to how festival and event activities are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated, in response to the harsh realities negatively affecting the health of the sector in very recent times. The 35 concepts that are discussed in this volume are laid out in alphabetical order. © Bernadette Quinn 2013.",,Quinn B.,10.4135/9781473914742
62,22.0,2008,Article,Property rights and landscape planning in the intermountain west: The Teton Valley case,"Non-participation in landscape planning presents a formidable challenge to sustainable development. We hypothesize that even when people hold negative attitudes toward unplanned development, natural property rights values (favorable evaluations of property as an inviolable and pre-political right) prevent them from acting on their concerns. We chose an intermountain west community as a case study to evaluate our hypothesis regarding natural property rights values. All groups were equally and strongly opposed to continuation of rapid unplanned growth, but those with natural property rights values were also adamantly opposed to land use planning. We used a multiple logistic regression model to evaluate the relationship between support for landscape planning and a natural property rights values. An overall significance test of the regression equation indicated the independent variables were significantly predictive of the dependent variable (χ2 128, 8 d.f., p &lt; 0.001) and had high (88.7%) predictive capacity. Natural property rights value was the most important predictor variable, but income was also significant. Sustainable landscape planning requires uncoupling property rights from inviolable and pre-political natural rights.

64,21.0,2010,Review,Population and climate change.,"To review, the four broad dimensions of any complex human problem, including climate change, are the human population, economics, culture, and environment. These dimensions interact with one another in all directions and on many time-scales. From 2010 to 2050, the human population is likely to grow bigger, more slowly, older, and more urban. It is projected that by 2050 more than 2.6 billion people (almost 94% of global urban growth) will be added to the urban population in today's developing countries. That works out to 1.26 million additional urban people in today's developing countries every week from 2010 to 2050. Humans alter the climate by emitting greenhouse gases, by altering planetary albedo, and by altering atmospheric components. Between 1900 and 2000, humans' emissions of carbon into the atmosphere increased fifteenfold, while the numbers of people increased less than fourfold. Population growth alone, with constant rates of emissions per person, could not account for the increase in the carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The world economy grew sixteenfold in the twentieth century, accompanied by enormous increases in the burning of gas, oil, and coal. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, population grew much faster in developing countries than in high-income countries, and, compared with population growth, the growth of carbon emissions to the atmosphere was even faster in developing countries than in high-income countries. The ratio of emissions-to-population growth rates was 2.8 in developing countries compared with 1.6 in high-income countries. Emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are influenced by the sizes and density of settlements, the sizes of households, and the ages of householders. Between 2010 and 2050, these demographic factors are anticipated to change substantially. Therefore demography will play a substantial role in the dynamics of climate changes. Climate changes affect many aspects of the living environment, including human settlements, food production, and diseases. These changes will affect poor people more severely than rich, and poor nations more severely than rich. Yet not enough is known to predict quantitatively many details that will matter enormously to future people and other species. Three kinds of responses are related to demographic issues that affect climate changes: universal secondary education, voluntary contraception and maternal health services, and smarter urban design and construction. These responses may prevent, reduce, or ameliorate the impacts of climate changes. They are as relevant to rich countries as to poor, though in ways that are as different as are rich countries and poor. They are desirable in their own right because they improve the lives of the people they affect directly; and they are desirable for their beneficial effects on the larger society and globe. They are effective responses to the twin challenges of reducing poverty and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",,Cohen J.E.,
65,21.0,2009,Article,"Factors affecting compliance with residential standards in the city of Old Salt, Jordan","The aim of this paper is to examine the factors which impact on the extent to which urban housing complies with residential standards in the city of Old Salt based in Jordan. The research found that the level of compliance with residential standards is quite low and can vary from one standard to another and from one house to another due to differences in the socio-economic characteristics among people. The findings of multiple regression analysis reveal that there is a good level of public awareness of residential standards, but this does not result in complete compliance with residential standards. Factors, such as household income per month, household size, finance facilities, municipal administration culture, monitoring, enforcement and the uncertainty of residential standards have a significant impact on the extent of compliance with planning standards. Suggestions for improved urban planning practices which address these issues are summarised in the paper and include reassessed current residential standards through comprehensive legal frameworks, linking residential standards with urban design approaches, changing planning practices, developing information systems to produce effective monitoring systems of construction processes and enforcement mechanisms, the development of local staff including planners, designers and environmental engineers, supported partnerships between private and public sectors, and the use of participatory planning and citizen involvement.

67,20.0,2010,Book,Cities and design,"Cities, initially a product of the manufacturing era, have been thoroughly remade in the image of consumer society. Competitive spending among affluent households has intensified the importance of style and design at every scale and design professions have grown in size and importance, reflecting distinctive geographies and locating disproportionately in cities most intimately connected with global systems of key business services. Meanwhile, many observers still believe good design can make positive contributions to people's lives. ities and Design explores the complex relationships between design and urban environments. It traces the intellectual roots of urban design, presents a critical appraisal of the imprint and effectiveness of design professions in shaping urban environments, examines the role of design in the material culture of contemporary cities, and explores the complex linkages among designers, producers and distributors in contemporary cities, for example: fashion and graphic design in New York; architecture, fashion and publishing in London; furniture, industrial design, interior design and fashion in Milan; haute couture in Paris and so on. This book offers a distinctive social science perspective on the economic and cultural context of design in contemporary cities, presenting cities themselves as settings for design, design services and the 'affect' associated with design. © 2011 Paul L.

72,19.0,2014,Book,Blue urbanism: Exploring connections between cities and oceans,"What would it mean to live in cities designed to foster feelings of connectedness to the ocean? As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like ""community supported fisheries"" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more ""green."" Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of ""ocean literacy"" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals. © 2014 Timothy Beatley.

73,19.0,2004,Article,Toronto and Vancouver bound: The location choice of new Canadian immigrants,"Ethnic clustering plays an important role in the location choice of new immigrants to Canada. A concentration of people in the same geographic area who are of similar ethnic background, culture and language can be an important source of financial and personal support, information and guidance, and social mores. Evidence is found that, after controlling for a range of other observable and unobservable factors important to the location decision, the concentration of people of a particular ethnic group in a particular area has a significant effect on the chance that new immigrants of the same ethnic group will choose to live there. The size of the effect, however, depends on the personal characteristics of immigrants. The attraction of ethnic concentrations of immigrants is significantly smaller for new immigrants with a university degree and for those who normally speak English at home. Characteristics of the local ethnic community related to education and language profiles are also significant determinants of location choice. © 2004 by the Institute of Urban Studies All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Immigrants; Mobility; Neighborhood effects,McDonald J.T.,
77,18.0,2009,Article,"Town planning in postcolonial India, 1947-1965: Chandigarh re-examined","The objective of this article is to reassess the new town building movement in India from 1947 to 1965 through a re-examination of the making of Chandigarh, to show how nationalism, modernism, and local regional influences affected the design and building of new towns. Chandigarh emerged as part of the post-Partition need for a new capital for the Punjab, and involved the efforts of several people and levels of government. The context of newly achieved nationhood became important in the way it shaped the ideals of both national and local political leaders, who wanted architects to transfer these into built form. How successful the architects were in this enterprise was shaped by their professional ideologies and understanding (or lack of it) of the local. Much scholarship exists on issues such as early decisions about Chandigarh's establishment, the Mayer and Le Corbusier plans for the city, and the buildings comprising the Capitol complex that were designed by Le Corbusier. Much less attention has been given to the residential areas of Chandigarh and all that lay beyond the Capitol complex and constitutes the actual town. How did the ideas of modernism, the requirements of the nationalist state, and concern for the local shape the built environment? Was a Western urban design simply replicated here or were there modifications to suit locality and culture? Copyright © 2009 by Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.

78,18.0,2008,Article,"Scales, regimes, and the urban governance of Glasgow","Over the last two decades, urban regime theory has become one of the most dominant paradigms of thought in urban studies. In particular, regime theory offers a complex account of urban governance, or how local governments, the business communities, and community organizations gain the capacity to shape the policies that affect cities, that is, govern. Although regime theory is a dominant theory in urban studies, it does, nevertheless, have its share of detractors, and one criticism has been its failure to take into account geographical scale. While there is an acknowledgment in urban regime theory of wider economic processes, such as the broad transformations in international and national trade, investment, finance, etc., or the role played by federal or state governments, the bias has remained mostly local, particularly in regards to urban governance. In urban regime theory literature the policies and actions of international and national institutions either nicely conjoin with local interests or are nearly totally absent. Due to this oversight, urban regime theory tends to underemphasize how the capacity to govern a city effectively is sometimes the result of the interaction of actions of people at multiple scales. This article attempts to address this oversight in an analysis of Glasgow, Scotland, during the 1980s. By focusing on the role of the European City of Culture in the revitalization of the city, this article demonstrates how the capacity for a ruling coalition to transform the city and to govern effectively was the consequence of the policy and administrative actions undertaken at other geographical scales. © 2008 Urban Affairs Association.",,Tretter E.M.,10.1111/j.1467-9906.2007.00375.x

In the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico City (MVMC) located in the high plateau of Mexico City and on former lakes, the dry out policies during the last 300 years have been counterproductive, causing scarcity, pollution, health and environmental problems, subsidence and water conflicts, particularly affecting social vulnerable people. Megacities require an integrated management of water and aquatic systems. - integral water resource management, rainwater harvesting, maintenance and replacement of infrastructure, restoration of ecosystems and urban planning. This implies investments and a water culture including a transparent administration and peaceful negotiation of conflicts regarding concessions, access, and reuse of water allocation.

82,17.0,2010,Article,Study on building plan for enhancing the social health of public apartments,"Mass-produced in a short period of time, Korea's public apartments contributed to easing the housing anxiety of the common people. Nonetheless, they also gave rise to problems of social exclusion and conflict, becoming undesirable facilities that weakened social health. This study examined ways of producing an improved building plan that can raise the level of social health of public apartments, which were consistently built in the past but will no doubt continue to be developed in the future. For this study, the survey method was employed through a questionnaire with visual contents especially developed to raise the level of social health based on two ideas. One was to increase the possibility of social interaction among residents, and the other was to increase opportunities for residents to interact with society as well as for their social integration. The results showed that residents had mostly favorable views on the proposed plans: in particular, they favored highly the formation of a lobby in each apartment building as a venue for social interaction. They also responded very favorably to the plan of creating within the buildings spare space that will be used not only to promote a communal culture, but to open to outside society as well for integration. This study showed vital ideas to ensure the recovery of the residential function of promoting social health in the public apartments of Korea. It has significance in inspiring an innovative approach to allow social mixture in a relatively different feasible manner from the conventional approach. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is argued that central state, local state, church and voluntary agencies resort to different understandings of pity in order to acknowledge responsibility for different groups of homeless people and shape action in a variety of local settings. Official rhetoric addresses visible homelessness but conceals exclusions, selecting deserving from non-deserving clients and 'clean-ups' of public spaces.

85,16.0,2010,Article,Community of trust: A socio-cultural approach for community planning and the case of Gaza,"This paper defines Community of Trust as socio-spatial settings in which there are substantial trust relationships among people and where they feel defended (safe) from internal risks. Our scheme suggests five categories of conditions that together create Communities of Trust: Shared place, shared daily-life practices, shared basic beliefs, and shared perceptions of community interests and risks. This scheme was examined in five communities in Gaza city. Data were collected first by informal talks with residents and local decision-makers and then by means of 973 personal interviews in residents' homes. Undoubtedly, the human conditions of the people of Gaza are among the worst in the world. Living conditions in the city have been difficult for the past century due to a number of factors, including: waves of incoming Palestinian refugees of the War of 1948, and decades of Israeli occupation. In spite of difficult housing conditions, poor services and the pressure of lasting internal risks, this study found livable communities and strong trust relationships among people of Gaza's communities. This article explains this by the high levels of agreement on basic beliefs, the shared daily-life practices, the strong shared perception towards external risks and a few common interests, which were found within each studied area. The last part of the paper is related to the issues of generalizing from the case of homogeneous urban community in Gaza to the frequently heterogeneous communities of Western cities. This study concludes that trust relationships are the corner-stone upon which communities are based anywhere in the world. Hence, in order to sustain communities, planners should support trust relationships among residents.

88,14.0,2016,Book,Hong Kong architecture 1945-2015: From colonial to global,"This book focuses on the transformation from colonial to global - the formation, mechanism, events, works and people related to urban architecture. The book reveals hardships the city encountered in the 1950s and the glamour enjoyed in the 1980s. It depicts the public and private developments, and especially the public housing which has sheltered millions of residents. The author identifies the architects practising in the formative years and the representatives of a rising generation after the 1980s. Suffering from land shortage and a dense environment, the urban development of Hong Kong has in the past 70 years met the changing demands of fluctuating economic activities and a rising population. Architecture on the island has been shaped by social demands, the economy and technology. The buildings have been forged by the government, clients, planners, architects, many contractors and end-users. The built environment nurtures our life and is visual evidence of the way the city has developed. Hong Kong is a key to East Asia in the Pacific Era. The book is a must-read for a thorough understanding the contemporary history and architecture of this oriental pearl. Endorsement: ""Hong Kong sets an extreme example of hyper-density living.

Although infrastructure is conceived and designed with particular goals and capacities, its temporal and spatial scale means that it is a constant work in progress that engages numerous agents: civic authorities design and implement infrastructure; designated agencies maintain and repair infrastructure; and ordinary people utilize, modify, ignore or destroy it. Infrastructure can be thus analyzed as a materialization of ongoing communication, in which there are often conflicts among different constituents to achieve consensus. The linguistic concepts of expert language and turn-taking are utilized to assess three brief case studies: historical New Orleans; a multipurpose micro-park in Vienna, Austria; and the archaeological city of Sisupalgarh, India. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",communication; consensus; identity; Infrastructure; performance; turn-taking,Smith M.L.,10.1080/00438243.2015.1124804
90,14.0,2014,Book,"Visual pollution: Advertising, signage and environmental quality","In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the problems that public spaces face because of the design of commercial signs. The negative consequences that commercial signs can have on the visual quality of urban areas and further more, on people's quality of life, has been studied from both architectural, planning and psychological perspectives. While the issue of visual pollution, as this phenomenon is commonly described, has been widely debated, there is as yet no clear conclusion as to how best to control commercial signage and whether different urban contexts and people from different backgrounds and cultures have universal or distinct preferences. Several different commenrcial signage approaches are currently applied to different historic cities, but these initiatives are not based on principles derived from the perception and evaluation of users. Drawing on a range of comparative and contrasting empirical studies of historic city centres in the UK and Brazil, this book examines questions of commercial signage control management, the preservation of historic heritage and user preference and satisfaction. The author takes an environment behaviour approach to this research, involving theories, concepts and methodologies related to environmental psychology, architecture, planning and urban design. In doing so, it argues that there are in fact visual preferences common to the majority of people, independent of their urban context and that these common views can be useful to the development of a general theory of how to control commercial signage. In conclusion, the book suggests that the best way of controlling signage is not only to recommend general guidelines related to the operation of commercial signage, but also to recommend design principles that can create commercial streetscapes evaluated positively by different users. © Adriana Portella 2014.

92,14.0,1989,Article,"Human Nature, Society and the Home","The New Psychology', which combines biology, psychology and the social sciences, is now generating considerable insights and debates. Such work gives special emphasis to 'the expressive orders; people's own understandings and statements deriving from the innate drives affecting their behaviour as well as the socially-constructed cultures of which they are part. Housing and urban studies, this paper suggests, should be part of these developments. Involvement in such issues should, for example, help us address questions which have recently been raised in Housing Studies by Saunders and Williams. They underlined the fact that the home is of central significance to the lives of individuals and they suggested that the significance of the home for contemporary social change has been underestimated. The intention of the present paper is to suggest that the new syntheses of ethology, sociobiology, social psychology and sociology might be one means of establishing the home's wider significance and its centrality to people's lives and identities. This paper concludes by arguing that housing studies could make major contributions to this emergent combination of the natural and social sciences. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

After decades of individualism, to reconstruct a republican culture might be necessary, but it very difficult and not a short-term objective. It should be kept in mind that while strategic planning and planning in general are opportunities for the government and dependent on political will, land-use planning, even in a simplified zoning form, is a necessity: the urban market needs it; there is no way of managing city growth without some form of grids and regulations.

99,12.0,2008,Editorial,Introduction modern architecture and the middle east: The burden of representation,"The essays in this volume investigate the contribution that local Middle Eastern contexts make to discourses in international modernism. The essayists define modernization not only as the extension of industrialized building processes and urban infrastructure, but also as the spread of ideals of progress and standards of comfort-which is to say, modernization is the ideology as well as the built framework for the administration of industrial societies. Architecture can help consolidate identity by providing both a degree of social cohesion and iconic forms that can become a source of pride for communities. Yet, for others, such architectural forms can become stereotypes that flatten culture into amere sign.Throughout these essays, one discerns an abiding concern for questions of representation, for how buildings and monuments-or in some cases, the lack of them- acquiremeaning, harden conviction, and set the spatial infrastructure for subsequent generations. The Middle East, with its diverse social, religious, and national histories, has often been seen by architects and academics as rich in traditional architecture but poor as a resource for understanding the Modern period. Europeans have idealized the Middle East as an almost timeless place, a region that stands in distinct and didactic contrast with the disruptive displacement and disillusionment that has resulted from its own industrialization.1 These essays describe the unique ways by which Middle Eastern countries have invented their own versions of modernism, sometimes aligned and sometimes at odds with more familiar European versions, and in varying relations with larger patterns of imperialism and colonialism. When individual designers and decision makers crossed national borders to build or to learn, to provide aid or extract resources, as architects, teachers, or tourists, the dichotomies of modern-traditional orWestern-Eastern did not truly hold. Our goal here is to build into the study of transnational architectural exchange the widest consideration of constituencies and the most extended opportunities for input.Contributors examine awide range of cultural encounters in terms of institutionalization of relationships, dynamic interactions of bureaucratic structures, and patterns of patronage amid debates over design and urban planning. Even local histories aremultiple, often disputed in their formation, and inevitably shifting over time. Taken together, they illustrate the various strategies that set national policies and decidewho is housed and who goes wanting, who is remembered and who is forgotten, and who is empowered to remake the built landscape. Several essays profile the individuals who helped realize certain specificallyMiddle Eastern forms of modernity. Some of them, such as European art historians and expatriate architects and archeologists, positioned themselves as the arbiters of Western knowledge, while others were seen as importingWestern ideals and technologies to theMiddle East. In other cases, institutions, such as governments or development agencies, assumed these roles. In many instances, however, cultural authority was as much a matter of dynamic transitions in political or architectural sympathies as it was the result of official credentials. These essays call attention to circuits of intention and response, which inflamed allegedly objective depictions of technological progress into heated debates regarding the nature of modernity itself. Modernism and the Middle East contextualizes the challenges facing building efforts today by placing themwithin a larger historical trajectory stretching from colonialism and the rise of nation-states to the present postcolonial search for local identity.By detailing howarchitecture has been integral to complex political ambitions and economic programs, the contributors make evident the historical roles played by competing visions of the built environment, as forms of representation and as ameans of directing capital and labor flows. With such attention to its deep traditions and rapidmodernization, the Middle East emerges as a rich setting for the study of modern architecture. Modernism and the Middle East begins at the cusp of the twentieth century amid the decline of colonialism and the rise of independent nation-states in regions once ruled by theOttomans (r. 1290-1924) in present-day Turkey and North Africa, and the Qajars (r. 1779-1924) in Iran (see fig. I.1).2 Under the dynastic leadership of the Sultan, overseer of the holy sites of Mecca andMedina and the supreme ruler of the Sunni Islamic world, the relatively stable and unified Ottoman Empire had administeredmuch of today's Middle East. But this administrative unity and geographic cohesion was eroded greatly during the nineteenth century, and it dissolved completely in the twentieth.3 Beyond the actual loss of land, Ottoman rule was disrupted by major infrastructure developments, most notably the Suez Canal (1854-69), which brought French and, later, English capital and technology to Egypt.4 By the twilight of World War I, in 1918, Istanbul had itself come under Allied control, and the six-hundred-year-oldOttoman Empire came to an end, its former lands divided into areas administered by the French (Syria and Lebanon) and the British (Iraq and Palestine).5 Even as newnations emerged with at least nominal sovereignty from the Mandate period, the idea of a coherent, if not exactly cohesive, Middle East was reinforced. The Mandates carved new political entities, such as Palestine and Iraq, out of former Ottoman administrative zones, but it kept these nations from being fully independent, and left them wanting in terms of industrial development. At the same time, European occupation sparked nationalist movements in neighboring Turkey and Iran, resulting in the overthrow of puppet monarchies and the rise of charismatic military leaders,who threwoff centuries of imperial rule and modernized in the name of national progress. The advent of Mustafa Kemal in Turkey (1919) and Riza Khan in Iran (1921) brought new modes of judicial and educational reforms (often based on European models), in an effort to forge homogeneous, if fictive, native identities.6 The characterization of entire peoples by their positions along the trajectory of history and modernization was asmuch embraced by regional leaders as it was imposed by European power and ideology. Oil came to be written into this idea of a cohesive Middle East as much by its discovery there as by the increasing industrial thirst for sources of fuel. The image of Arab states unified by oceans of oil lying unseen beneath their soil emerged in the nineteenth centurywith the advent of a British-controlled Anglo-Persian oil company. It was extended as new fields were discovered, such as those in Iraq in the 1930s and those in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia by 1945. With the institution of the American's Marshall Plan (1948-52), the European economy was reconfigured according to American precepts, resulting in an emphasis on continued growth in productivity and an even greater dependence on oil. The Middle East thus moved to the center of foreign-policy strategies for a number of Western nations, becoming also a site of contentious ideological positioning between the Soviet Union and the United States, with both nations acting out their political differences through technical aid and development projects as well as cultural exports. Although some small Persian Gulf monarchies enjoyed considerable advantages over their oil-poor neighbors, toWesterners the regionmaintained its conceptual integrity as a site of superpower struggle and vast economic opportunity.7 The creation of the state of Israel, on May 14, 1948, also helped consolidate an idea of the Middle East, albeit in a way unanticipated by mostWestern politicians. Although Jewish immigration to the area in the first half of the twentieth century had profoundly accected the economic and demographic character of Mandate Palestine, the United Nations' 1947 plan to partition the area into Jewish and Arab states,whichwas rejected by the Arab League, formed in 1945, seemed only to reassert Western colonialism at the very moment it was breaking apart elsewhere. Within this context, theMiddle Eastmust be historically situated as a place defined both by European colonial interests and by the specific imperial configurations that had existed in the region. Just as the specter of essentialism hovers over the term ""Middle East,"" one may argue that it also haunts the idea of a homogeneous ""Europe""; nonetheless, as Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued in another context, these terms highlight, rather than obfuscate, the problematic of domination and intellectual dependency that permeates any discussion of these two entities.8 The interdependency of Europe and the Middle East can be seen in the unfolding of an ""Oriental"" supplement to European identity: what was understood by nineteenth-century policymakers as the ""Eastern question"" had to do less with the inhabitants of these regions than with the raw currency of human labor and material wealth promised through imperialism. © 2008 by University of Washington Press.

Providing extraordinary examples of how pre-Columbian peoples merged ideas about the cosmos with those concerning calendar and astronomy, the volume showcases the value of detailed examinations of astronomical data for understanding ancient cultures. The volume is divided into three sections: Investigations into Mesoamerican horizon-based astronomy, the cosmological principles expressed in Mesoamerican religious imagery and rituals related to astronomy, and the aspects of Mesoamerican calendars related to archaeoastronomy. It also provides cutting-edge research on diverse topics such as records of calendar and horizon-based astronomical observation (like the Dresden and Borgia codices), iconography of burial assemblages, architectural alignment studies, urban planning, and counting or measuring devices. Contributors—who are among the most respected in their fields— explore new dimensions in Mesoamerican timekeeping and skywatching in the Olmec, Maya, Teotihuacano, Zapotec, and Aztec cultures. It will be of great interest to students and scholars of anthropology, archaeology, art history, and astronomy. © 2015 by University Press of Colorado.",,Milbrath S.,

This distinctive opportunity has lead the authors to explore a form of design brief and virtual design studio (VDS) format not well addressed in the literature. Instead of sharing the same design brief, students in this alternative format design a project in the other students' city and do not collaborate on the same design. Collaboration with other students takes the form of teaching each other about the city and culture served by the design. The authors discovered these studios produce a focus on site context that serves our pedagogical objectives - a blend of architectural, landscape architectural and urban design knowledge. Their students use a range of commercial CAD and computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) software common to that used in many VDS experiments reported on in the literature. However, this conventional use of technology is contrasted with a second distinctive characteristic of these studios, the use of custom software tools specifically designed to support synchronous and asynchronous three-dimensional model exchange and linked attribute knowledge. The paper analyzes some of the virtual design studio (VDS) work between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the University of Toronto, and the University of Melbourne.

104,10.0,2021,Book Chapter,Why Gayborhoods Matter: The Street Empirics of Urban Sexualities,"Urbanists have developed an extensive set of propositions about why gay neighborhoods form, how they change, shifts in their significance, and their spatial expressions. Existing research in this emerging field of “gayborhood studies” emphasizes macro-structural explanatory variables, including the economy (e.g., land values, urban governance, growth machine politics, affordability, and gentrification), culture (e.g., public opinions, societal acceptance, and assimilation), and technology (e.g., geo-coded mobile apps, online dating services). In this chapter, I use the residential logics of queer people—why they in their own words say that they live in a gay district—to show how gayborhoods acquire their significance on the streets. By shifting the analytic gaze from abstract concepts to interactions and embodied perceptions on the ground—a “street empirics” as I call it—I challenge the claim that gayborhoods as an urban form are outmoded or obsolete. More generally, my findings caution against adopting an exclusively supra-individual approach in urban studies. The reasons that residents provide for why their neighborhoods appeal to them showcase the analytic power of the streets for understanding what places mean and why they matter. © 2021, The Author(s).",Gay neighborhoods; LGBTQ+ safe spaces; Technology; Urban sexualities,Ghaziani A.,10.1007/978-3-030-66073-4_4
105,10.0,2019,Conference Paper,Enablers and Barriers of Lean Implementation in Construction Projects,"Lean aims to maximize customer satisfaction while minimizing waste. However, Lean philosophy has not been well understood yet in the construction industry for the fact that the complexity and dynamic nature of construction projects bring up uncertainties that may be hardly handled by construction practitioners. Moreover, project-based nature of construction business makes Lean implementation even more challenging for construction people. Even though Lean efforts in construction have recently increased, there are problems with the implementation processes. It is undeniable that successful Lean implementation strongly affects project performance. Therefore, it is essential to reveal enablers and barriers in Lean implementation so that the construction industry practitioners might conduct projects more effectively and satisfy project requirements (i.e. schedule, budget, safety). This study aims to provide a set of core enablers and barriers of Lean implementation in construction projects and guide construction professionals to better satisfy project requirements. Within this context, the study proposes seven major enabler and barrier groups, namely the financial, managerial, technical, workforce, culture, government, and communication and twenty-seven components for each group. Moreover, a survey was designed and administered to Lean practitioners to rank the enablers and barriers based on importance level. Clear understanding of technical requirements in Lean practices was ranked as the most important enabler of Lean implementation whereas lack of top management support was ranked as the most important barrier in the Lean implementation. However, the average rankings were not found to be diverging indicating that selected components of enabler and barrier groups are properly chosen. The study is expected to lead Lean practitioners with creating value to customers while preventing them from experiencing waste. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayhan H.G., Demirkesen S., Jayamanne E.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/2/022002
107,10.0,2015,Article,Recognition of urban unsustainability in Iran (case study: Sanandaj City),"Rapid urban growth and urbanization in recent decades have caused changes in the structure of human habitations such as social and economic changes that would further clarify the importance of sustainable development and urban sustainability. Urban sustainability should create a balance between different aspects of economic, environmental, and social development. Therefore, this study aimed to determine various aspects of unsustainability in Iranian middle-large cities in order to provide strategies to improve the indicators and to achieve sustainability by finding the causes of failure to develop these indicators. Accordingly, first, urban sustainability indicators in four social, economic, physical and environmental aspects were presented. Then, the process of changing was determined through the study of these indicators in Sanandaj during two different periods; and indicators such as jobs, green urban economics, housing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), social participation, culture, public services and facilities, transportation, leisure, and medical care and health services were specified as unsustainability indicators in Sanandaj and other similar cities. Then, the following strategies are provided to improve urban sustainability in order to analyze the reasons for the decline or stagnation of these indicators: (1) strategies to revise the urban planning system in Iran; (2) strategies to improve the city's economy; and (3) strategies to improve the condition and status of poor people. The declining trend of unsustainability indicators could be reversed by applying these strategies. Furthermore, with the promotion of indicators, sustainable cities could be achievable. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Sustainable development; Urban planning system; Urban sustainability,"Azami M., Mirzaee E., Mohammadi A.",10.1016/j.cities.2015.08.005
108,10.0,2014,Book,Plug & play places: Lifeworlds of multilocal creative knowledge workers,"In post-industrial societies more and more people earn an income in creative knowledge work, a highly flexible labour market segment that demands a geographically mobile workforce. Creative knowledge work is based on an understanding of language, culture and symbolic meanings. This can best be obtained through local and national embeddedness. Yet, this necessity for embeddedness stands in contrast to the demand in geographical mobility. How is this contradiction solved by individuals? What new forms of place attachment does this bring about? This book introduces a showcase of 25 multilocal creative knowledge workers, who live in different countries at the same time. It investigates how continuous mobility becomes part of their lifeworld, and how it changes their feelings of belonging and practices of place attachment. Applying an innovative methodological mix of social phenomenology, hermeneutics and mental mapping, this book takes a detailed look at biographies and the role of places in mobile lifeworlds. Plug&Play Places brings forth the idea that places have to be understood as individual items, which are configured and then plugged into the 'system' of the own lifeworld. They can be 'played' without great effort once an individual needs to make use of them. This new type of place attachment is a form of subjective standardization of place, which complements the well-known models of objective standardization of places. Plug&Play Places is relevant for scientists who deal with mobility and its impact on individual lifeworlds, with transnational multilocality and with flexibilized labour markets. Furthermore, the book provides a detailed qualitative perspective which can enrich the explanations of quantitative research in the same field. It is an interesting reading also for practitioners engaged in urban planning, housing and real estate development. Copyright © 2014 Robert Nadler.",,Nadler R.,10.2478/9783110401745

Efforts should therefore be concentrated on accommodating this phenomenon through the promotion of sustainable urban planning and development. Relying on secondary data, this paper examines models of indigenous African urban forms and architecture to understand these forms and their characteristics, and how these models and associated management, design, and planning principles can be adopted in contemporary SSA urban development in the quest to achieve sustainable urban development. This paper argues that planning is culturally and contextually defined and the specificities of a place are critical in planning. Developing strategies based on indigenous urban forms which embody local peoples' culture, aspirations, experiences, and values is consistent with the concept of sustainable urban development. The article concludes that there exist clear elements of socially, politically, economically, culturally, and environmentally sound and responsive sustainable planning principles to be derived from indigenous urban forms and architecture which can inform current urban development process in SSA. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",indigenous; Sub-Saharan Africa; sustainable urban development; urban form,Asomani-Boateng R.,10.1080/17549175.2011.634573
116,9.0,2000,Article,Integrative analysis of city systems: Bangkok 'man and the biosphere' programme study,"This paper argues that integrative analysis of city systems helps us to see beyond their current environmental and social problems to underlying causes, and it suggests different opportunities for possible interventions. Focusing on a single aspect of a city or its people without understanding its context risks interventions which treat symptoms rather than causes and whose short-term 'solution' often means that the problem returns in the same or perhaps a different form. Our integrative analysis of Bangkok suggests that the root of its environmental (and some social) problems lie in decision-making structures and a political culture which has historically fostered self interested decisions by stakeholders rather than the public interest. This has produced a land use and built environment configuration that largely ignores the functioning of the natural flood plain ecosystem and the well-being of residents. People adapt their behaviour to their environment but often in ways that have serious cumulative impacts on the city. This analysis suggests that problems need to be addressed at their source: the nature of decision-making by stakeholders, at every level. This requires the engagement of all parties inside and outside government, the elite and otherwise. To the extent that planning has a viable role, the focus needs to be on the source of the impacts, such as national development planning, rather than in sectors such as transport, where the problems are evident.",,"Ross H., Poungsomlee A., Punpuing S., Archavanitkul K.",10.1177/095624780001200212
117,9.0,1980,Article,Chicago sociology and urban planning policy - Sociological theory as occupational ideology,"This account has provided one illustration of the possibility of an alternative approach to the sociology of knowledge other than the ""reductionist"" analysis of ideas as mere epiphenomena of material interests. If the sociology of knowledge cannot be pursued in any other fashion, the field's oft-lamented neglect seems entirely justifiable. But sociologists of knowledge can choose to define the purpose of their work, not as the exposure of perceptual distortions conditioned by social position, but as the elucidation of factors which lend certain formulations plausibility within a given socio-cultural context. Ironically, such explication of the relationship of ideology to work has been consonant with the developing Chicago tradition, although not unique to it, for Chicagoans have been concerned to elucidate the means by ""which people respond creatively to the limitations of their institutional context."" As we have seen, the pre-World War II manifestation of that tradition has permitted urban bureaucrats to maximize their possibilities for action within the constraints of their formal obligations. Not only has their faith in the accuracy of evolutionist predictions sustained civil servants in the belief that they have maintained value-neutrality, but it has also allowed them to enjoy the pleasures of power and concrete accomplishment. For the city is conceptualized as an ever-expanding frontier, perpetually subjected to cycles of devastation and construction. Hence, while ostensibly acting as instruments of inexorable historical forces, urban bureaucrats are constantly provided with opportunities to raise tangible monuments to their personal authority. And evolutionist sociology has sanctioned a viable occupational strategy for the bureaucrat qua bureaucrat, for it justifies the civil servants' favored relationship with powerful clients, allowing them to negotiate their continued occupational survival. Although Chicago sociology has proved useful to planning professionals, I do not mean to suggest that its creators would have approved of the consequences of bureaucratic activity. In fact, both in method and substance the practices of government agencies have violated the human ecologists' ideal; Chicagoan Louis Wirth deplored planners' operational categories, arguing that they should be replaced with more sophisticated sociological ones. More importantly, federal officials used Chicago sociologists' projections to support policies counter to the Chicagoans' prescriptions for civilized society. Government policy has been effectively anti-urban. Based on the Chicago evolutionists' model, and in the name of sound business practices, central city decline has been assured and suburban expansion facilitated. Chicago sociologists saw conflict arising from large-scale urban migration and rapid industrialization, but they accepted conflict as necessary to progress; the highest development of civilization required diversity and an urban milieu. Within the city various groups created homogeneous communities, but heterogeneity of the population as a whole was essential to urban culture. Federal agencies, while adhering to the sociologists' premises, turned the model on its head; they sought to minimize conflict by eradicating social heterogeneity, and encouraged the growth of homogeneous suburban neighborhoods in which residents were protected from alien persons and lifestyles. © 1980 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.",,Kuklick H.,10.1007/BF00169091
118,8.0,2021,Article,A sociotechnical approach to causes of urban blight using fuzzy cognitive mapping and system dynamics,"Urban blight often is prominent in urban environments. It consists of real estate degradation to the extent that blighted residential properties, unfortunately, may provide housing only for the poorest social classes. Urban blight reduces real property values in urban neighborhoods and urban centers, reduces business investment and increases unemployment. Urban blight is not static, but continuously changing, either getting worse or improving. Thus, it is an issue of growing concern for urban decision makers who may attempt to determine its causes. Determining causes of urban blight facilitates the development of strategic measures for the prevention and potential eradication of this phenomenon. This study seeks to bolster the identification of factors that cause urban blight and makes important contributions to both the academic communities and society at large. By combining fuzzy cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach, our proposal facilitates the identification of urban blight determinants and the development of alternatives to control and eradicate them. Data used in our study were provided by a panel of urban blight experts, and allowed for the identification of the following major causes of urban blight: deficiencies in sociability and/or culture; unfavorable economic and financial factors; policy and/or administrative shortages; lack of urban regeneration; insecurity for people and assets; and building and/or surroundings defects. The results of our decision-support system were analyzed and validated by an independent expert who works for the Lisbon City Council in Portugal.

119,8.0,2020,Article,Investigating learning and diffusion strategies for sustainable mobility,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the concepts of learning and diffusion within the context of urban development and sustainable active mobility. A model is proposed, which treats learning as a diffusion process in a dynamic way, so that key strategies and their effects are investigated over time. Specifically, the question being examined is how learning and information technology strategies can change the mindset of people to be more physically active in their mobility around a city. This is carried out by developing a system dynamics (SD) computer simulation model, where learning strategies that promote walking can be tested prior to implementation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the specific key stages of knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation, the proposed SD model incorporates individual citizen and group level learning and diffusion processes in a unified integrated approach. The SD model gives a clear picture on how learning and changing mindsets occur in the context of a city, whereby we can explore the main drivers to learn new sustainability related habits. A case study is used to contextualize and demostrate the active mobility issue, in order to develop practical scenarios for promoting a walking mindset. This is done in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model and show its practicality. Through the model we investigate the relationships among variables such as awareness, contact, communication and adoption and evaluate their impact on city policies to promote a walking mindset. Findings: The developed SD model exhibits important dimensions, such as social learning, motivation to change behaviour and an analysis of the effects of plausible strategies for promoting sustainable active mobility. The authors have proven that through simulation experimentation, we can significantly accelerate the shaping and diffusion of a walking mindset, by influencing individual and community learning via the introduction of Information and Communication Technology in conjunction with an awareness campaign strategy. Research limitations/implications: The diagrammatic representation and the quantification of the factors that contribute to active mobility give rise to better understanding of how policy makers could promote a walking culture in a city. The implications are that the proposed SD model could be used by city planning authorities as a framework for shaping mindsets towards active and sustainable mobility. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the further understanding of learning, diffusion of new ideas and strategic planning within the city context. Through the proposed SD model, a number of strategies are formulated and tested using scenario planning, sensitivity analysis and optimization, in order to develop a walking mindset and an urban culture of sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Active mobility; Diffusion theory; Learning capability; Organizational learning; System dynamics; Urban development,"Papageorgiou G., Demetriou G.",10.1108/SASBE-02-2019-0020

Despite lip-service to ""triple bottom line"" assessments of policies and developments, Australia's policymakers have advanced no further than a ""double bottom line"" based on economic and environmental values, the latter preferably expressed in dollar terms. The economic (or market relation) also substitutes for the social dimension in a continued policy emphasis on customers rather than citizens or community members. An overemphasis on behavioural economics, a lack of social, political and cultural theory, and neglect of people's actual practices means that much policy and research around water fails to grapple with such basic social elements as gender, different roles and access to resources within households, cultural diversity, or ethical orientations. A major challenge is to mobilise rather than ignore the altruistic and socially-oriented human capacities for adapting to change beyond the customer relation or the confines of technical and economic rationality; including by collective innovations in values and practices of caring for water. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.",Cultural innovation; Customer behaviour; Gender and water; Household water; Socially sustainable urban water; Sustainability models,Sofoulis Z.,10.7158/W13-018.2013.17.2

COVID-19-induced immobility in the mobile risk society,"Since the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declared the Coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, the virus has invaded lives around the globe. The ongoing health, social and economic crisis that followed forced urban life, business, culture, community etc. into idle mode for weeks resulting from mandated immobility. What was once taken for granted as the essence of urban experience such as cultural activities, meeting friends, relatives and colleagues in public space or in professional encounters, disappeared overnight. Free movement became significantly restricted all over the world. It seemed that immobility, social and physical distancing, and isolation were the only antidote to the fast-moving virus. For many people, working from home while also schooling their children and providing social care at a distance, peak activity at maximum physical immobility became the “new normal.” A culture emerged where rules and norms of mobilities previously taken for granted were re-negotiated and re-defined. Before the crisis and despite the negative ecological side effects, mobility has been positively connotated as a signifier for progress and success. Under the Corona regime mobility turned into a life-threatening risk.

In underdeveloped countries this fact is expressed in a chaotic manner, generating social and structural problems. The city of Rio de Janeiro is a megalopolis known worldwide for its natural beauties, including beaches and forests and because of favelas (subnormal clusters of houses of economically poor people).The favelas are composed of a mosaic of cultures which reflects even in urban afforestation. In this work we characterize the afforestation structure of a favela to understand its ecological and social functionalities. The survey was conducted in the favela Morro da Formiga, with an area of approximately 30 ha. It was conducted through a census and using the list of species, a classification based on 11 parameters was carried out. 1,042 individuals were found, belonging to 110 genera, 148 species and 42 families. The most abundant species shows that the planters intend is, leastwise partially, generating an extra-support for community in terms of feeding fruits (62% of the subjects had this purpose). In relation to the nature thereof, the natives species represents 54% of the total, while the exotic species 39%. About 50% of the trees are in the backyards of houses and a few in squares and streets. It was found that 70% of individuals were planted by residents. Studies are needed to identify which native species can replace community demands currently supplied by exotic species that have been used for decades. The “forestation” in favelas is quite distinct from that implemented by the city hall in more urbanized areas.

Specifically, the article explores the relationship between the spatial dynamics of the conflicts-in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity-and the following four dimensions of urban space: social composition; built environment; propensity to associate and to voice; and accessibility to various urban resources. The results of statistical analyses by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Mann-Whitney test show, regardless of the dimension considered, to what extent certain areas are characterized by frequency, duration, or intensity of the conflict activity. Specifically, the results suggest that the degree of involvement of local people in a conflict varies very much depending on the nature of the social composition. Other findings show a relationship between areas with a high propensity to associate and to voice and a conflict activity that is more intense, more frequent, but not necessarily longer. These forms of social practices are thus testimony to the existence of know-how, i.e., a culture of conflict activity oriented towards efficiency. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Spatial analysis; Statistical analysis; Territorial decision-making processes; Urban conflicts; Urban environments,"Pelletier M., Joerin F., Kestens Y., Villeneuve P.Y.",10.1007/s12061-010-9050-8

The developments so far, however, have seen humans mostly as users and consumers rather than as active contributors and designers. This paper provides a conceptual framework based on meta-design and cultures of participation that democratize design and allows all stakeholders to evolve systems to fit their needs. It establishes a new extended discourse for HCI research in which information technologies are interwoven with human lives in all aspects of our existence (at home, working, teaching, learning, and being a citizen). Specific socio-technical environments instantiating the framework in different application domains are described, including: (1) environments for people with cognitive disabilities, (2) table-top computing systems for framing and solving complex urban planning problems, (3) modeling the buildings of the world in 3D, and (4) using Smart Grids to support energy sustainability. These examples show how metadesign and cultures of participation are design approaches that allow researchers and practitioners to extend boundaries by allowing all stakeholders to have more control over their artifacts and by providing opportunities to encourage and to support contributions by many people in personally meaningful activ ities. © 2010 ACM.",Boundaries; Control; Cultures of participation; Distances; Meta-design; Motivation; Socio-technical environments; Systemic problems,Fischer G.,10.1145/1868914.1868937

By examining contemporary digital art that critiques the spatial inequalities encountered by U.S. racial minorities, this article illustrates how public intellectuals use ICTs in ways that draw upon past strategies to territorialize space for political ends. It focuses on digital pop-ups, open-air installations that cast images onto public space using projectors. Historicizing these new efforts illustrates a continuity of tactics engaged by communities of color in response to socio-spatial inequalities in the urban United States, such as the 1970s mural movement’s efforts to re-politicize spaces of exclusion. While existing literature finds that digital inequality results in differential digital human capital, this research indicates that place-based claims, such as digital pop-ups, are important sites for combatting racial injustice and creating more inclusionary spaces, especially among youth adults. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital arts; Digital divide; race; urban studies; young people,Carpio G.G.,10.1080/1369118X.2016.1271899
144,6.0,2017,Article,"Disruption, resilience, and vernacular heritage in an Indian city: Pune after the 1961 floods","This paper offers insights into production of vernacular architectural heritage that result from disruption caused by disaster such as a flood in a city. To understand the complexities surrounding vernacular heritage, this paper proposes a conceptual approach derived from Lefebvre’s theory of production of space constituting the triad of spatial practice, representation of spaces and representational space. The strength of this approach in explaining resilience and vernacular architectural heritage is illustrated by examining rehabilitation settlements that evolved after the devastating floods of 1961 in Pune (a city with a population of 4.5 million). The paper focuses on the rehabilitation process that was undertaken in response to the floods and relies on secondary data and primary field observations in the rehabilitated settlements. It was found that these settlements had twofold characteristics; externally, they directed the trajectory of growth and expansion of the city owing to their strategic location in the periphery around the old core, and internally within, they contributed to reshaping of urban form and vernacular architecture as the affected people reconstructed their houses and everyday lives. A significant contribution to the making of these rehabilitation spaces was the state’s provision of land for rehabilitation and encouragement to the mechanism of Cooperative Housing as a representation of space incorporating contemporary planning ideologies. These settlements comprised the ‘architecture of the dispossessed’ where material culture and imagery informed different and hybrid forms of houses but these were a departure from the past as they needed to accommodate rebuilding and expansion while serving aspirations of those affected. © 2016, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.",disruption; floods; heritage; India; Pune; resilience; vernacular architecture,Shinde K.A.,10.1177/0042098016652777
146,6.0,2015,Book Chapter,Festive Cities: Multi-Dimensional Perspectives,"Until recently there has been limited attention paid in urban studies to features that relate to sensory, not material features, to consumption not production, pleasure not work, and to episodic rather than permanent characteristics. However festivals, episodic events lasting a few days, do provide such functions. They take people outside their routine behaviours of work, leisure and family, providing joy, excitement and new experiences, sometimes linking to historical traditions. Although such events have always been part of the life of the bigger places, new valuations of their utility have led to an enormous growth in such activities in recent decades, both in numbers within cities, and many other urban places, adding to their vitality and often providing major economic returns. A review of the variety of festivals shows that most fall into six main types, linked to temporal or cyclical, religious, political, tradition-heritage, new cultures and lifestyle functions, although some may overlap the categories and others have morphed from one type to another through time. A multidimensional model of the nature of festivals based on eight components provides a basis for assessing their varied character and reveals their often contradictory nature and conflicted consequences. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Festival dimensions; Festival growth; Festival impacts; Festival typology,Davies W.K.D.,10.1007/978-94-017-9655-2_14
148,6.0,2011,Article,Small businesses and the vitality of main street,"People use the neighborhood Main Street for shopping but also for other leisurely activities, active and passive engagement, social affiliation and interaction, sensory stimulation, and relaxation. Traditionally, small businesses have made up a fair share of businesses on Main Street. Small businesses have been an integral part of the American culture of entrepreneurship, individualism, and self-reliance and have played an important role in American economic development. Community development programs recommend supporting small businesses for their social and economic benefits. This paper examines the role of small businesses in supporting public life on the neighborhood Main Street. The study urn conducted in two cities and one town in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. Extensive behavior mapping and interviews were conducted to determine the relationship between social interaction and small businesses. The findings expand our understanding of the social value of small businesses and suggest a strong relationship between small businesses and the vitality of Main Street as a result offour qualities of small businesses: uniqueness, engagement, friendliness, and responsiveness. These findings have implications for urban design, community planning, and economic development policies because they suggest that small businesses influence their immediate public space by paying more attention to it than large businesses. Small businesses provide qualities that help make Main Street a good place for people to interact. © 2011, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc.",,Mehta V.,

152,6.0,1996,Article,The urban fabric of Igbo architecture in South-eastern Nigeria in the 1990s,"This paper seeks to explore the extent to which local building traditions have been retained within modern urban housing development in primarily Igbo-speaking areas of South-eastern Nigeria in the 1990s. Its premise is that there are vestiges of tradition which remain part of the urban fabric in most southern Nigerian towns. It is thought that these traditions can, and should, be developed further to ensure that there is a positive integration of the old with the new, in the physical form, aesthetics and theoretical interpretation of urban design. Also as a development model, this integration approach has considerable relevance to other aspects of Nigerian urban life where there is the need for the accommodation of various cultures and social backgrounds. Relevant material, including documented data, will be used to discuss the premises and theories put forward. Central to the main theme is the argument for a re-ordering of architectural design and urban planning in southern Nigeria to better accommodate the more traditional or cultural features of life as the illustrations shown will highlight. The paper focuses specifically on the Igbo-speaking area of South-eastern Nigeria. The development of its housing fabric has varied distinctly from that of Northern and South-western Nigeria, which both have the effects of Islamic influence and, in the latter region, Brazilian and European influence, on local culture to be considered. Both these regions have had more urbanised and cosmopolitan cultural indigenous development patterns than the south-east. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with these Nigerian regions and other developing areas. It would seem that 'Igboland' escaped these influences mainly due to its geographical location in the hinterland of South-eastern Nigeria. Islam did not penetrate as far down from North-eastern Nigeria to the south-east as it had done from North-western Nigeria to the south-west. This was partly due to the more tropical humid terrain which was detrimental to horses and mounted warfare and the way in which religious wars or Jihads were traditionally fought. Also, the acephalous societal organisation of the Igbos, when contrasted with the more hierarchical Northern Hausa and Western Yoruba societies, were less predisposed to convert voluntarily from native individualised worship to a more structured heirarchic monotheistic religion. Being away from the Atlantic coast of Nigeria meant that European influence took longer to affect hinterland Igbo lifestyles. It also meant that the area had few settlements of repatriated and freed African slaves who had made their way back to Nigeria from America and Brazil. Called Saros and Agudas respectively, these returnees brought with them new cultural styles and established residential settlements which were influential in the development of coastal towns such as Lagos and Calabar. Similarly, missionary and government enterprise reached the Igbo hinterland much later than the coast, thus Christianity and its cultural influence was felt much later in this area. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with other Nigerian regions and other developing countries.",,Uduku O.,10.1016/0197-3975(95)00052-6
153,5.0,2021,Article,Hybrid coordination of city organisations: The rule of people and culture in the shadow of structures,"Under far-reaching reforms, many cities have delegated core tasks previously delivered by their administrations to independent organisations that they formally own, e.g. municipal companies, or supervise, e.g. municipal trust funds. The coordination of these (as we call them) ‘domestic’ city organisations has proven challenging. Extant literature argues that such coordination is achieved through a mix of various hierarchical, market and network mechanisms. Yet it is unclear how these modes are combined. Addressing this gap, we ask: How do governance modes interact in the hybrid coordination of domestic city organisations? Analysing the case of Vienna, where 100 domestic organisations employ about 60,000 people, we find that while cultural mechanisms, rooted in the network mode, are predominant, they unfold in the shadow of latent structural mechanisms, which are associated with hierarchy and market. In the background, structural mechanisms keep cultural coordination effective, while cultural mechanisms allow structural coordination to remain (generally) hidden. This study aims to contribute to the literature on the governance of public organisations by exploring the relationship between governance modes as well as furthering urban governance studies by applying insights from studies on the coordination of public organisations to the city context. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.",(domestic) city organisations; coordination; governance; integration; Vienna,"Leixnering S., Meyer R.E., Polzer T.",10.1177/0042098020963854
157,5.0,2018,Article,Welcome city: Refugees in three German cities,"Since late 2015, the authors have studied the refugee crisis in Europe. In this article, we analyze local factors that are significant for urban planning to include in an integration plan through case studies in three cities in Germany. We have chosen to study Germany because of the country’s touted Willkommen Kultur (welcome culture), which was prompted in large part by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s “Flüchtlinge Willkommen” (“refugees welcome”) stance. Now, three years after Chancellor Merkel’s declaration to the world, although international and national policies set many parameters for refugee integration, responses to the uncertainty of the situation are fundamentally informed by local contexts. Germany has adopted a policy of distributing refugees to communities throughout the country according to the so-called “Königstein Key”, which sets quotas for each state according to economic capacity. We have selected case study cities and a county that are at different scales and regions: Borken in Hessen (13,500 people), Kassel County (200,000), and Essen, a larger city (600,000). Here we investigate the ways in which German citizens and refugees interact and integrate, with a focus on the social-spatial aspects of refugee experiences and the impacts on urban planning policy, urban morphology, building typology, and pattern language formation. Beyond crisis, we are looking at how refugees can and will try to integrate into their host countries, cities, and neighborhoods and start a new life and how host communities respond to refugee arrival. Urban architecture projects for housing and work opportunities that help the process of integration are part of this study. Particularly, in this article, we investigate the reality on the ground of the positive Willkommen Kultur and the high expectations and implied promises that were set in 2015 by Chancellor Angela Merkel and German society. © 2018 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",Building projects; Pattern language; Refugee acclimatization; Urban design; Urban transformation; Welcome city; Welcome culture,"Neis H.J., Meier B., Furukawazono T.",10.17645/up.v3i4.1668
158,5.0,2018,Conference Paper,«Smart settlements»: The development concept in a new socio-economic and informatiologic conditions,"Strengthen the ties between rural and urban areas is very important for sustainable development: because «Smart Villages» cannot develop in isolation, they should be included in development strategy of regions and territories. In accordance with «Smart Settlement» concept, the existing rural settlements should be not only a place of living: settlements require the improvement of social, pipeline and utility infrastructure, creation vacancies and new business models needed to the integration with the city. The rural settlements potential is not only in social decisions (climate change, food security, etc.), but also in providing employment and investment in rural areas (culture and tourism). The purpose of research is determining the principles of functional-planning settlements organization in compliance with «Smart City» concept. The paper defines the «Smart settlement» idea as a new concept of developing urban/rural settlements and surroundings. The main components of «Smart Settlement» were selected, such as Smart Economy, Smart People, Smart Mobility, Smart Environment, Smart Government and Smart Living.

159,5.0,2017,Conference Paper,Review on the Traditional Uses and Potential of Totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) as Construction Material,"The recent advances in the wood construction field have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall buildings structures and other constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in CO2eq emissions of the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials like concrete or steel, with wood and biomass-based materials. Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO2eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Hidalgo-Cordero J.F., García-Navarro J.",10.1088/1757-899X/245/2/022068
161,5.0,2016,Conference Paper,Applying social norms to high-fidelity pedestrian and traffic simulations,"Smart cities are founded on complex interactions among architectural and urban designs, sensors, actuators and crowds of people with their devices. In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement. In order to allow for a more effective participation of humans in the simulation, our approach does not use central coordinators or coordination protocol, but rather each agent takes its own decision so to make more realistic interactions. A software architecture and initial experimental results are presented and discussed. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Robol M., Giorgini P., Busetta P.",10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580808

163,5.0,2013,Book,The Gateway Arch: A biography,"Rising to a triumphant height of 630 feet, the Gateway Arch in St. Louis is a revered monument to America's western expansion. Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid-1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world's most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition, greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay. Campbell dispels long-held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize-winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision. As a national symbol, the Gateway Arch has a singular place in American culture, Campbell concludes, yet it also stands as an instructive example of failed urban planning. © 2013 by Tracy Campbell.

Developing Guidelines for Human-centered Outdoor Spaces in China that Citizens Can be Proud of,"Creating livable cities through cultural development is important not only because of the inherent value of culture itself, but also because of the social, economic, and environmental benefits afforded by communities with increased pride and attachment to places and people they share the city with. This is increasingly more critical for children and young people, as educating them to become better citizens, it also do strongly relate with development habits and their awareness of interacting with outdoor environments surrounding them. For inhabitants of cities to live an enriched life in every means, they require more than just the infrastructure and the trappings of material wealth: They require an attachment to a place, a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose, of which, a sound cultural development can help generate. Given the central government's recent emphasis in the 13th 5-year plan on encouraging creative and innovative industries, it is relevant to generate programs on cultural development focusing on younger generations. Through this, municipal governments can improve the quality of life and empower the young generation to shape the long-term prosperity of their cities. What are various ways to develop solutions based on strengthening community relations? What are the dynamics of relationship of people with each other from different social milieu?

173,4.0,2014,Article,"Unexplored elasticity of planning and good governance in Harare, Zimbabwe","The state of the city of Harare in terms of its present general outlook and critical analysis of its carrying capacity as a colonial city tends to perpetuate an ingrained myth among urban planners and the common people alike that planning has failed the former so called sunshine-city. Yet such a view treats with amnesia the wealth in the elasticity of planning as an instrument for change as well as a strategic force to command and direct the trajectory of cities. It is in this context that this paper discusses the elasticity of planning of Harare as anchored on a complex but well-knit constellation of the factors of good urban governance and political will. These can allow for urban reform and smart transformation. A close look at the city after 1980 shows that the city of Harare has been subjected to much bickering, contestations and intergovernmental impositions of policy hence it exemplifies policy from above as opposed to policy from below. This is largely explained by the central government's hard and fast wrenching control in directing the affairs of the city hence negating the role of the residents' needs and wants. Recently the city has been facing several challenges, more than ever before, and the more critical challenge now is the adopted culture of colonial blaming rather that solving the deep seated problems of poor management approaches. The present study is skewed towards assessing the historical and contemporary socio-economic and political dynamics as far as they have inspired, championed, ignored, and arm-twisted planning. This has largely been to the detriment of the city. Thus, a vortex and maelstrom over the relevance of planning has been created which now requires planning to exonerate itself by proving its worthiness to the citizens and investors whose creeds and needs it has betrayed over the years. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.",Colonialism; Elasticity; Governance; Spatial planning,"Chirisa I., Kawadza S.T., Muzenda A.",10.14246/irspsd.2.4_19

Public places being the urban stages where the social interactions happen are considered important parts of cities (Thompson, 2002; Varna, 2009). They can contribute to enhance the quality of life within cities, or contrarily increase isolation and social exclusion (Lo et al., 2003). As a consequence of globalization and the development of global cities, the level of international migration has been growing in the last decades creating a plurality of different cultures in global cities and inspiring in such cities a multicultural nature (O'Byrne, 1997; Short and Kim, 1999; Hawkins, 2006). This created new challenges in urban planning or the management of the coexistence of different people that are having different characteristics that shape their unique identity and needs in the shared spaces (Sandercock, 2004). Ideally, in order to invite a diversity of users, urban outdoor places should provide significant functional and physical qualities, and accessibility to them, which induce the fulfillment of physiological, psychological and social needs (Carr et al., 1992; Jacobs, 1993; Sandholz, 2007). Users' state of comfort as stated by researchers gives a good indication for how successful is the public outdoor places (Rosheidat et al., 2008; Kwong et al., 2009; Aljawabra and Nikolopoulou, 2010). In order to create a successful open space usable by all members of a community, urban designers need to satisfy their comfort needs in its wider meaning according to a variety of different ages, genders and cultural backgrounds (Knez and Thorsson, 2006; Thorsson et al., 2007).

177,4.0,2005,Article,The socio-cultural dimension of housing: Quality in Osogbo Nigeria,"House-form has played a significant role in the socio-cultural adaptation of most people and societies in Nigeria. Specifically, within the Yoruba ethnic group of south-western part of Nigeria. To them, the house represents a status symbol, which every member of a particular family identifies with. The pattern and form of such dwelling have played vital role in shaping and influencing the lifestyle of the people. The house to them is a place for moral and social formation as well as for physical and psychology reformation. Unfortunately, the effect and infusion of western cultural contact through civilization, technological advancement and the unfolding world order of globalization on majority of African societies and people have created loss of originality in housing forms and patterns as well as loss of cultural values of the people. This paper, which emanated from a previous resear ch by the Authors, intends to evaluate the significance of house- forms on housing quality as well as on the lifestyle of the Nigeria people. Osogbo, a traditional as well as an urbanized township was used as case study. (The findings of the research are representative of the Housing situation in most Nigerian societies). The study, which identified three (3) zones of res idential and urban development revealed a significant relationship between House-form and Housing quality within the residential districts of Osogbo. It also affirmed the predominance of the Yoruba ethnic origin over other ethnic origins in Osogbo. The paper submitted that any housing planning and de velopment that ignores the relevant socio-cultural forms and patterns would invariably lack originality and relevance to the target population. It, therefore, recommends that Government, housing planners and developers should take house-form of the different sub-cultures into consideration before embarking on future housing development.

There are many issues related to the integration and dialogue between cultures. Urban design plays a key role in how migrants participate in their host community and it is an important driver for the inclusion process. Facilitating the participation of residents in designing public spaces and their use helps to create a better sense of belonging. Promoting in public spaces the interaction of different cultures becomes a crucial element to facilitate social cohesion and living together. The research project explores an innovative approach in the use of public spaces, through the design of smart urban furniture. Based on a survey of the user’s needs, and on co-design activities, the project investigates innovative solutions for facilitating migrants’ integration and the dialogue between different cultures, through the design of innovative urban furniture, with smart technologies embodied inside. The project, based on the co-design approach of rapid prototyping, creates different kinds of new interaction among urban space and people, and between users of different social or cultural background.

Courtney Elizabeth Knapp chronicles the politics of gentrification and culture-based development in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by tracing the roots of racism, spatial segregation, and mainstream ""cosmopolitanism"" back to the earliest encounters between the Cherokee, African Americans, and white settlers. For more than three centuries, Chattanooga has been a site for multiracial interaction and community building; yet today public leaders have simultaneously restricted and appropriated many contributions of working-class communities of color within the city, exacerbating inequality and distrust between neighbors and public officials. Knapp suggests that ""diasporic placemaking""-defined as the everyday practices through which uprooted people create new communities of security and belonging-is a useful analytical frame for understanding how multiracial interactions drive planning and urban development in diverse cities over time. By weaving together archival, ethnographic, and participatory action research techniques, she reveals the political complexities of a city characterized by centuries of ordinary resistance to racial segregation and uneven geographic development. © 2018 The University of North Carolina Press.

182,3.0,2017,Article,An integral lens on Patrick Geddes,"Patrick Geddes is a significant figure in the landscape and urban planning canon. In addition to situating cities within a regional context and advancing a socioecological understanding of urbanization, he viewed cities as the principal artifact of, and theater wherein, human culture evolves. This expansive view of cities may be one of the more challenging aspects of Geddes’ legacy to assimilate. Working during a late 19th and early 20th century period when the limitations of modernity were becoming increasingly apparent, much of Geddes’ aspirational thinking can be seen as an effort to create what he described as a “larger modernism.” In this regard, Geddes can be counted amongst those whom we portray as integrative holistic thinkers, people whose worldview draws them toward meaning-making narratives and frameworks that include the many dimensions of the human condition. Today, a new generation of holistic approaches called “metatheories” – and “integral theory” in particular – provides an orienting lens through which to review, assess, and potentially extend the work of Geddes in the 21st century. Towards that goal, this article first provides an introductory primer to some of Geddes’ noteworthy “thinking machines” as well as integral theory. We then assess correspondence between the two, focusing on Interdisciplinary Holism; Evolution, Development and Complex Systems; Human Agency and Ethics; and Spirituality. A closing discussion addresses prospects for future research, and suggests that the holistic, evolutionary, and generative orientation of our principal subjects may have particular relevance in an anthropogenic biosphere characterized, in part, by significant environmental challenges and the concentration of humans in cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Anthropocene; Anthropogenic biosphere; Cities; Integral theory; Landscape and urban planning; Metatheories; Patrick Geddes; Sociocultural evolution; Socioecological planning; Urbanization,"Eisenman T.S., Murray T.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.011
183,3.0,2017,Article,Eco-development and environmental spatial planning,"Development is directly related to the spatial planning (regional and urban). Nowadays, humanity faces a multidimensional crisis, socio-economic crisis, cultural crisis, which is directly related to the environmental one. In the last few decades, the current development model has been questioned by international organizations and scientists of various specializations. Sustainable development or ecodevelopment approaching interdisciplinary the problem explores the exit from the socio-economic and environmental crisis. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively examine the contents of ecodevelopment and to express it in simple words, so as to be understood by people. In particular, it aims to review and clarify the concept of eco-development, defining its content in its entirety, considering it together with the role of spatial planning (regional and urban) and suggesting methods of organization of society, to provide better quality of life and achieve the exit from the crisis. A need to create a new model based on the concept of ecosystem arises from the research, where the laws of nature and culture of each place will be seriously considered in formulating development policy. A key-element for ecological spatial planning is the carrying capacity of ecosystems. The aim of spatial planning appears to be the sustainability of natural systems in order to be able to sustain and supply the anthropogenic systems, meeting the 'real' human needs. For the implementation of these and the exit from the crisis of utmost importance the role of education is highlighted in creating active citizens, who are required to undertake, through self-organization [1, 2], to promote eco-development and eco-design. © 2017 PSP.","Eco-development; Environment; Spatial planning (regional, urban)",Lantitsou K.I.,
185,3.0,2016,Article,"Urban survey and planning in twentieth-century Japan: Wajiro Kon's ""Modernology"" and its descendants","Since the nineteenth century, the survey of people's way of life were the basic method to study big cities. Even though the surveys were motivated by social awareness, the result was mainly analyzed by scientific, political and economical interests, and often was devided from the cultural and psychological research of urban phenomena. However, as it is obvious that these are closely integrated, the method and idea of the urban survey reflect the bilateral relationship between perceiving and conceiving urban space. This study will explain how urban surveys transformed and reflected the ideas and interests in urban space and its study in Japan from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1980s. Especially in examining a research named ""Modernology"" by a Japanese architect Wajiro Kon from 1925 to 1930, and the works of later Japanese architects inspiered by ""Modernology"" after 1960s, this study will explain how they tried to create urban studies with cultural identity by conducting surveys and integrating with international theories. ""Modernology""described the emerging urban space and people's way of life in Tokyo, and was often recognized as a method of popular culture. However, Modernology represented critical aspects of social space and encouraged people to be more engaged with it. While modernist architects distanced from urban realities to solve its problems scientifically, Modernology was often recognized as their counter part. When we recognize its primal objectives and influence on later generation in seeking the social ethos in the dialectical progress with the bilateral approaches between surveying and planning, we can understand the alternative aspect of Japanese urban studies. ©The Author(s) 2016.",anthropology; Christopher Alexander; Design Survey; everyday phenomena; fashion; idea of urban space; Konpeito and Iryuhin Kenkyujo; lifestyle; marketing theory; Modernology; Patrick Geddes; social survey; Street Observation Society; Tokyo; visual description; Wajiro Kon,Kuroishi I.,10.1177/0096144216635151
189,3.0,2014,Article,Gender and urban space: An examination of a small anatolian city [Toplumsal cinsiyet ve kamusal mekan: Bir Anadolu kenti incelemesi],"Public spaces can be defined as places of interaction, social encounter and exchange where groups with different interests converge. Accessible and open to everyone, they are designed for a variety of uses where people can participate in public life. They also contribute to the collective identity of the community as they represent the culture and values of its users. In recent decades, the different ways in which public spaces are used have been the subject of studies from different disciplines including but not limited to anthropology, geography, sociology, architecture, and urban planning. It has been argued that the way in which urban life is lived and experienced changes according to demographics of its users such as age, sex, and social class.In this study, the use of public spaces based on gender differences is analyzed using space syntax methodology. The context of the study is the city center of a small Anatolian town, Balikesir, which is located in western Turkey. The methodology of the study includes a visibility analysis of the historic city center and pedestrian movement observations on the selected locations within this center. The results indicate that male users dominate the city center at all times while the density of women users is much lower, and is even lower than that of teenagers. A major contribution of this study is the finding that there is a discrepancy between the most integrated streets in terms of visibility and the most densely used ones. Given that the users of this small Anatolian town are mostly its residents, this finding suggests that for route-choice decisions,pedestrians utilize prior knowledge and experience of the city center more than the visual information provided to them via the geometry of the space. © 2014, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

The factors that support this point of view are: 1) the ubiquity of the high rise and new town way of life; 2) a shared value system and culture within the new towns that is shaped by and reflected in the architecture and planning of the new towns; 3) the importance of relationships between spaces in the new towns; 4) the ability of the architecture and planning of new towns to adapt to changes within Singaporean society; 5) the acceptance, legitimacy, and identification of the high-rise way of life by Singaporeans.

This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity. © 2020 by the authors.",Ecosystem management; Municipal government; Nature-based solutions; Q-method; Urban forest governance; Urban planning,"Ordóñez C., Kendal D., Threlfall C.G., Hochuli D.F., Davern M., Fuller R.A., van der Ree R., Livesley S.J.",10.3390/f11090963

Urban planning should concentrate on an organic relationship between people and their living spaces. The city is a product of Earth, a fact of nature, man’s method of expression, Mumford writes in his The Culture of Cities (first edition in 1938). This also means that both the designer and the user must have a high degree of creativity in order to design and utilise the built environment. By analysing the definition of the city Mumford examines its changes during history from ancient times to recent planning method. He criticises the most dominant design processes of the 20th century: the functionalist and mechanical urban design. He is an advocate of the organic method in planning and understanding cities. The organic approach requires an active and creative approach as opposed to mere passive reception. This organic approach by Mumford to understanding cities is based on the theory of Kevin A. Lynch. We may distinguish 3 normative ways of city planning theory: (1) the cosmic, (2) the mechanic and (3) the organic model. In my paper I will first apply the onion model of culture developed by Geert Hofstede for the city and its analysis, and also for the appearance of creativity in them. After that I am going to examine the city with a special, architectural based mind map theory: the five elements by Lynch. Lynch suggests that these five elements (paths, edges, districts, nodes, landmarks) create the mental map for readability. Finally, I will investigate a usage of mental map in modern city planning (Le Corbusier) and works on the process of “debabelisation” (Otto Neurath). © 2018 The Author(s).",City planning; Creativity; Hofstede; Lynch; Mental map; Urban design; Visual argumentation,Jász B.,10.3846/cs.2018.6901
207,2.0,2018,Book Chapter,Sustainable social innovations in smart cities: Exploratory analysis of the current global situation applicable to Colombia,"In the current world most of the population is concentrated in urban areas, where people receive their education, work and leisure activities. Therefore, many challenges have appeared in cities all over the world related to growth, over- population, urban planning, quality of services, competitiveness, environmental factors and citizenship values, which have become main priorities of the managers and mayors of these cities. The Smart City concept emerges as a paradigm that aims to solve these problems and challenges, by developing policies, infrastructure, ser- vices and public awareness programs that will transform today cities, for example a future self-sustaining innovation, growth, technological development, civic and ethical citizenship and social progress. This study presents an exploratory analysis in respect of the current global situation related to the concept of Smart City, com- paring the different essential definitions and dimensions described in recent litera- ture by cited authors and related to the nomenclature of the term. The effects, challenges and opportunities that Smart Cities can offer to their citizens, has been presented, for example in different programs, projects and initiatives, that cities all over the world have implemented, focusing on sustainable social innovations, eco- nomic growth, environmental protection, quality of life, participatory governance, social and community development, citizenship education, efficient urban mobility, tourism services, health and safety. The situation in Bogota and Medellin, the two main cities of Colombia have been reviewed and studied in this work, the aspects previously mentioned have been taken into account to establish a new definition of the Smart City concept. To perform this task, a set of six dimensions and 27 subcat- egories are essential to define and measure this concept in the Colombian paradigm, which can be used to monitor the current status, in order to approximate evaluations of Colombian cities to the qualification concept described as the Smart City. Due to the lack of studies observed in this work, further research must be focused, not only on getting more data from Bogota and Medellin, but also having the opportunity to observe the situation in other important cities such as Barranquilla, Cali, Bucaramanga or Cartagena, currently no data is available. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

208,2.0,2018,Conference Paper,The Development of a Web-Based Urban Soundscape Evaluation System,"Acoustic quality is one of the important aspects of urban design. It is usually evaluated based on how loud the urban environment is. However, this approach does not consider people's perception of the urban acoustic environment. Therefore, a different method has been developed based on the perception of the acoustic environment using the concept of soundscape. Soundscape is defined as the acoustic environment perceived by people who are part of the environment. This approach considers the relationship between the sound source, the environment, and the people. The analysis of soundscape considers many aspects such as cultural aspects, people's expectations, people's experience of space, and social aspects. Soundscape affects many aspects of human life such as culture, health, and the quality of life. Urban soundscape management and planning must be integrated with the other aspect of urban design, both in the design and the improvement stages. The soundscape concept seeks to make the acoustic environment as pleasant as possible in a space with or without uncomfortable sound sources. Soundscape planning includes the design of physical features to achieve a positive perceptual outcome. It is vital to gather data regarding the relationship between humans and the components of a soundscape, e.g., sound sources, features of the physical environment, the functions of a space, and the expectation of the sound source. The data can be measured and gathered using several soundscape evaluation methods. Soundscape evaluation is usually conducted using in-situ surveys and laboratory experiments using a multi-speaker system. Although these methods have been validated and are widely used in soundscape analysis, there are some limitations in the application. The in-situ survey needs to be done at one time with many people at the same time because it is hard to replicate the acoustic environment. Conversely, the laboratory experiment does not have a problem with the repetition of the experiment. This method requires a room with a multi-speaker reproduction system. This project used a different method to analyse soundscape developed using headphones via the internet. The internet system for data gathering has been established; a website has enabled to reproduce high-quality audio and it has a system to design online questionnaires. Furthermore, the development of a virtual reality system allows the reproduction of virtual audio-visual stimulus on a website. Although the website has an established system to gather the required data, the problem is the validation of the reproduction system for soundscape analysis, which needs to be done with consideration of several factors: the suitable recording system, the effect of headphone variation, the calibration of the system, and the perception result from internet-based acoustic environment reproduction. This study aims to develop and validate a web-based urban soundscape evaluation method. By using this method, the experiment can be repeated easily and data can be gathered from many respondents. Furthermore, the simplicity of the system allows for the application by the stakeholders in urban design. The data gathered from this system is important for the design of an urban area with consideration of the acoustic aspects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Sudarsono A.S., Sarwono J.",10.1088/1755-1315/158/1/012052
209,2.0,2018,Article,'Auraldiversity': Defining a hearing- centred perspective to socially equitable design of the built environment,"Historically, sound, soundscape and human hearing have collectively received litt le att ention in the design of urban spaces and places, particularly with regards to the psychological and sociological impact of hearing on the experience of individuals in the built environment. It is proposed that the sonic considerations which have been made in urban design are commonly developed within an assumption of otologically normal hearing, and, more broadly, without the acknowledgement of the actual diversity in people's auditory and sensory abilities. Existing considerations of sound and hearing within inclusive design research, particularly in the built environment, are grounded in an 'auraltypical' perspective where the primary focus is hearing individuals or those with hearing loss. This position supposes to some degree that an idealized otological profi le and consistent model of hearing profi ciency is shared amongst all citizens and engenders a culture of urban design driven by 'good/bad' ears and homogenized sonic interaction. This paper introduces the theoretical paradigm of 'auraldiversity' - an emerging agenda that acknowledges the diversity of human hearing and the multitude of elements that place the hearing modality within a state of constant fl ux. The paper situates this theoretical perspective within the context of the built environment through the mapping of three 'auraldivergent' hearing profi les. Each profi le charts the lived sonic experiences of a d/Deaf or disabled individual in the built environment. The paper concludes by positioning the auraldiversity paradigm as a catalyst in the development of a hearing-centred approach to inclusive design research, a new agenda where the opportunity for more socially and sonically equitable design of the built environment is established. © 2018 Ingenta.",,Renel W.,10.2148/benv.44.1.36
212,2.0,2016,Article,Lewis Mumford's Urbanism and the Problem of Environmental Modernity,"This essay reconsiders the early career of Lewis Mumford and the assumption that modernity has been disastrous environmentally. Might it be possible to see Mumford, especially in his writings of the 1930s, as an early exemplar of green urbanism? Within environmental history, Mumford has been treated mostly as a regionalist - sometimes even as an opponent of the city. This essay argues that in fact his path toward ecological ""balance"" led directly through the city, not out of it. Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic ""renewal"" but also as a landscape full of what he called ""remnants"" and ""persistents""; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. © 2016 The Author.",,Sachs A.,10.1093/envhis/emw034

Para refers to a spatial connotation with a neighbourhood, but the physical manifestation is not the only pre-requisite to form a para. Para reflects a networked social cohesion as the continuous affection concretely demonstrated in people's decisions about where to live, how to work and with whom to engage in their daily lives. Culture, ethnicity, language, food habit, mutual feelings of belongingness and robust social networking within a neighbourhood contribute to the growth of a para.

It is imperative to harness the latent potential of existing settlements for an inclusive smart urban development. The study aims to assess the socio-cultural attributes of an Indian historic urban landscape with a thriving residential culture. Since data collection of neighborhood-level urban communities is not feasible in India, a structured questionnaire was used to conduct household surveys. Such real-world phenomena have inherent imprecision and ambiguity associated with human judgments. Therefore, the survey items are assumed as fuzzy linguistic variables, and the raw dataset is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy arithmetic and weighted averaging operators are applied for the hierarchical evaluation of indicators and variables. A robust algorithm is used for the dimension reduction of a fuzzy coded dataset while dealing with subjective responses. The aggregated fuzzy scores show an overall better performance of traditional communities with respect to their socio-cultural attributes, such as a sense of safety and collective efficacy. The application of fuzzy logic in urban planning and allied behavioral studies can effectively and pragmatically deal with the inherent uncertainties in a humanistic system.

While the subjectivity view is commonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of subsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion of beauty—structural beauty—among people and even different peoples, regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a physical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based on the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To verify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight pairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock’s Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies that goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an opinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision, architecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and psychology. © 2021 by the authors.

229,1.0,2021,Book Chapter,A study of built morphology and cultural imagery—a case of bengaluru pettah: Historic core of the city,"Cities are composition of complex matrix of neighbourhood held together by the movement networks. The local neighbourhood is very important to understand how people conceive the city in their minds. The representative memory captures the elements related to spatial identity of a place, but more often than not, these representations are pictorial images superimposed upon the fabric resulted from the standardized tools used for analysing the spatial qualities and its attributes. The recognition of the finding to capture elements related to experiences of spatial identity problematizes from well-established urban design spatial theories. On the other hand, Indian city is a collective of people, place and events. These neighbourhoods may not be central to social or business relationships nor centre for historic monuments, but the activities, users, events, location and spatial conditions that support them are very different—together key to the legibility of the city. More often than not, the impacts due to the city’s regeneration process sustain the test of time and manifest into a deeper system for building an image of the place. Hence, embedded meaning and meaningful association over time become crucial for the built morphology. One such neighbourhood is Pettah1—the old core of city of Bangalore. Bengaluru was one of the key trading centres of the south during the pre-colonial era. The idea of a town structured around Pettah (market), Kote2 (fort), Kere3 (lakes and tanks) and Totha4 (gardens and parks) was an unquestionable matrix of natural occurrences and cultural practices. Decades to follow many influences on to the town added a layer of new structure, and every stage of progress enunciated the past with a new skin of elements. It is this value of city’s memory that lie buried within us carrying forward our past into its present fabric. Hence, the study reveals the need to radically departure from the routines of recording legibility and imageability through mental, sensory and visual mapping and to record in terms of space, events, time, activities as well as sense of public-ness. Ultimately, the findings also brings optimism into urban design practice, offering new insight into how to record mosaic of an area in an Indian city that will capture the strong perceived and conceived imagery of a place and hence sensitive responsive proposals that will aid to carefully conceive a system for the future. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Character; Culture; Elusive; Morphology; Neighbourhood,"Bydar Shubhashchandra S., Subramanian R.R.",10.1007/978-3-030-51961-2_18
230,1.0,2021,Article,Where do you live and what do you drive: Built-environmental and spatial effects on vehicle type choice and vehicle use,"The carbon footprint of daily travel for an individual household is based on the types of vehicles that the household owns, their fuel efficiency, and the number of miles traveled (Federal Highway Administration, 2009). Therefore, the types and usage of vehicles a household owns are informational to overall sustainable planning. This study develops a multinomial logit model for vehicle type choice and a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model for vehicle use for Ohio households using the most recent Household Travel Survey (HTS) collected in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The developed vehicle choice model identifies the effects of the built environment characteristics on vehicle type based on vehicle size, controlling for socio-economic attributes. People residing in neighborhoods characterized with higher densities in population, employment, and intersection and with fewer single detached housing are more likely to own smaller vehicles as compared to the ones living in suburban areas. A good transit accessibility would decrease the probability of owning pickup trucks. The SAR model reveals how the vehicle a household owns is used is still slightly positively associated with his/her neighbour’s vehicle use after controlling for the effects of the built environment and socio-economics. The models will enable decision makers to estimate potential changes in vehicle fleet composition under changing built environment scenarios and neighborhood culture in using private vehicles. Although the model results and estimated coefficients may be different for different urban areas, the methodology is transferable to other communities, locally and nationally. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cluster analysis; multinomial logit; spatial autoregression; vehicle type choice; vehicle use,"Chen N., Akar G., Gordon S.I., Chen S.",10.1080/15568318.2020.1762950

In a European context, Finland urbanized late. This lies at the heart of the common interpretation that Finland lacks an urban culture and urban lifestyles. Today, however, with the new comprehensive Urban Plan, city planners in Helsinki emphasize a paradigm shift towards urbanity. This paper seeks to understand this changing emphasis in planning by exploring how planners frame and understand urbanity.

232,1.0,2020,Article,Resonating the ‘culture’ debate in urban planning,"In this era of rapid urbanisation, an understanding of the role of culture in advancing urban planning and development is important for effective urban management, especially in Africa where the culture of informality is dominant. Yet, there is a dearth of research on the relationship between the culture of informality and urban planning in Africa. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to analyse the influence of the culture of informality on urban planning and development in Kumasi, a rapidly urbanizing city in Ghana; and (ii) to explore how local people perceive and consider their culture of informality in the context of urban planning as a tool for development. Using mixed methods research approach (surveys, agency interviews, document review, and participant observation), findings indicate that four out of five identified values of the culture of informality have statistically significant positive influence on urban planning and development. However, there is institutional neglect of the culture of informality in urban planning due to limited understanding of the relevance of informality in urban development, contributing to environmental and socio-economic challenges (e.g., slums proliferation, extinction of green spaces). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Culture; Informality; Kumasi; Urban development; Urban planning; Urbanisation,"Cobbinah P.B., Asibey M.O., Gyau N.B.",10.1016/j.ccs.2020.100369
233,1.0,2020,Conference Paper,"Monitoring of electrical consumption, including self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic","To date, one of the most relevant tasks is a justified calculation of the electrical capacity of residential buildings and public facilities. Studies conducted by the 'Roselectromontazh' Association have shown a significant difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity, which is further confirmed by the reports of electric grid companies. In some cases, there is a 3-fold difference. This occurs due to the emergence of a sustainable culture of electricity consumption and the use of highly energy-efficient devices. In 2019, the results of the research work were taken into account in the regional urban planning standards of the Republic of Tatarstan. On average, the normative values have been reduced by 2 times. This enabled a significant reduction in the difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity. From 2020 onwards, leading construction companies in the Republic of Tatarstan are applying up-to-date values to decrease utility services' construction costs. For power grid companies the savings consist of reduction of electrical energy losses and 'locked electrical capacity' and the elimination of inefficient investments. It is important to note that specific values of electrical load were calculated taking into account summer and winter peaks in order to exclude the emergencies. However, it was impossible to predict a time when people would need to stay self-isolated at home to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019).

234,1.0,2020,Article,Urban cohesion vis-à-vis organic spatialization of “Third places” in Saudi Arabia: The need for an alternative planning praxis,"Many medium-sized middle-eastern cities like Khobar in Saudi Arabia have become a popular destination for predominantly low-to semi-skilled expatriate workers from several South and South East Asian countries. The social spatialization of these working class people has been manifested in compartmentalized public spaces as specific ethnic oriented “third places”, such as Filipino markets, Bangladeshi bazaar, and Pakistani neighborhood. Yet, there is no research scholarship available on the nature and type of such third places and their importance and influences on plan making process in the middle-eastern context. Certain (re-)defining themes, notably expressing and celebrating everyday culture, feeling of home being away from home, sense of places, and center places for socialization and integration emerge to brand these places as we explored empirical evidence with grounded theory centered socio-cultural lenses. Additionally, exploring spatio-temporal permeability of these third places using Space Syntax accessibility model helped us to draw critical insights about how such lessons and practices can challenge the contemporary city planning and design practices. Critical planning interventions like collaborative governance of third places as proposed here can be adopted in making cities like Khobar cohesive. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Collaborative governance; Public space; Space Syntax; Spatialization; Third place; Urban cohesion,"Nahiduzzaman K.M., Aldosary A., Ahmed S., Hewage K., Sadiq R.",10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102258
235,1.0,2020,Book,Youth culture and identity in northern thailand: Fitting in and sticking out,"Youth Culture and Identity in Northern Thailand examines how young people in urban Chiang Mai construct an identity at the intersection of global capitalism, state ideologies, and local culture. Drawing on over 15 years of ethnographic research, the book explores the impact of rapid urbanisation and modernisation on contemporary Thai youth, focusing on conspicuous youth subcultures, drug use (especially methamphetamine use), and violent youth gangs. Anjalee Cohen shows how young Thai people construct a specific youth identity through consumerism and symbolic boundaries – in particular through enduring rural/urban distinctions. The suggestion is that the formation of subcultures and “deviant” youth practices, such as drug use and violence, are not necessarily forms of resistance against the dominant culture, nor a pathological response to dramatic social change, as typically understood in academic and public discourse. Rather, Cohen argues that such practices are attempts to “fit in and stick out” in an anonymous urban environment. This volume is relevant to scholars in Thai Studies, Southeast Asian Studies, Anthropology, Sociology, Urban Studies, and Development Studies, particularly those with an interest in youth, drugs, and gangs. © 2020 Anjalee Cohen.",,Cohen A.,10.4324/9781351127745
240,1.0,2018,Book,From urban national parks to natured cities in the global south: The quest for naturbanity,"This important volume focuses on the sensitive issue of interrelationships between national parks situated near or within urban areas and their urban environment. It engages with both urban and conservation issues and and compares four national parks located in four large cities in the global South: Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Mumbai, and Nairobi. Though primarily undertaken as academic research, the project has intensively collaborated with the institutions in charge of these parks. The comparative structure of this volume is also original and unique: each of the chapters incorporates insight from all four sites as far as possible.The term ""naturbanity"" expresses the necessity for cities endowed with a national park to integrate it into their functioning. Conversely, such parks must take into account their location in an urban environment, both as a source of heavy pressures on nature and as a nexus of incentives to support their conservation. The principle of non-exclusivity, that is, neither the city nor the park has a right nor even the possibility to negate the other's presence, summarizes the main argument of this book. Naturbanity thus blurs the old ""modern"" dichotomy of nature/culture: animals and human beings can often jump the physical and ideological walls separating many parks from the adjacent city. The 13 chapters and substantive introduction of this volume discuss various aspects of naturbanity: the histories of park creation; interaction between people and parks; urban governance and parks; urban conservation models; wildlife management; environmental education; and so on. This is a must-read for students and researchers interested in social ecology, social geography, conservation, urban planning and ecological policy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

243,1.0,2017,Conference Paper,Use of Daylight and Aesthetic Image of Glass Facades in Contemporary Buildings,"The paper deals with the architecture of contemporary buildings in respect to their aesthetic image created by the use of natural light. Sustainability is regarded as a governing principle of contemporary architecture, where daylighting is an important factor as it affects energy consumption and environmental quality of the space inside a building. Environmental awareness of architecture, however, involves a much wider and more holistic view of design. The quality of sustainable architecture can be considered in its aesthetic and cultural context with regard to landscape, local tradition, and connection to the surrounding world. This approach is associated with the social mission of architecture, i.e. providing appropriate space for living, facilitating social relations and having positive impact on people. The purpose of the research is to study the use of daylight in creating an aesthetic image of contemporary buildings. The author focuses mainly on public buildings largely dedicated to art and culture which satisfy high functional and aesthetic requirements. The paper examines the genesis and current trends in the aesthetic image of modern buildings which use daylight as the main design strategy, focusing on the issues of glass facades. The main attention is given to the shaping of representative public areas which feature the glass facades. The research has been based on a case study, critical review of literature review, observation and synthesis. The study identifies and classifies different approaches to using daylight in these areas and highlights changes in the aesthetics of architecture made of glass, which uses daylight as the main design strategy. These changes are primarily caused by the development and spreading of new glazing materials and the use of digital method of design. The influence of light and its mode depends on glass materials but also on the local conditions of the site, and has a significant impact on the relationship between architecture and its natural and cultural environment. The subordination of architectural concept to the idea of natural lighting builds the relationship between form, function and the context of architecture, and is expressed in its structural, material and spatial properties, and in the resulting aesthetic order. Search for new architectural solutions is defined by local topographical, climatic, biological and cultural conditions. The architecture subordinate to the conception of contribution of light corresponds to the aesthetic aspirations of sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Roginska-Niesluchowska M.,10.1088/1757-899X/245/8/082035
245,1.0,2017,Review,"'This place has potential': Trash, culture, and urban regeneration in Tallinn, Estonia","The article analyses the use of cultural programmes and trash as tools for urban speculation in Tallinn, Estonia, naturalising an urban strategy that entails extensive spatial revaluation and socioeconomic intervention. Through an anthropological perspective focused on concepts of potential and trash, the analysis shows how the central-north shoreline was mobilised discursively as a wasteland and a zone of unrealised potential to justify capitalist development of the area. The way it was framed, both moving towards completion and as a playground for cultural activities and young people, increased the value and accessibility of the area, but also allowed real estate developers to exploit the synergies generated and make profit from the revaluated plots. Tropes of potential and trash appear thus as discursive tools for urban regeneration, co-related with a formal allocation of resources and official permits. As the case study shows, when an area is classed as having 'potential', it becomes defined by the fulfilment of that restrictive conceptualisation, which allows the economy to dictate urban planning and also cultural policy. © 2017 Finnish Anthropological Society.

Beyoğlu represents the modern culture and way of life that arose from Istanbul’s relationship with European countries; first, it began as a respectable neighborhood and from there modernization spread to the rest of the city. After the 1970s, the construction of the Bosphorus Bridge and the city’s ring roads, the multi-center development of the city and the abandonment of the old city center by higher and middle income people have caused the decline of the old city center. In 1986, the pedestrianization of İstiklal Caddesi was proposed as a means to revitalize the neighborhood. After the implementation of the project, there was a rapid increase in land values, which is still continuing. As a result of this, the restoration of historic buildings has accelerated and the area has become a focal point of domestic and foreign investment. The manufacturing and storage areas have been turned into hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, cultural centers, bookstores, galleries and music shops. Pedestrian flow is very high in this area, and the revitalization project is regarded as one of the most successful in the world. For this study, the factors which produce increases in land values have been analyzed by means of a regression analysis. According to the results, the relationship between the land values and the distance to Taksim square was negative. © 2017, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

More generally, it intends to explore how the internal history produced by specific fields of activity, such as architecture or urbanism, can reinforce the logic of a national and nationalized history. This effect is due partly to the fact that the legitimacy of these fields is largely dependent on the national identification in the context of activities that are internationalized. I will argue that the specific field of activity, while creating this internal discourse, can directly or indirectly produce representations of the nation, its history and its people on a larger scale, penetrating popular culture and influencing a shared common sense. In the case in question, the internal discourse on architectural and urbanistic works, on authors and styles, eventually reinforces an idealized and idyllic image of Portuguese colonialism. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Dossier.",Architecture; Modernization; Portuguese colonialism; Representation memory; Urban planning,Domingos N.,10.1386/pjss.14.3.235_1

254,1.0,2009,Book Chapter,Staying too long at the fair: Philadelphia planning and the debacle of 1976,"In 1682, 1776, or 1876, the optimism of Edmund Bacon's remarkable 1959 vision for Philadelphia's future-""Philadelphia in the Year 2009""-would have surprised no one. From its founding, Philadelphia's unfolding futures were consistently dynamic, focusing the energies of colonial expansion, democratic governance, and industrialization in one urban crucible. No other city in America exhibited each trend so dramatically. It was the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876- with the glass and steel dome of its Memorial Hall, its displays of telegraphy and the telephone, its prototype steam automobiles-that first demonstrated to Americans what an industrialized nation might really look like. Ed Bacon was an enthusiast of world's fairs and public exhibitions, writing and speaking of them throughout his career to illustrate and promote trends in urban development, and working in the genre himself to advance a far-reaching planning agenda for Philadelphia in the postwar decades. Philadelphia emerged from World War II burdened by creaking infrastructure and a housing shortage, its Center City business district underperforming against rival cities. Deindustrialization was already noticeable by the mid-1950s, an emerging economic reality that foretold difficulty in achieving the social goals of a new and aggressive generation of reform-minded political leadership.1 Residents were embarking for the suburbs at a steady clip, with the city falling by 1960 from third to fourth in population behind Los Angeles.2 Bacon's 50-year vision projected against this backdrop might have struck the reader as cheerful but unrealistic, even naïve. But what good is a prophecy if it does not reveal a hidden future, a future obstructed? Bacon's future was a city revitalized, beautified, and modernized in time to host the nation's Bicentennial celebration and a simultaneous 1976 Philadelphia World's Fair. Imaginative planning was his method, enabling the political gatekeepers along with the citizens of the city to see with him decades ahead and to grasp the occasion of a fair to accomplish lasting change for the city's built environment and its people. ""Philadelphia in the Year 2009"" builds its case on this one powerful idea: A world's fair could transform it into a model of humane urbanism.3 Considering his vantage point in 1959, it is possible to imagine why Ed Bacon might predict the future of Philadelphia with such mesmerizing flourishes. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC), under his directorship, was in the midst of one of the longest winning streaks any urban planning body had or has ever achieved. With Penn Center, Society Hill, Independence Mall, the neighborhoods of Eastwick and the Far Northeast each underway or finished, Bacon and his team of young planners were totally in their stride in 1959, working to think, dig, and build the city out of its rut. The Market East transportation center, a pedestrian-friendly Chestnut Street, and a tourist-friendly Delaware waterfront were all on Bacon's drawing board, too. These were the varied pieces, described in turn by each of the authors in this volume, of a full urban-renewal portfolio advanced consistently over more than two decades by the PCPC. Postwar federal legislation enabled city officials for the first time to broadly exercise eminent domain powers, moving masses of residents and bulldozing whole sections of the city, planning and building anew.4 Ed Bacon's PCPC was certainly of its time in this respect and forceful in its place, stirring up both wonder and backlash. The old industrial city, the city that had lain fallow through the Depression and World War II, was awakening slowly to the possibility of highrises and integrated transportation hubs, and at the same time rediscovering its walkable character and the vernacular beauties of its historic neighborhoods. Bacon's idea was to liberate William Penn's grid from over a century of industrial-age clutter and to make the city simultaneously auto-, pedestrian-, and investment-friendly. Bacon understood the power of display and salesmanship as keys to making his idea of the next Philadelphia into something tangible. In this spirit, his ""2009"" essay arrived on newsstands in 1959. Could new high-rises and a suburban-style shopping center downtown reverse massive job losses and a suburban exodus? Whether the PCPC's projects were comprehensive enough remained an open question in 1959. In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The ""2009"" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's ""2009"" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the ""master planner"" and by extension New Deal/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian ""Philadelphia in the Year 2009."".

256,1.0,2007,Article,Residential environment evaluation system considering environmental quality and environmental load for sustainable development of residential district (part I): Residential environment quality,"Residential environment is one of the most important elements for the quality of life, as well as the main support for the activities of economy, culture and society. However, the improvement of residential environmental quality also has been increasing the consumption of energy and the emission of pollutants. First, a systematic methodology for the evaluation of sustainable residential environment is established, considering both the residential environmental quality (Q) and the residential environmental load (L). The part of Q is constructed by safety, health, amenity, convenience and community of residential environment. The part of L is about the environmental impact of the lifecycle of housing and community. Then, the region of Yangtze River Delta of China is selected as the research area, because it is the most highly-growing area of China and gives great influence on other cities. As the first part of the research, the authors performed questionnaire surveys in Hangzhou and Shanghai focusing on the residential environmental quality (Q), and analyzed the residential environmental satisfaction of people. In the next step, the study on the index part of environmental load (L) will be performed, and the weight of each factor will be determined.

258,1.0,2006,Book Chapter,The 1876 centennial in Philadelphia: Elite networks and political culture,"AT NOON on May 10, 1876-after years of controversy, construction, and fuss-President Ulysses S. Grant and Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil entered Machinery Hall to open the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Since early morning, the day's 186,000 attendees had been streaming through the gates. The president and the emperor stood in front of thirteen acres of motionless machinery, all connected by pulleys, shafts, wheels and belts to the giant Corliss engine in the central transept. Several hundred invited guests, already waiting there, made room for the ceremonial party to climb upon the concrete base of the huge metal monster towering forty feet above their heads almost to the trussed roof of the Hall. Machinery Hall was one of five major buildings put up by exhibition organizers in Fairmount Park; outside groups built dozens more. The Main Building was the largest in the world at the time-over a third of a mile long. Visitors marveled at the items on display: A typewriter, Hires root beer, the Statue of Liberty's torch, the Westinghouse air brake, Fleischmann's yeast, cable from the Brooklyn Bridge, Bell's telephone, and Otis's elevator.2 The Centennial was a resounding success, dramatically displaying Philadelphia's wealth and industrial might. Over nine million people-nearly one-fifth of the country's population-attended before its close in November. It was the first international exposition held in the United States and probably the single most important cultural event of its era. Foreigners flocked to Philadelphia-inaugurating mass tourism to the United States-to see American industrial innovations and dozens of foreign exhibits from Britain, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Japan, China, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and ""two large Arab tents."" This influx of visitors and national cultures also opened Philadelphia andthe United States to a world of new influences; the Japanese exhibit in particular stirred an Oriental design fashion in the United States.3 Beyond the pomp, the fanfare, the hotel receipts, and the visitors, the Centennial also helped restructure the city's politics. The event both cemented networks of alliances among previously divided elites and marked the ascendance of a Republican hegemony in local political culture that would be virtually unchallenged for the next sixty years. The Republican regime that coalesced in the 1870s combined several elements: party bossism centered in control of several city agencies, an electoral machine that came to trade votes for public construction contracts, business support based in ideological solidarity (support for protectionist legislation), and reliance on rail- And port-related industries as the engine of the city's economy. In Philadelphia's case, the irony is that those Republicans who did the most to make the Centennial happen-large, reformist civic organizations like the Union League that played crucial roles in event planning and in promoting commitment to the Republican Party-did not necessarily enjoy the political fruits of their labors. Over time, the elite's cultural and ideological commitment to Republicanism became a straitjacket, and they lost control of the polity they had helped build. More broadly, I use the example of the Centennial to examine the role that cultural projects play in urban governance. These projects, and the planning efforts that produce them, contribute to the emergence and consolidation of governing regimes out of situations of extreme political discord and fragmentation. They connect processes of elite network formation (social capital) and ideological consolidation. These two processes in turn are the building blocks of hegemony in local governance-cultural and social leadership that shapes people's political commitments and the extent to which they are willing to consider or pursue alternatives to prevailing arrangements. © 2006 by Temple University Press.

260,1.0,2006,Editorial,The World Urban Forum III: Vancouver,"""Better information for better cities!"" is the call that leads this special issue. Urban indicators and performance measurement are the answers, aiming to improve local performance on key trends and contribute to solving global problems. Better information, according to the rational model that predominates in urban policy, is the surest path to improve action. The World Urban Forum (WUF) III, meeting in Vancouver in June 2006, considers dimensions, challenges, and practices in the use of urban indicators in the Vancouver region. Patrick Geddes, writing in the early days of the town and regional planning movement, insisted upon the value of what he called a synoptic view, ""a seeing of the city and this as a whole; like Athens from its Acropolis"" (Geddes, 1949, p. 6). Working from a synoptic view did not simply mean gazing down on the city from atop a hill. Geddes strove to help people express ""simultaneity"" of their own being. Understanding that people living in a given region have a multitude of different perspectives, simultaneity of being meant ""one-ness with the social ideals, the scientific developments and the physical conditions of [their] own time and place"" (Geddes, 1949, p. x). He believed a region could be created and planned to aid people in accomplishing all these things. As one of the forefathers of town and regional planning, Geddes himself was a maker of ""great maps and diagrams and charts"" (Geddes, 1949, p. xiii)-but his most lasting contribution to the profession and practice of planning was his notion of the Civic Exhibition. Geddes was less concerned about expert training to make great plans and planners than he was ""concerned that the ordinary citizen should have a vision and a comprehension of the possibilities of his own city"" (Geddes, 1949, p. xi). A periodic Civic Exhibition, during which citizens could gather in a festive atmosphere to peruse plans, gaze at large maps and models, discuss and interpret these publicly, was one part of Geddes's key contribution to this goal. The other part was his drive to create a permanent and public centre for Civic Studies in every town in the form of an ""Outlook Tower""(Geddes, 1949, p. xi). The Outlook Tower was to be the ""incipient Civic Observatory and Laboratory together"" in which the Science of Cities was advanced to its proper rank amongst academic and life pursuits (Geddes, 1949, p. 96). The institution Geddes sought to create placed ""its effort towards correlation of thought and action, science and practice, sociology and morals, with its watchword and endeavour of ""Civic Survey for Civic Service"""" (Geddes, 1949, p. 69). Fastforward to late 2004, when the Urban Studies Program at Simon Fraser University's downtown campus initiated the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu), with a vision akin to that of Geddes. In the context of the new millennium, RVu was established as the first local observatory within UN-Habitat's Global Urban Observatory network in a developed country. The Global Urban Observatory was established in 1997 to institutionalize UN-Habitat's pioneering work in the generation and tracking of urban indicators, initiated with the Urban Indicators Programme in 1993. Following the creation of the Habitat Agenda at the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul in 1996, the mission was set for the Global Urban Observatory-to create and maintain a Global Urban Indicators Database that would permit UN member states and their cities to monitor and report on urban trends on a regular and reliable basis. The Millennium Development Goals, established by UN member states in 2000, and the indicators established for tracking these eight goals in 2003, update the mission of the Global Urban Indicators Database (UN-Habitat 2004). The MDGs represent a global compact for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, to be attained by 2015. RVu's work to date is being presented to the international community for the first time at the World Urban Forum III. The work thus far has constituted both expert-based and public participatory components. Experts affiliated with RVu have conducted regional and international research on urban indicator-related work, with some bearing on the Vancouver region and on specific indicators used by a range of projects in the major areas of urban capital: health, economy, environment, governance, culture, and infrastructure. Work in progress toward these research articles was presented at the first RVu public event, Focusing ouR View, in October 2005; and the best finished results are presented in this issue of Cities. Keys to the design of Rvu, and in particular its public participatory process, are presented in the first article in this issue, Urban Indicators and the Integrative Ideals of Cities, by Meg Holden. The paper presents the practice in progress of RVu's stance on urban sustainability as a community-based struggle to learn, indicators as a means for long-term learning, and the role of value-based citizen participation, within a theoretical perspective. Sustainable development, as a framework for long-term planning, has value in the Vancouver region for its ""constructive ambiguity""(Robinson, 2004, p. 374), its pointers toward greater linkages among environmental, social, and economic priorities, without forcing a premature set of quantitative trade-offs. This integrative, vague, idealistic thrust also leaves sustainable development open to clashes with incremental, specific, and realist demands competing for time on the public agenda. Indicators can help bridge the gap; the articles in this issue begin to explain how. One article presents a bridge from the perspective of environmental economics, illustrating the complexities of measuring natural capital but also the need and precedent for this. The next article presents a way of thinking about indicators of governance for sustainable development from a starting point of allocating equal value to democratic inclusion of each citizen. Moving from the individual to the group, the final two articles ask for greater attention to socially, culturally and demographically-specific cases: new immigrants and Aboriginal people. Nancy Olewiler offers an economist's perspective on the design and utility of an urban indicator project, with a particular focus on natural capital. Her article, Environmental Sustainability for Urban Areas: The Role of Natural Capital Indicators, expands on one of the themes from Holden, the difference between descriptive indicators, which proliferate in policy contexts, and diagnostic indicators, which are rare. Olewiler presents the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and reminds us of the need to consider different indicators at each point in the chain. Her treatment of natural capital indicator issues locally includes useful information on Greater Vancouver's adjacent Fraser Valley Regional District. She looks south to the city of Santa Monica, California for an example of natural capital indicator development and institutionalization. Building on a theme introduced by Holden, Olewiler reminds us that indicators alone are not enough; effective indicators are those presented in a reasoned context with a clear path to actions. Indicators belong at the beginning, not the end, of a good governance process. The next article specifies much more clearly what might be meant by the notion of good governance. In Designing Good Urban Governance Indicators: The Importance of Citizen Participation and its Evaluation in Greater Vancouver, political scientist Kennedy Stewart makes the case for inclusion of governance considerations in any definition of sustainability. The political aspect of sustainability is poorly developed, compared to economic, environmental, and social aspects and this article moves the thinking ahead through treatment of democratic theory, along with work on defining 'good governance' advanced by the United Nations. Stewart draws on evidence of voting patterns in the Vancouver region to raise the spectre of systematic disenfranchisement, that seems to be on the rise. As Canada's only unamalgamated major metropolitan region, led by municipal appointments rather than direct elections, advances in sustainable development policy made by the Greater Vancouver Regional District are at risk if voting trends cannot be reversed. Stewart calls for stepwise moral reasoning, based on the premise of universal equal rights to rectify this wrong. The final two articles examine the limits of belonging to the project of sustainability in the Vancouver region, from the perspective of the region's newest residents and its ancestral residents. Robert Fiedler, Nadine Schuurman and Jennifer Hyndman, in Hidden Homelessness: An Indicator - Based Approach for Examining the Geographies of Recent Immigrants At-Risk of Homelessness in Greater Vancouver, focus on the dimensions of risk of homelessness amongst one particularly vulnerable group, new immigrants. This investigation brings to the fore the interaction of policies, economics, and cultures in explaining the complexities of homelessness and immigration trends in the region. Since about half of the region's population growth in the foreseeable future will come from international immigration, and an increasing proportion of new arrivals face socio-economic difficulties upon arrival, understanding these interactions is key to sustainability in a context of increasing cultural diversity and decreasing affordability of housing. First Nations researcher Nathan Cardinal puts an Aboriginal lens on indicators in his concluding article, The Exclusive City: Identifying, Measuring and Drawing Attention to Aboriginal and Indigenous Experiences in an Urban Context. Along with immigrants, Aboriginal groups constitute fast growing demographic cultural groups in British Columbia.",,Holden M.,10.1016/j.cities.2006.03.002

She states that organic sounds created by humans and animals that have always accompanied human civilization helps to understand it. But as the city noise rose with urbanization, people started escaping it. Organizations and commissions were formed to control city noise and to provide a noise-free environment. Modern architects of America constructed the Philadelphia Saving fund Society in 1932 to control sound by acoustically isolating people from the city noise. The modern solution was achieved to the problem of noise by turning buildings into placeless artifacts thereby defying their location in the world.",,Thompson E.,
263,1.0,2002,Conference Paper,Designing a DNA for adaptive architecture: A new built environment for social sustainability,"The paper explores innovative environmentally responsible and socially proactive ways to build in developing countries. The proposed methodology was tested with the design of a Smart Village in Egypt, awarded the second prize in an international competition. Our design approach is based on environmental and social sustainability and works as a genetic algorithm. This process generates the sustainable architecture of the village using the behaviour of biological creatures in artificial systems. The design ultimately ensures that our architecture is nurtured by renewable energies and built with re-cycled materials. The disposition of public spaces and the flexible organization of different functions are conceived in order to stimulate social sustainability, allowing the community to be interdependent as much as an ecosystem. Local cultures, typologies, materials and climate build the DNA of both the village and its buildings. We apply concepts from artificial life, using ""creatures"" that follow simple low-level rules in order to get high-level group behaviour. By combining the principles of artificial life and architecture, we get both high energy-efficiency and optimal placement of built units on a specific site. As in any ecosystem, a fractal, coherent, continuous fluctuation at every scale of the system is vital, and this kinetic flexibility is achieved at four levels: 1) decentralized urban planning; 2) reconfigurable spaces; 3) modular building blocks; 4) kinetic structures that respond to light, climate and people.",,"Magnoli G.C., Bonanni L.A., Khalaf R.",
265,1.0,1991,Article,The Delhis within Delhi,"Concepts and techniques of human settlements cannot be divided from social and economic realities in which they are located. One of the most important factors is the development of the historical forces. This is shown in the case of Delhi. Today, Delhi is not one single city anymore. Apart from the complexity that all similarly sized urban areas show there are many districts with their unique background, character, personality and culture. To improve living conditions in the old areas of the city, while still retaining their character, the ""conservative surgery' approach may be adopted, rather than extensive re-development schemes. The people for which shelter is designed must be met with confidence and their real participation must be sought. For achieving all this, planning has first to start from outside Delhi, and the National Capital Region plan, the recommendations of the National Commission of Urbanization, and the National Housing Policy all have an impact. In the foreseeable future, Delhi is going to be a city of flats. Maybe this is the only workable solution. To achieve culturally the best results, this kind of development should preferably be done through co-operatives rather than government offices. -from Author",,Chandhoke K.,
266,1.0,1983,Article,MINIMIZING ENERGY DEMANDS IN MEDIUM SIZE CITIES: GLOBAL PROSPECTS.,"Increasing the role of medium size cities is important for future development because: decentralizing urbanization helps reduce pressure on decaying metropolises; they are where people still live in developing countries, and increasingly prefer to live in advanced countries; total economic requirements for infrastructure developments may be lower than that of larger cities; and in general, medium size cities appear to be more manageable for both administrators and residents. Case studies of medium size cities suggest that they also suffer from uncontrolled growth and energy intensive development patterns. On the other hand, aspects of these cities provide examples of efficient development patterns which appear conceptually adaptable to emerging needs. In this paper it is suggested that many of the city patterns in developing countries have evolved to suit conditions of local culture, climate and geographical resources, and provide fruitful ground to derive solutions for future development in both developing and developed countries.",,Gami Bharat M.,
267,,2021,Article,"Neoliberal urban sustainability in Old Kolkata, India: Case studies of contested developments","Neoliberalism, a contemporary form of liberalism, advocates supremacy of market economic valuation in the social choices and decisions. Expectedly the neoliberal political-economic compulsions have opened up scope for capitalistic investment in the city of Kolkata. But, due to lack of decentralized urban facilities and a typical outlook of the people to stay in the “core” area, construction of high-rise buildings replacing the traditional structures and associated cultures in the old and heritage areas is prominent. Cost of living in the urban core has been increasing rapidly due to the advent of the affluent families, having more purchasing power parity; and thus, the people living for generations as old-settlers have to give up their possession of lands to drift towards the peripheries or sustain by compromising their opulence. As observed, the middle-income groups are badly affected by the consequences of post-liberalized developments. This study has been done on the basis of the authors' participant observations, and review of different published literatures to build a theoretical framework, followed by perception surveys of the diverse residents to understand the problem and validate the proposition. It is argued, that unlike the traditional socially clustered neighbourhoods, especially in old Kolkata, the renewed vertical extension of the gated habitations is promoting more social segregations and exclusions in which interdependence and cohabitation in urban governance may not be truly representative, and therefore, unsustainable in future. The research can add significant knowledge in the domain of urban governance and appropriate designing of the cultural cityscape of Kolkata. © 2020 The Author(s).

Chapter One offers an ethnography of the social attitudes, small-scale economies, political constructs and technological adaptions of hillside families in southeastern Haiti. Chapter Two analyzes the ways in which senior museum administrators in Italy respond to falling attendance from a branding perspective. Chapter Three presents the challenges encountered while developing design strategies for historical city centers and construction projects over two case studies. Chapter Four discusses narration as a design methodology as well as a means of representation and presents examples of proposed urban design projects for five different cities. Chapter Five describes how the people in Costa Rica perceive edible flowers, if and how they consume them, how they buy them and how much they are acquainted with possible health risks associated with their consumption. Finally, Chapter Six focuses on the need to change governance strategies of tourist destinations due to globalization and technological development and proposes a methodological framework to responsibly manage stakeholders involved in tourism destinations. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

275,,2021,Book Chapter,Offending sights and urban governance: Expectations of city aesthetics and spatial responses to the unsightly,"The problem of incivilities seems to be considerably connected to the visibility of unsightly behaviour. Factors such as urban attractiveness and visibility of the homelessness play important roles in urban social control and have led to the sanitisation and gentrification of city centres. Visual exposure is also relevant to how people perceive and respond to crime. In times of Selfie Culture, where it seems particularly important to some people that the background of their image is beautiful and (Insta)grammable, the right to expose one’s unappetising vulnerability (e.g. homelessness) to the public may clash with others’ beliefs in their entitlement to not see anything ugly or with expectations for urban space to be ordered according to mainstream norms of aesthetic acceptability. The chapter, first, addresses the visibility of incivilities, framing the regulation of offending sights within the gaze-dependent culture. Next, it looks at the contemporary urban responses to the vulnerable groups many deem unsightly, focusing in particular on the spatial-defensive measures aimed at removing certain marginal groups, such as the homeless and youth, from urban space. It then critically examines the wider societal and normative implications of such social control. The chapter concludes with some reflections on defensive architecture within securitised society, and policy considerations. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Nina Peršak and Anna Di Ronco.",,Peršak N.,10.4324/9781003092643-5
277,,2021,Conference Paper,"Eco-mobility Approach for a Sustainable Neighbourhood Road Infrastructure within a Mixed-use Community: The Searchlight on Festac Town, Amuwo Odofin, Lagos","In major cities in Nigeria, the current modes of transportation are generally chaotic and unsustainable. We therefore have to rethink how to adopt the seamless integration of sustainable transportation alternatives. Poor maintenance is one of the factors adduced to be responsible for the current deteriorated state of mobility corridors and the existing road infrastructure. Overpopulation and increasing socio-economic activities of Festac Town exerts undue pressure on the infrastructure, thereby accelerating deterioration. The study is underpinned by Eco-mobility principles. This study is aimed at assessing the eco-mobility approach for a sustainable neighbourhood road infrastructure within a mixed-use community. Developing a sustainable mobility strategies that brings the neighborhood streets back to the people is an objective which this study pursue. A multi-staged sampling technique was adopted for the study. On-site qualitative approach was majorly employed through the interviews conducted assessing the major mobility corridors and streets from 1st to 7th avenues. A sample frame of 15 major roads with outdoor open spaces along the selected roads all within the selected avenues and major street roads. The instruments for data collection were oral interviews and personal/physical observations. The activity profiles, locational data and geospatial coordinates of each avenue were imported into ArcGIS (Version 10.5, ESRI) for various land-use analysis. The sustainable eco-mobility strategies will reduce transportation impacts, create civilized streets that meets environmental design standards of commuter's safety and comfort that are compatible with the unique urban structure and culture of metropolitan Lagos. This study evaluated the issues relating to sustainable eco-mobility, the connection between climate change and transportation systems, the impact of urban mobility on public health and wellbeing.

278,,2021,Article,(Re)framing spatiality as a socio-cultural paradigm: Examining the iranian housing culture and processes,"With rapid changes in urban living today, peoples’ behavioural patterns and spatial practices undergo a constant process of adaptation and negotiation. Using “house” as a laboratory and everyday life and spatial relations of residents as a framework of analysis, the paper examines the spatial planning concepts in traditional and contemporary Iranian architecture and the associated socio-cultural practices. Discussions are drawn upon from a pilot study conducted in the city of Kerman, to investigate ways in which contemporary housing solutions can better cater to the continually changing socio-cultural lifestyles of residents. Data collection for the study involved a series of participatory workshops and employed creative visual research methods, participant observation and semi structured interviews to examine the interlacing of everyday socio-spatial relations and changing perception of identity, belonging, socio-cultural and religious values and conflict. The inferences from the study showcases the emerging social and cultural needs and practices of people manifested through the complex relationship between residents, the places in which they live, and its spatial planning and organisation. For a better understanding of this complex relationship, the paper argues the need for resituating spatiality as a socio-cultural paradigm. © 2021 The Author(s).",Architecture; Housing; Iran; Planning; Socio-cultural; Spatial,"Rajendran L., Molki F., Mahdizadeh S., Mehan A.",10.3846/jau.2021.14032
279,,2021,Article,Cognitive-Cultural Looping Mechanism of Urban Space Conceptualization,"A crucial point for urban design is the acknowledgement that urban material structures are not only constituting a set of cognitive-cultural affordances that shapes people’s behavior and experiential world, but likewise that the design process itself is an expression of cultural conceptualizations possibly evoked by ongoing cultural practices and perceptions, thus forming a dynamic loop. In this paper, we outline a framework for the study of material, cultural and social mechanisms interacting with human cognition, behavior and emotions. We attempt a conceptual model that integrates dynamic interactions between cognitive-cultural affordances and our conceptualization of the environment and provides a few illustrative case examples. The model proposes a set of dynamic relations between cognitive and cultural processes at shorter time scales modifying conceptualizations and environmental affordances on longer timescales, while these – in turn – come to guide and constrain processes at the shorter timescales. The model has important implications for our understanding of the role of environmental design, especially urban design, as bridging between aspects of human situated experience, behavior, social and cultural norms and material culture. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Affordance; Cognition; Conceptualization; Human behavior; Urban design,"Alinam Z., Tylén K., Pirbabaei M.T., Gharehbaglou M.",10.1007/s12124-021-09642-8
282,,2021,Conference Paper,Spectacles of the Temporal City: An Analysis of the Effects of Festivals on Identity in an Urban Context,"Cities around the world are becoming complex systems wherein every city possess unique identity manifested through its people and activities that occur in its urban spaces. The sense of urban space is an ever-changing concept and to understand the fabric of urban spaces, knowledge of the concept of space and its interrelations is required. Reading a city in a time where change is the norm, with urban spaces gaining new meanings and functions with changes in cultural practices conveys the hybrid urgencies of metropolitan India. An analysis is thus, particularly relevant in India, as in the post-industrial scenario, cities in India have become some of the largest urban conglomerates with a dualist identity of static and kinetic pervading their urban landscape. The static city is the conventional physical entity of a city whereas, the kinetic city is perceived as a city in motion, temporary in nature and the emerging symbolic image of urban India. Understanding these multitudes of identities in the backdrop of traditional events and festivals, as temporal transformations of urban spaces will thus highlight the dominant visual culture of Indian cities. This Temporal City enables a better understanding of the blurred lines of contemporary urbanism and the changing roles of social space in the urban fabric. This study focused on the ancient festival of Ambubachi in the historic Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, India, through visual ethnography, participant observations, open-ended interviews, photography and document analysis. The central concern of this paper is to develop a critical stance on understanding the identities of cities through the study of urban spectacles such as festivals in a bid to illustrate the fluid and dynamic aspect of one’s identity that is being constantly redefined and reconstructed with time, space, activities and context. Through the analysis of this ancient festival of Ambubachi in the light of ‘identity’ and ‘place attachment’ of the festivalgoers, the emerging notions of identity will be explored. The fieldwork sought to analyse two major aspects: The first was the generic, spatial characteristics of festival spaces and the second was the temporal, fleeting events that occur in their physical settings following the parameters of event-space relationship by Frenchman in a bid to understand how such eventful urban spaces manifest in the negotiation of one’s identity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Festivals; Identity; Place attachment; Place identity; Social space,"Das A., Das A.K.",10.1007/978-981-16-0041-8_61
285,,2020,Article,"Migration, translation, and transformation of western urban planning models","People, ideas, lifestyles, cultures, architecture and urban planning models have invariably traversed the world as a consequence of military compulsions, political goals, commercial motivations, or aspirational values. Western models in particular have spread widely, first through colonization and, recently, as a consequence of globalization. It is well-known that many cities around the world have been impacted by western urban planning models but, curiously no comprehensive comparative study of these influences has so far been attempted. This essay stems from 5 years of teaching and research in the field of urban history and presents a series of examples from non-western contexts such as India, China, Africa, South America, and elsewhere to showcase the direct or indirect impact of several western urban planning models. The aim is to analyse how differently these models, such as the English garden city, Le Corbusier’s plan voisin concept, and Haussmann’s plan for Paris have been adopted by a number of non-western cities and the degree to which they have been transformed by local contexts. Indeed, frequently, the original concept of the exported model has been completely modified. The essay also identifies those western urban models which have spread most widely. There are, indeed, a series of western models which have proved more popular than others and it is worth attempting to understand why they have proved to be so. © 2020, The Author(s).",Cultural exchange; Migration; Planning; Urban; Western models,Guerrieri P.M.,10.1186/s40410-020-0113-0
287,,2020,Conference Paper,The outstanding universal value of the historic colonial centre of the city of gracias (Honduras),"This paper analyses the outstanding universal values, integrity, and authenticity of the city of Gracias (Honduras), as well as its protection and heritage management tools. The main objective is to demonstrate that Gracias meets the UNESCO requirements to qualify as a candidate for inclusion in the International List of the World Heritage Convention (1971). Gracias is a colonial Spanish city, founded in 1536, in the region of Lempira. It had great productive, strategic and administrative importance in Central America, demonstrated in part by its hosting of the 'Audiencia de los Confines'. The 'Audiencia' was the highest court of the Spanish Crown with jurisdiction over the current republics of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and the region of Chiapas. The aim of this court was to represent the interests of the indigenous people in these areas. An on-site analysis, diagnosis and assessment of the heritage elements was carried out from architectural, urban planning, historical, and intangible heritage perspectives. Additionally, other similar sites in Central America have been analysed for comparison. Results show that this city meets criterion iv of the World Heritage Convention: 'an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history'. Furthermore, the city´s heritage assets are well-preserved and most of them remain functional; the indigenous culture is alive; and planning, conservation and managing tools are in use. Currently, Gracias maintains its harmony and life and its respect for the natural environment, creating a cultural landscape that has been maintained for almost 500 years. © Authors 2020.

288,,2020,Article,"The relation between shoppers and different designs of commercial spaces; A humanistic approach, Irbid city as a case study","The development and implementation of urban planning is the fundamental basis for the construction and management of the city and its space, to ensure effective allocation of resources and the rational use of the land. And while the city is considered one of the most important means of accomplishing economic and social development goals, this paper argues that urban planning affects the relationship between the city and the city's people as well as the development of its commercial growth. This study aims to research and compare the advantages and the disadvantages between the shops opened directly to a street and the shops opened to a plaza (the pedestrian mall) in Irbid city downtown. The study has focused on the identification of architectural and urban patterns and the artistic aspects of urban design. Conversely, this research aims to identity the needs of the users by introducing the hypothesis that the behavioral patterns in any designed space relies on the designers personal perceptions and understanding of the behavioral and usage patterns of the individuals within it, the understanding of which positively reflects on both the spatial qualities and the individual's perception of it. The questions of this research are as follows: (1) What is the role of the design of the commercial shops in creating a sense of pleasure and safety in the downtown of Irbid city? (2) How do shops play out their role in the growth and expansion of commercial development? Through visual survey and the analytical studies of the GIS data, the research determines an overall preference of one of the market-space designs. The results show that shops which are opened to a plaza are vital in giving a sense of security and integrity to the concept of the downtown commercial area, it also provides organization among the different parts of the commercial area and plays two important roles: (1) they interconnect the different parts of the city's physical structure; and (2) the vital role of the city's economic and social life. In conclusion, this paper offers recommendations for the redesign and development of the building's regulations in the downtown to achieve the proper relationship between urban planning and urban development, deal with the modern city development and reflect the relationship with its own culture. © 2020 WITPress.

289,,2020,Article,"Of pirate drivers and honking horns mobility, authority, and urban planning in late-colonial accra","This article attempts to bridge two literatures—the African history of urban life and the colonial history of urban planning—in order to better understand the politics of African mobility. In doing so, it situates colonial histories of urban planning and emerging African cultures of auto-mobility within a broader critique of colonial technology and infrastructure. This article argues that the realities of indirect rule—the autonomy of African urban residents and the weakness of colonial authority and infrastruc-ture—raised new questions and problems for colonial officials who were tasked with turning ideology into policy and practice. In particular, mobility politics allow us to trace the way that “average” people negotiated colonial politics within and outside of the formal, elite structures of elected Town Councils, Legislative Assembles, or chieftaincy politics. Within the colonial bureaucracy and the Town Council, African elites negotiated their own prestige and status alongside the interests and demands of the city’s lower-and middle-class populations. © 2020 by the Society for the History of Technology.

The demographic and epidemiological aspects that are affecting western countries, the definitions of health and healthy cities given by the World Health Organization and the international documents dealing with sustainable development oblige building designers and urban planners to reconsider their social role and become “health operators”. The strict link between human beings and the built environment underlined both by Universal Design and International Classification of Functioning is the reasons why our cities and settlements need high quality urban spaces in order to enhance everyday life social dimension.

300,,2019,Conference Paper,Contributions for the Rehabilitation of the Castro da Senhora do Bom Sucesso-Mangualde (Portugal),"Portugal is undoubtedly, a destination for the practice of Nature Tourism, containing a vast and rich natural, historical and cultural heritage. This settlement, Castro of Senhora do Bom Sucesso is a place where the surrounding landscape stands out with several mountains around it, in an environment where the flora and fauna, characteristics of this region, stand out. The whole history of the place, refers to a certain period of the past, valuing it and able to make the experience that the Nature Tourism can provide even better. Being one of the highest places in the central region of Portugal, it is for many people, a special place of enjoyment and relaxation. In this place, hundreds of years ago, there were between 80 and 100 houses of ancient people from the Celtic culture. Later, due to the abandonment by Men, these houses became disused, falling into a rapid decay process with the collapse of walls and roofs, making the roads impassable and the place covered with vegetation. Thus, in this work, in methodological terms, based on literature review, the collection of cartographic elements of the place, and in the field and cabinet studies, it was possible to develop an investigation on the Military Heritage of the region, in order to analyze in detail, the relation of the nature of the place with the architecture. This work resulted in a proposal for the site of the former Castro do Bom Sucesso, with the main objective of creating an Ecotourism Park, around the Celtic culture and autochthonous nature, organized in the following main equipment: I) Reception of the Ecotourism Park; (ii) ""Celtic Bungalows"" iii) Celtic Interpretation Center; iv) biological pool and v) Camping. The paper presents the main elements developed, from the design to the form and location of the equipment that, to be built, is believed to improve the regional economy through a scientific, didactic, cultural and sustainable tourism. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Gomes Rodrigues M.V., Ferreira Gomes L.M., Cabral De Carvalho A.B., Miranda Beato C.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/4/042045
304,,2019,Conference Paper,Visitors Voice in Historic Sites Interpretation Centres in Bahrain,"Throughout the past decade, a number of site interpretation centres, such as site museums, visitor centres, site exhibits, have grown in Bahrain, a country that is seeking international recognition through culture. This specific typology of museums intends to explain the nearby historical site through the use of multiple interpretation strategies. Understanding the visitors' expectations is an important component in the success of cultural institutions. Exploring the components of a visitor experience and expectations within site interpretation centres has, so far, received limited attention. Hence, this research intends to analyse the visitors' experience and expectations in a specific site interpretation centre in Bahrain: Qalat al Bahrain Site Museum. The visitor's experience and expectations were assessed through two streams of feedbacks. First, an analysis of the comments recorded on the visitors' book. These comments addressed the visitors' reflections, expectations, experiences, and the type of activities undertaken within the premises. Second, the online TripAdvisor from 169 valid returns, 200 TripAdvisor comments and an overview of the visitors' written comments, different types of emotional and spiritual experience expectations were extracted for further analysis... In parallel, this research analysed visitors' behaviour through observation inclusive of different timings during the day and during the year to understand the impact of climatic condition on the visitors' experience and expectations for validation purposes. Finally, some related scholarship discussions and suggestions were proposed based on visitors voice and reflection underlining the reasons why people choose to visit site interpretation centres with reference to personal and social demands. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Al-Saffar M., Anissa Tabet Aoul K.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/5/052006
305,,2019,Conference Paper,South Chile - Extreme Architecture,"Typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions on the one hand, and the lack of roads due to the inaccessibility of mountain areas and the extended coastline, combined with the harsh climate of both hot and polar, on the other, make designing and building in Chile an extreme task. It is and always was also hard to design and build in Chile due to the isolation of this country from the rest of the South American continent thanks to the difficulty to overcome the barrier formed by the Andes. Can these unique conditions be used to create a unique architecture that brings new qualities to global heritage? Perhaps all these ""threats"" are also a significant potential for creation, using beautiful landscapes and pure nature. In the beginning, there was the Word. Architectural culture requires faith and extreme sacrifice. For this reason, the presentation begins with a project to which its architects devoted their lives and decided to become men of the cloth. Buildings devoted to religious worship often exceed the utilitarian dimension of architecture, becoming the determinants of directions that architecture will follow. An example of this heroic expression of architecture is the construction of the Benedictine Church in Les Condes, a suburb of Santiago, in 1962-1964. Can Theatre be a cure allowing people to overcome trauma? The programme of reconstruction of the city of Concepción in Chile after the destruction wrought in 2010 by the tsunami, included not only the restoration of previously existing housing and infrastructural functions, but also the introduction of new cultural function. In 2011, an architectural competition for the design of the Regional Theatre was announced, which was won by three Chilean architects Smiljan Radić, Eduardo Castillo and Gabriela Medrano. The building was put into use in 2018 and is not only a monument of the past, but also a sign of a new beginning (Figure 1). One of Chile's greatest natural resources is its diverse landscape. Difficult accessibility of many areas, low population density and unfavourable climate are the main factors that have caused large areas of land to remain in their natural state. Along with the development of society and the popularisation of tourism, a need arose to build the right background for exploring these natural values. The history tourism in extreme conditions is not long. In Poland, for example, it dates to 1850, when the first winter expedition to the Valley of Five Ponds in the Tatra Mountains took place. In Chile, the first tourist expedition to Patagonia took place in 1879 and was described in the book by its organiser and participant, Lady Lorance Dixie (Dixie, 1880). These extremely hard natural conditions have created a unique opportunity to create modern architecture in interaction with the natural landscape. We will examine this problem on the example of 5 hotels and 5 ways of interacting with the landscape and study these architectural ideas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Butelski K.,10.1088/1757-899X/603/2/022047
307,,2019,Article,Une ville des jardins: The consiglio d’ornato and the urban transformation of nice (1832-1860),"This article examines the urban transformation of Nice in the early nineteenth century. It does so using the papers of the Consiglio d’Ornato (1832-1860), an urban planning committee charged with overseeing the development of the city at a time of demographic and economic growth brought about by tourism. This article argues that the Consiglio cooperated with private speculators to create a city rooted in a series of myths—Orientalist, Greco-Roman, and early Christian—that both shaped and were shaped by the expectations of world-wearied tourists. Nice was turned into a commodity whose purpose was to provide tourists with a feeling of fleeing a modern world characterized by instability and inauthenticity. Paradoxically, as a direct result, Nice became one of the earliest cities to experience a modern form of consumer capitalism in which people, places, cultures, and nature itself were packaged and peddled to the leisured classes. © The Author(s) 2018.",France; Nice; Nineteenth century; Tourism; Urbanism,Moak D.G.,10.1177/0096144218768499

Every four years the Games capture our attention to a grand festive that fascinates millions of people. Accordingly, when a city decides to make a bid, all its concerns is much more captivated by the urban transformation impact on the city whether it's a positive or a negative one. As a result, several factors, if not well-organized and taken into consideration in the strategic development plans of the host cities, may be a burden on the city. Site selection for the event is considered one of the main critical decisions to assure the possibility of the host of the Games by the city. Therefore, this paper reviews several case studies that proved its success in location choice under the delivery of sustainable urban design and strategic planning for the host city. It attempts to mention the main urban design elements affected by the preparation process. Consequently, an urban design sustainable assessment will be developed highlighting both the main urban design factors affected due to the host of the Olympic Games and, the main sustainable key factors affected by the urban changes on site. © 2019, Cairo University.

310,,2019,Article,Man-environment relationship of public square case study in dutch square melaka,"The square is one of the major constituent element of open public space in urban design. It is seen as the core of a city which functions as a focal point in the public space network, providing a space for the community social interaction. However, many of the new public spaces in the 20th century has been a void setting and unsuccessful to create a public open space for social interaction that is vibrant with life. The notion of square was adopted from the European culture as far back as 17th century and has been adapted in Malaysia. This could be seen in today’s square design in Malaysia. However, the behaviour pattern indicate otherwise as the present day square design does not respond to the local climatic context with lack of shaded areas. Hence, people tend to avoid social interactions in public square during daytime due to undesirable weather condition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the positive aspects of traditional square that has been successful in supporting the community social interaction, and establishing a general guide for the design of new square as a public open space in Malaysian context. Amongst the consideration to be derived from this adaption is the Malaysian local context in terms of historical significance, culture and climate. Dutch Square in Melaka Historical Town was chosen as the case study, because it represents a model of traditional square as a public open space that still functions in term of attracting people to this day. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches were used in this study. Behavioral mapping allowed for statistical analysis where as observation and still photography as the descriptive to support the outcome of behavioural mapping. Therefore, the data collected are more reliable and able to be cross checked for further examinations of the findings. Findings showed that the relationship of the urban context and social behaviour are associative with one another. The square plays an important role to provide a setting in the built environment and the behaviour pattern and activities to determine the success of the square as an open public space. The aim is to provide an appropriate public open space in the built environment that is robust and meaningful to the community. © BEIESP.",Behaviour; Landscape; Man-environment; Public Square,"Jie T.K., Ja’Afar N.H.",
312,,2019,Conference Paper,Selected Problems of Implementation of Standards for Unified System of Tactile Indicators,"The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is intended to allow independent functioning and full access to all realms of life to all people with disabilities. The Convention imposes an obligation on the state to ensure that all persons with disabilities have access to physical environment, means of transport, information and communication, including ICT technologies and systems, as well as other tools and services, commonly accessible or assured, both in the cities and in the countryside, on equal basis. Having this in mind, together with the voice of the persons with blindness or having greatly reduced vision, and taking into account the chaos in the markings in public space that were supposed to improve the way the persons with disabilities move, it is necessary to design and implement the adequate standards on the roads and in the streets. It is estimated that about 5% of the total country population in Poland are persons with disabilities. About 1.8 million of them are people affected by blindness, partial blindness or low vision, who at the same time are active participants of the public space and of the road traffic. However, the lack of any systemic solutions regulated by law that improve safety in the road traffic is a serious problem in enabling access to culture, as well as free and safe movement for persons with poor vision.

316,,2019,Book Chapter,Floating Village Cua Van: Promoting Climate-Adaptive Ecotourism with Principles of Living Spaces,"Ha Long Bay—the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site on Vietnam’s northeastern seacoast—is often considered one of the world’s most beautiful bays. This bay is also famous for many floating fishing villages where the people live together on the sea as a community. However, due to rapid population growth in the floating villages, the present situation shows lacks in urban planning, waste management and development of infrastructure. Ha Long Bay had suffered the pressure of environmental pollution and resource degradation. Since 2014, in order to protect the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the local authority has planned a project to demolish the floating villages and move these communities to the mainland. In fact, the demolition project has caused the loss of cultural heritage and a tourist attraction in Ha Long Bay. The goal of this study is to propose a sustainable concept of living space organization for Cua Van, the largest floating village in Ha Long Bay, in order to preserve, revive, and promote floating communities as a unique heritage culture and tourist attraction. Therefore, a detailed analysis of environment and socio-cultural, economic, architectural characteristics of Cua Van is provided in this study. The analysis does not only accumulate precious traditional values that need to be preserved and developed in the proposed concept but also illustrate its weakness that need to be addressed to optimally design the future sustainable floating village. Based on these studies, as well as on general principles of a sustainable floating community and promoting ecotourism, the study proposes a living space concept for Cua Van, including solutions to both a sustainable floating community adapting to climate change and ecotourism development. The proposed concept would ensure stable and permanent living on the water for water dwellers and reduce human-induced impacts on the environment as well as an increasing livelihood income by tourism development. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Climate change; Ecotourism; Floating villages; Sustainable floating community,"Trang N.T.T., Vukorep I., Stopp H.",10.1007/978-3-030-10804-5_2
322,,2018,Conference Paper,The Public Policy Strategies Fostering Smart Cities,"According to the Getùlio Vargas Foundation - FGV (2015), Smart Cities are people interacting and using energy systems, materials, services and financing to catalyze economic development and improved quality of life. These interaction flows are considered smart for making strategic use of infrastructure, services, information and communication with urban planning and management to meet social and economic needs of society. According to Berrone (2016), the 10 dimensions indicate the level of intelligence of a city: governance, public administration, urban planning, technology, the environment, international connections, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. Thus, this study is proposed here address two of these topics: governance and economy. To Araúhajo (2002), the term governance as the ability of a government has to design and implement their policies this ability refers to the financial sphere, managerial and technical, while governance implies the conditions the exercise of political is based on the analysis of these dimensions that see the role of social cohesion so necessary for the construction of a structure and culture of smart cities. Once appropriating this culture, economic development will be the reflection of that interaction. According to Nakagama, cases successful in smart cities as Australia, show that generating real business results of short-term, especially as the government encouragement (tax incentives and access to credit), provides a creative economy, able to retain talents in local companies with good revenue. Thus, this paper aims to make a thematic focus on what public policy strategies that drive the construction of smart cities in order to verify the impact of public policies and this study the importance of public engagement in governance: identify talent retention strategies and analyze the socio-economic development. Thus, a descriptive and exploratory methodology grounded in case study of governance practices in Australia will be applied, these practices opposed to the Brazilian. © 2017 IEEE.",Economic Development; public Policies; Smart Cities,"Lima I., Marques C., Moraes R., Sarmento V., Carvalho Z.",10.1109/S3C.2017.8501409

329,,2017,Review,Uncanny and dystopian city: An analysis of Siva,"With rapid urbanisation and people's migration from rural to urban areas in search of work, education and other opportunities, urban conglomerations in India are rapidly growing. A city is marked by diversity, modernity, high-rise buildings, modern infrastructure and consumerism. Popular culture is one of the many resources for understanding the cityscape. The city is not just about physical and material spaces but also includes the lived experiences, interactions, contestations, exclusions and power relationships. Many urban geographers opine that cinema reflects and represents these issues as well as the discourses about the city. There is little or no research on the Cinematic City of Hyderabad. This article analyses the movie Siva, which captured the essence of the city of Hyderabad. The discussion maps out its urban spaces by using semiotic and discourse analysis, and addresses the different themes that the discourse reveals. In sum, Siva captures the anxiety, violence and evolution of a dystopian city and provides insights to the potential fate of similar urban conglomerations. © 2017 Urbanities.",Cinema; Cinema and geography; Cinematic city; City; Film studies; Hyderabad; Urban studies,Krishna D.,

This paper developed human mobility system using random way point and random walk methods to model the individual movement of person in different places within area of Baghdad, Iraq. There are a lot of types of mobility model but we use Random Way Point (RWP) because it is simple, most common use and needs less memory and time for computation. The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city. Al-Sadar city is one of biggest population city in Baghdad, Iraq. It has three millions people population. We choose 5000 users moves from Al-Sadar city to two different places in Baghdad: Al- Khadmia and Al-Zawra. Al-Khadmiia is old and religion place and Al-Zawra is biggest public garden in Baghdad. In our work, we find the best ways that connect Al-Sadar city with both places. We decide the best ways depending on distances and traffic between them.

335,,2016,Book Chapter,Promptness and sustainability in town reconstruction following the 2011 great east Japan earthquake,"Local governments in Iwate Prefecture also drew respective plans for reconstruction to rebuild their cities, financially backed up by the prefectural and national governments coupled with special laws and measures. They are planning central city areas under the principles of DRR as well as BBB. There are too many laws pertaining to disaster prevention and reconstruction to refer to in full here. Therefore, this chapter focuses only on some of the new enactments after the GEJE. But attention has to be paid to their approaches to reconstruction when it comes to the question of whether they sufficiently concord with DRR and BBB (Ikuta 2013; Kaneko 2014). The Basic Act on Reconstruction in Response to the GEJE 2011 (hereinafter the Basic Act 2011) prescribes that, considering the unprecedented national crisis caused by the GEJE, the act has the purpose of promoting the smooth and prompt reconstruction and revitalization of a vibrant Japan, securing financial resources, identifying afflicted areas as Special Zones for Reconstruction with institutional and tax measures and establishing a Reconstruction Agency to undertake tasks regarding integrated national measures (Art. 1). The Basic Act 2011 then prescribes its basic philosophy, adopting the idea of the building back better concept, promoting dramatic measures for revitalization that are not limited to physical recovery of afflicted facilities, but also reconstruction measures to assist individuals to overcome the disaster and lead prosperous lives while honoring local culture and enhancing people’s ties with the community (Art. 2). The Act for Special Zones for Reconstruction 2011 was enacted as separate legislation from the Basic Act 2011 to implement the reconstruction measures. Under this legislation, afflicted local governments designated as special areas can acquire significantly larger budget funds from the national government for recovery and can deregulate their spatial planning under the Agricultural Land Act, the Forest Act and the Urban Planning Act. Via this funding and deregulation, they can plan recovery-related projects for disaster prevention: the promotion of collective relocation, functional reinforcement of fishery villages, land reallocation for the revival of affected city areas, basic construction to lead city centers towards recovery from the tsunami and disaster-resistant public housing. The Act on Town Planning for Tsunami Disaster Prevention 2011 allows prefectural governments to set tsunami hazard zones and municipal governments to make integrated town plans for tsunami disaster prevention.

336,,2016,Article,"Formulation of design criteria based on recognition and comparison of user patterns of behavior, emphasizing on the role of climate in urban public spaces, case studies: Shahr-E-Kord and Bushehr","Introduction: Climate has always been one the main factors of designing urban spaces in Iran since past centuries. By analyzing urban spaces it can be concluded that different cities have different urban spaces due to climate differences. One of the main reasons of the differences in the type and orientation of urban spaces is the climate as one of the key factors in designing these areas. Regarding climate in designing is equivalent to involving the users of the space, basically because climate adjustments can encourage more people to use the designed spaces. Hence, it can be said that climatic spaces are humanistic spaces as well. Therefore, climate directly influence culture and plays a decisive role both in the body and behavior of the users. Thus, it could have a very effective role in how people use or how they behave in designed spaces. Materials and methods: A mix of several methods has been used for more compatibility with research purposes. This used library documents and has a comparative-analytical method. The basic data and the research background information have been gathered through documentative method and from library resources. For the fieldwork, the descriptive method (describing the phenomenon) has been used. Then, people patterns of behaviors were studied by an interpretative-qualitative method in each climate to analyze and infer the discussions in order. And at last, a comparative method has been used to analyze the results in order to set out urban design criteria. In this comparative method, it was tried to compare people patterns of behavior in two cold-mountainous, and hot and humid climates, and to analyze its results to elicit criteria for urban space design considering the effects of climate on the user behaviors. In this research, the people behaviors were studied, analyzed and compared in two different seasons of the year (the hottest and the coldest seasons) by the use of serial photography. Thus, people different patterns of behaviors in different climates and the ways they use the spaces were investigated, by the observation a set of design criteria could be developed to be applied in the design/redesign of urban spaces to improve their qualities. (Figure Presented) The theory In general, people uses of urban spaces may have two stages: 1. Presence in urban space. 2. Tendency to continue to stay in the urban space. There are two kinds of qualities in urban environment. First, the qualities which are the main requirements of people presence in public spaces, i.e. primary qualities. Second, the qualities encouraging people to stay in the space for a longer time. Meanwhile, there are some qualities like climatic comfort which play effective role in both primary and secondary qualities. This very important factor is in full adaptation with human physical characteristics and is the main requirement of people presence in the space. It also plays an undeniable role in the way people use the space and behave there. Climatic comfort can increase the number of opportunities to use the space. If the space is designed with consideration of all aspects, including the user behaviors, it can be used by all people in various periods of time during the day, and in different seasons. Results and discussion: Design guidelines in hot and humid climate are formulated. They emphasize on the role of climate to determine people patterns of behavior. Here, regarding the achievements of local observations and the recognition, the design criteria are proposed at two different scales, the city scale and the site scale. A) The city scale: Location of the space in the shade: This is the most important factor affecting the use of space in hot and humid climates. If the open space includes shaded parts, people preference to stay there will increase. Therefore, location in the shade can be considered as an important requirement for people use of space in this climate. Other factor is natural ventilation and the space orientation parallel to the wind flows: This is the second factor affecting the use of public spaces in hot and humid climate. Natural ventilation of open spaces happens by the airflows coming from the sea. It helps the locals reduce the high unpleasant humidity in this climate, so it encourages passersby to stop and stay in the space. B) The site scale: • To avoid designing vast urban open spaces in hot and humid climate. • Making orientation of the open spaces toward the sea to moderate the hot weather and reduce the humidity by the sea airflows. Local observations also verify that successful spaces in this climate have perpendicular orientation to the sea to benefit from its cool airflows for natural ventilation. Formulating design guidelines in cold and mountainous climate emphasizes the role of climate to determine people pattern of behavior: Local observations in Shahr-E-Kord show that the two fallowing factors have determined the role of people use of space in cold and mountainous climate. 1-Maximizing the direct sunshine: It is a positive point for the open spaces in the cold winter weather of mountainous climate, because it helps the space to be more welcoming and favorable for people. 2-Not to be windward: This factor also has direct effect on how people attend and behave in the space. The researcher's observations and notes in cold and mountainous climate show that the spaces which are exposed to direct wind flows are not favorable for people. A) The city scale: • For designing open spaces and its proposed land uses, it is better to locate attractive uses at the southern and east-southern side of the space, because it helps to provide favorable sunlight for the space during cold winter days and facilitates the use of space for people. • In the cold and mountainous climate, it is better to design urban spaces in form of small squares because it reduces the entrance of wind flows and provides people with climatic comfort. It must be mentioned that vast squares in this climate can benefit from the increased direct sunlight and heat. But the effect of the increased airflows in these spaces is highly unfavorable and disturbs the climatic comfort. Thus, they are not recommended. B) The site scale: • It is better to design crowded spaces as semi-open spaces, because enclosed and covered spaces are more favorable in all seasons for their shelters from the sun, wind, rain and snow. • In cold climates, it is important to use types of plants which prevent spaces from undesired wind, while not casting shades during cold seasons, since trees can provide favorable shades for summer time. Conclusion: The results and findings of this research are presented in a set of operational and applicable recommendations, some of which might seem unimportant. But they are undeniably essential. Simple solutions for ordinary problems of existing urban spaces can lead to significant improvements in the space vitality and people social life. William White expresses the extract of his long term studies in one sentence: ""people seat where the seating exists."" This sentence might seem clear and typical, but it is very important and can notably change the life of a city. Thus, the simplicity of changes does not mean that they are inconsiderable. It might be possible to change the destination of a space simply by adding shelters and awnings or providing sunny spaces in cold and mountainous climates and shaded spaces in hot and humid ones.",Behavior patterns; Bushehr; Climate; Climatic comfort; Shahr-E-Kord,"Bahrainy S.H., Aghakarimi A.",
341,,2016,Book,"Rights to public space: Law, culture, and gentrification in the American west","This book examines the roles that public space plays in gentrification. Considering both cultural norms of public behavior and the municipal regulation of behavior in public, it shows how commonplace acts in everyday public spaces like sidewalks, streets, and parks work to establish neighborhood legitimacy for newcomers while delegitimizing once authentic public practices of long-timers. With evidence drawn from the formerly Latino neighborhood of Highland in Denver, Colorado, this ethnographic study demonstrates how the regulation of public space plays a pivotal role in neighborhood change. First, there is often a profound disharmony between how people from different cultural complexes interpret and sanction behavior in everyday public spaces. Second, because regulations, codes, urban design, and enforcement protocols are deliberately changed, commonplace activities longtime neighborhood residents feel they have a right to do along sidewalks and streets and within their neighborhood parks sometimes unexpectedly misalign with what is actually possible or legal to do in these publicly accessible spaces. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",Gentrification; Governance; Neighborhood change; Public space; Urban planning; Urban sociology; Urban studies; US west,Langegger S.,10.1007/978-3-319-41177-4
346,,2016,Conference Paper,Designing for small bathrooms,"This paper will focus on how to design a series of bathroom products that work well for small bathrooms using the principles of universal design. In home culture research, Quitzau and Røpke has studied bathroom transformation from hygiene to well-being. Bathrooms are one of the rooms in apartments that do not have good solutions for small spaces. This is unfortunate since it is the bathroom that has the least amount of space in urban apartments. This leads many people to have too little bathroom space due to furniture, toilets, showers, etc. In today's society, the bathroom is no longer just a purpose room. It is used for relaxation and wellness. This has led to a trend where large furniture, such as freestanding bathtubs, dominate today's market. This in turn allows the few solutions that exist for small bathrooms to remain poorly conceived. The research question was therefore how to create solutions for small bathrooms to get the same sense of well-being as in larger bathrooms through universal design principals. The principles of universal design, observations and in-depth interviews were used in the study. This study can help to create a greater understanding of how to design small bathrooms. It will be relevant in a cross disciplinary field, including for professionals in plumbing, product design and technical solutions. This will also increase the well-being of users of the bathroom.",Bathroom design; Interview; Observation; Urban design,"Sivertsen A.K., Berg A.",
348,,2015,Book Chapter,Divided we stand: The Indian city afer economic liberalisation,"In the wake of economic liberalisation in the early 1990s, the Indian city has displaced the village in public imagination as the quintessence of India as rising, modern global power. The nature and rate of urbanisation and urban growth have elicited multiple interpretations, notwithstanding an emerging consensus about the importance of the city in India’s future. With cities, especially larger ones, being seen to propel economic growth in post-liberalisation India, they have come to be the focus of extensive, and arguably unprecedented, development policies. If urban development policies have seen a sea of change in post-liberalisation period, these have been matched with the introduction of new forms of urban governance. Indian cities are often represented as a melting pot of people, spaces and cultures. Cities, as configured by institutions, practices and ideas of governance, relating to both private and state actors, remain exclusionary spaces from the perspective of the poor, despite the upsurge of ‘inclusion’ as a stated public commitment. © 2016, 2018 selection and editorial matter, Knut A.

353,,2014,Book Chapter,Shifting gears: The intersections of race and sustainability in Memphis,"Memphis is a city of dichotomies and disparities, a perplexing city of illustrative idiosyncrasies and instructive ironies. The city roils with a sweaty, gritty, creative energy, yet it has struggled to find a creative solution to overcoming its challenging past. As a global center of commerce and trade, the prosperity of the United States relies heavily on Memphis, yet Memphis is home to some of the nation’s most impoverished communities. The city is stretched geographically, fiscally, and socially in so many directions that gaining a sense of unity around any shared cultural ideal is a daunting exercise, one that Memphis has only recently begun to undertake. This chapter explores the emergence of “sustainability” in policy making and cultural perceptions in Memphis through conversations and controversies surrounding a proposal to institute a multi-use trail network across a geophysical landscape marked by socioeconomic and racial segregation. As Wanda Rushing (2009) puts it, “for more than one hundred years, changing views of space and place, conflicting values of ‘progress’ and preservation, as well as divisions of race, class, and gender have affected the physical and symbolic production of urban landscapes in Memphis” (Rushing 2009). How does the concept of “sustainability” as a social ideal play into the policies and decision making that are going to shape the future of a global city mired in a history of especially poor race relations, white flight, and cultural isolationism? A conversation on “sustainability” cannot occur without first dismantling a racialized “culture of fear” that impacts nearly every aspect of urban life in Memphis (Glassner 2000). To accomplish this, we dissect the discourses and practices associated with “community” and “safety” as they relate to transportation policy, urban planning, and alternative transportations infrastructure projects. We demonstrate how “safety” and “community” take on different meanings, even in adjoining neighborhoods, and provide ethnographic snapshots of people and communities affecting (or affected by) various connectivity and livability projects. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,"Farr M.A., Brondo K.V., Anglin S.",10.1017/CBO9781139923316.020

Case study of Poznan, Poland","The paper deals with the questions of a public space creation through the implementation of art and design. The idea of promotion the cultural features within a public space helps to increase the city space attractiveness. The author presents the case study of a downtown area of a city of Poznan in Poland, Wielkopolska region. As a result of an observation that there is a lack of a public space of culture and art in Poznan city centre, there is presented a proposal of an innovative and attractive functions implementation. There is also presented the research method of public space activization through art and design. The art is understood not only as temporary events but as the pieces of a small architecture and built areas of a cultural function as well. There was created an idea of a MAD city for people - which means searching for meaning, action and design in a city centre space. This idea is to be used as a tool to identify the existing and potential space for art in a city centre and to define whether it is a space of sacrum or of profanum. The tool helps to define what is the best use and purpose of a space in a context of an art implementation. It is also to create a functional system of socially and spatially attractive public spaces within a city centre. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

356,,2014,Conference Paper,Impacts of rail technology in 21st Century U.S. Cities,"This presentation analyzes the impact of transit technologies on the urban environment and evaluates land use, station design, and transit costs as a means of projecting the best options for intermodal stations and transit-oriented developments. Several commuter rail, AMTRAK, and freight rail corridors may be used in the future to accommodate heavy, light and/or high-speed rail systems in the United States. Diesel/electric locomotives, which populate urban rail corridors, have heavy load requirements and are industrial and/or utilitarian in appearance. However, diesel multiple units (DMUs) with lighter weight, increased fuel efficiency, ease of accessibility, additional capacity, enhanced performance and lower costs are competing for their market share. Currently, monorails, people movers, and streetcars - along with the traditional light and heavy rail systems - have public acceptance to enrich the urban environments surrounding the existing corridors, and enhance commuter experience. Many cities, however, are at a crossroads regarding transitioning from an automobile culture to a rail culture. Therefore, local cities willingly embrace opportunities for better environments. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Verma A.,10.1061/9780784413364.045

378,,2008,Conference Paper,The method of livable environmental evaluation based on remote sensing technology,"Livable environment is one of the hot topics within the realm of the international research in urban science, and it recently becomes the focus of global governments and city residents. The evaluative content of a livable city came out more earlier in developed country, and got rapid development.Presently, the developed countries have set up one and another representatives of livable city, while China is still in the process of urbanization and industrialization.When we are cheering the tremendous success during the reformation, we should also realize the harm as a result of those achievements to environment.So, a livable city has become the development target by more and more cities.When evaluating a livable city, we should make sure the evaluation indices system.Presently?relevant researches of theory about the evaluation indices from home and aboard are based on economic, society, environment, landscape, culture, safety and so on. Those data are gathered either statistic or through questionnaire and investigate. While livable city is a complex system with biological integrality, just one or two outstanding indices can not show that the residential environment is on a high level.Therefore, the paper sets up the evaluative framework and method of a livable city focusing on remote sensing data. Then discusses how to gather and choose information with RS and GIS technique, confirm the definitions, quantify all the indices to make them meaningful and comparative.And when we are choosing their indices, we should take account of the way of how to get these data, the method of handling and quantifying those information.The index system based on multi-scale remote sensing information includes contents as follows: traffic density and convenience, distribution and volume ratio of urban buildings, analysis on the landscape pattern of urban green-space and ecological construction, spatial configuration of urban city, urban heat effect, monitoring and evaluation of wetland area, assessment of ecological environment and security, vegetation fraction estimation, distribution of infrastructures, land use and land cover, terrain and physiognomy, geological disaster-prone area analysis, water conservation district, urban open area and so an.And the paper integrates these information with that of non-remote sensing, such as people's identify with the residential environment, amenity of nature environment, convenience of public establishment, satisfaction of human relations and so on.After analyzing, quantifying and evaluating those data, the paper then brings forward a comprehensive index system.Moreover, the paper presents the comprehensive evaluation model aiming to assess the residential environment of Chongqing city. The model includes a large amount of factors-factors on remote sensing and other assistant factors coming from statistic data.When building the model, we should take the consistency and standardization process between different remote sensing data, and between remote sensing data with non-remote sensing data into account, also the independence, representative and importance of these factors.Therefore, we should analyze and evaluate all the factors to make sure the remarkable ones, eliminate redundancy information, and make certain the power of the factors which are used in the model.Thus, the paper sets up the comprehensive evaluation model, and does researches and evaluation on the residential environment. At last the paper puts forward the measures about how to improve human settlements, and give suggestions for the urban planning, reformation and development for a livable city. © 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

386,,2005,Conference Paper,North Americas first civil engineers construct seventh century suspension bridge at yaxchilan,"A millennium before Europeans reached the Americas, the Maya had developed one of the world's longest lasting civilizations. This society reached its peak during the classic period, which extended from 250 BC to 900 AD. During their 2000-year history, the Maya held domain over a powerful Empire ruled by City States. The Maya Empire established a scientifically based culture while Europe languished in the Dark Ages. During their classic period, the Maya developed numerous scientific and engineering advancements. These ingenious people developed a mathematical system that recognized the concept of the number zero seven hundred years before the Europeans; a calendar system that is more advanced than our current calendar; ingenious engineering applications including manufacturing of cement, clear span cast-in-place concrete structures; and a complex infrastructure that served the needs of their sophisticated and highly populated ceremonial urban centers. Around 700 AD the Maya achieved an exceptional feat in civil engineering history with the construction of a long-span suspension bridge across the Usumacinta River at the ceremonial center at Yaxchilan. The 63 meter center span was the longest in the world until Italian engineers constructed a 76 meter bridge over the Adda River in northern Italy in 1377.",,O'Kon J.A.,

388,,2005,Article,People's perception and behavior patterns in Amman's public parks and plazas,"This study aims to research the behavioral patterns in the various areas public parks and major urban plazas of the Greater Amman area. During the past 40 years, studies have focused on the identification of architectural and urban patterns and the artistic aspects of urban design. Conversely, this research aims to identity the behavior and needs of the users by introducing the hypothesis that the behavioral patterns in any designed space relies on the designers personal perceptions and understanding of the behavioral and usage patterns of the individuals within it, the understanding of which positively reflects on both the spatial qualities and the individuals perception of it. To test the previous hypothesis, two urban plazas were selected, the Al-Hussien Sukaina Park located in a middle-income residential commercial district and the ""Culture A venue"" in a high-income commercial district. Through analytical studies and the utilization of questionnaires, the research concludes an overall preference of the simplicity of the former over the complexity of the design concept and elements of the latter. © Faculty of Engineering Alexandria University, Egypt.",Behavior patterns; Landscape perception; Plaza design,"Mahadin K.O., Ghanimeh A.A., Al-Najjar S., Al-Ejel N.",
389,,2004,Conference Paper,The development strategy of sustainable regional level water management plan: An agenda for Bangladesh perspectives.,"In common with current global concerns over wise use and effective management of water, the Government of Bangladesh is committed to exploring, developing and using its water resources to the benefit of all users. To this end the Ministry of Water Resources published the first National Water Policy in 1999,whereas the paper focuses the Regional Water Management Plan (RWMP) with the intention of guiding both public and private actions in the future for ensuring optimal development and management of water that benefits both individuals and the society at large. This Paper aims to ensure progress towards fulfilling national goals of economic development, poverty alleviation, food security, public health and safety, decent standard of living for the people and protection of the natural environment. The Plan is presented in three phases: in the short-term (2000-05) it is considered a firm plan of ongoing and new activities; in the medium-term (2006-10) it is an indicative plan, and in the long-term (2011-25) a perspective plan. Implementation of the plan is to be monitored regularly and it will be updated every five years (IWRM, 2002). Water is central to the way of life in Bangladesh. Indeed, the river systems, many of which emanate from outside the country, have shaped much of the history, economy, literature and rich culture of the people. However, with a burgeoning population of 129 million expected to rise to 181 million by 2025 and to 224 million by 2050 (IWRM, 2002), the country faces many challenges ahead in an era of increasing globalization. Rapid urbanization is expected with 40% of people living in the towns and major cities by 2025, and 60% by 2050 (WARPO, 2001). Poverty is still endemic with over half the population classified as poor. In addressing these and other related issues, this paper sets new paradigms for the water sector, which include: decentralized water management; cost sharing and cost recovery; private sector participation; community participation; nontraditional financing modalities; regulation separated from supply; and new rights, obligations and accountability.",,"Hafiz R., Chowdhury S., Sultana S.",
390,,2002,Conference Paper,Inter-organisational co-operation in improving access to activity centres by public transport,"The accessibility to city centres and large attraction parks increasingly becomes an issue of concern for location owners. They seek possibilities to offer transport services as an alternative to car use. In doing so, co-operation with public transport companies is important. These companies do not yet have the culture and opportunities to develop tailor-made services. Institutional changes yielding more market incentives and good information sharing should help to bridge the gaps between these parties. In particular a shared view on the service level to be offered, based on investigation of visitors' preferences, should be the starting point for inter-organisational co-operation.",,"Van Der Heijden R.E.C.M., Van Der Elst A., Veeneman W.W.",
392,,1997,Conference Paper,Overcoming politically induced resistance to payment for water in South Africa's urban areas,"The difficulties faced by South Africa in achieving reasonable levels of payment for water supplied in urban areas are in many respect similar to those applicable throughout the world. In some respects, however, the problems are very different. Decades of having to endure a politically offensive system has created negative attitudes in the bulk of the population towards authority, and indeed towards service providers. These attitudes will not easily change. As the majority of people had not real involvement in governance in the evolving political system during the nineteen eighties they increasingly regarded all authority as illegitimate. An illegitimate system quite naturally had to be resisted and replaced. The objective of resistance was to make the country ungovernable and hence open to change. By withholding, initially, housing rental repayments to the State and, later, services payments to local authorities a powerful weapon was brought into play. But with it came many other attitude changes, currently referred to as a 'culture of non-payment', which the new democratic government is now forced to grapple with. The degree to which the levels of payment for water services can be improved to acceptable levels will be dependent in a general sense upon government's success in changing attitudes and, in particular, on water authorities persuasiveness in inducing customers to take responsibility for paying for services rendered.",,Bath V.J.,
