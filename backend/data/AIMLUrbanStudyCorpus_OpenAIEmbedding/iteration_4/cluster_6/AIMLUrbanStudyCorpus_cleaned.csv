6,1,,Reconciling data-driven crime analysis with human-centered algorithms,Crime analysis; Machine learning; Social disorganization,"This study combines traditional statistical methods with machine learning to better understand locally relevant, contextual models for analyzing crime in two urban American cities. Using census tracts as the units of analysis and controlling for several structural characteristics associated with crime, we find that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, violent crime is associated with concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and spatial lag of violent crime. Yet, the most important variable is the spatial lag of violent crime, followed by residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and concentrated disadvantage. In addition, we find that in Chicago, Illinois, violent crime is associated with immigration, owner-occupied housing, proportion in professional occupations, and proportion population with college degree or higher, as well as ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and the spatial lag for violent crime. Machine learning models suggest that for Chicago's violent crime, the most important variable is the spatial lag term for violent crime, followed by total population, immigration, college education or beyond, owner occupancy, ethnic heterogeneity, and employment in professional occupations. The findings for property crime are similar: in Milwaukee, we find that disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population and spatial lag for property crime are significant predictors in the traditional regression models. However, the most important variable for property crime in Milwaukee is the spatial lag term, followed by total population, ethnic heterogeneity, residential stability and disadvantage. The statistically significant predictors of property crime in Chicago include immigration, owner-occupied housing units, living in the same house, proportion of workforce in professional occupations, college education and beyond, total population, and the spatial lag for property crime. In Chicago, the most important variable for property crime is the spatial lag term, then the total population, the proportion of individuals in professional occupations, concentrated immigration, college education and beyond, living in the same house, and the proportion of owner-occupied housing units. Urban planners must consider policies that can effectively reduce nearby crime and violence in all cities that experience high crime levels, but also design locally responsive policies that make sense within a local context: in Milwaukee, residential stability matters more for violent crime than for property crime, while in Chicago, total population is similarly important for both violent crime and property crime. In Milwaukee, ethnic heterogeneity is similarly important for violent and property crime, while in Chicago, ethnic heterogeneity is not a very important variable for violent crime and it is not a significant predictor of property crime. Therefore, urban policy must differently approach social disorganization indicators and support the nuances of the local context for urban planning and policy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,Cities,"Clancy K., Chudzik J., Snowden A.J., Guha S.",10.1016/j.cities.2022.103604,Article,4.8638710976,5.9741883278
6,2,,"Subjective or objective measures of street environment, which are more effective in explaining housing prices?",Human Perception; Property value; Street design qualities; Street view imagery; Subjective measures,"Houses with better street design are found to relate to a price premium. Prior studies mainly present the street quality using objective indicators like tree counts and distance to parks with land use data, or most recently using the greenery view index extracted from street view imagery (SVI). We argue objective indicators cannot completely describe people's sense of a place, as perception is a highly subjective process. We hypothesize that subjective measures using visual surveys could capture more subtle human perceptions, thus providing stronger predictive power to housing prices. However, the role of subjectively measured street design qualities is less known due to the lack of large-scale perception data. To test our hypothesis, we first collected designers’ perceptions on five urban design qualities from pairwise SVIs rankings in Shanghai with an online visual survey. Unlike the mainstream of using generic image features, we followed urban design theory and used rule-based features, i.e., about thirty streetscape elements extracted from SVIs to train machine learning (ML) models to predict subjective perceptions. The predictive power of five qualities versus ten selected individual streetscapes on housing price were compared using the hedonic price model. Besides the standard ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were also developed to account for the spatial dependence and heterogeneity effects. We found both subjectively measured design qualities and objective indicators outperformed housing structural attributes in explaining housing price. While the objective view indexes collectively explained more price variances, the five perceptions individually exhibited stronger strength. Third, less-studied perceptions like “human scale” showed stronger strength than commonly studied “safety” and “enclosure”. Fourth, less-studied view indexes like “person” and “fence” outperformed ubiquitous features like trees and buildings. Lastly, prior studies might have resulted in biased estimations due to ignoring the multicollinear issues between the sky, tree and building views. Our study addressed the effectiveness of incorporating subjective perceptions at a micro level to infer housing prices. correlations between subjective perceptions were strong while that of objective indicators were negligible, therefore subjective perceptions can complement the objective indicators. The findings provide important reference to decision makers when selecting street quality indicators to infer urban design, city planning and community and housing development plans. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Qiu W., Zhang Z., Liu X., Li W., Li X., Xu X., Huang X.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104358,Article,4.7126412392,5.8042259216000005
6,6,,Generative Adversarial Network Approach to Future Sermonizing of Housing Dispersal in Emerging Cities,Emerging cities; Generative adversarial network; Housing dispersal; Machine learning; Urban growth,"This study aims to visualize the future housing dispersal of expatriates, based on the predicted urban growth in emerging cities.

6,7,,Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to Modeling Residential Infill Development in the City of Los Angeles,,"While infill development is widely accepted by cities as an alternative to urban sprawl, a very dearth of research has attempted to measure infill development and identify contributing factors to infill development. Filling this research gap, this paper models residential infill development in the City of Los Angeles by employing five machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper attempts to identify the best-performing ML algorithms by comparing the performance of the ML algorithms. Of the five ML algorithms tested, the random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithms are selected as the best-performing algorithms. The RF algorithm ranks independent variables from most to least important. Overall, the ranks suggested that residential infill development in the City of Los Angeles is significantly influenced by the physical conditions of property and neighborhood rather than socioeconomic characteristics. Diverse land uses, good housing mixes, and rail transit accessibility also, importantly, contributed to the infill development. This finding suggests that the city's planning efforts, such as the promotion of accessory dwelling unit (ADU) development and the expansion of rail transit, can create a virtuous circle for sustainable urban development. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2022,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,"Kim D., Shim J., Park J., Cho J., Kumar S.",10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000787,Article,4.772769928,5.8721237183
6,11,,Urban Catchment-Scale Blue-Green-Gray Infrastructure Classification with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Images and Machine Learning Algorithms,blue infrastructure; classification; green infrastructure; machine learning; unmanned aerial vehicle images,"Green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, is now widely used in sustainable urban development. An accurate mapping of GI is important to provide surface parameterization for model development. However, the accuracy and precision of mapping GI is still a challenge in identifying GI at the small catchment scale. We proposed a framework for blue-green-gray infrastructure classification using machine learning algorithms and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that contained digital surface model (DSM) information. We used the campus of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, as a study case for our classification method. The UAV was a DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral, which measures the blue, green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared bands and DSM information. Six machine learning algorithms, i.e., fuzzy classifier, k-nearest neighbor classifier, Bayes classifier, classification and regression tree, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were used to classify blue (including water), green (including green roofs, grass, trees (shrubs), bare land), and gray (including buildings, roads) infrastructure. The highest kappa coefficient was observed for RF and the lowest was observed for SVM, with coefficients of 0.807 and 0.381, respectively. We optimized the sampling method based on a chessboard grid and got the optimal sampling interval of 11.6 m to increase the classification efficiency. We also analyzed the effects of weather conditions, seasons, and different image layers, and found that images in overcast days or winter days could improve the classification accuracy. In particular, the DSM layer was crucial for distinguishing green roofs and grass, and buildings and roads. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using UAV images in urban blue-green-gray infrastructure classification, and our infrastructure classification framework based on machine learning algorithms is effective. Our results could provide the basis for the future urban stormwater management model development and aid sustainable urban planning.

6,12,,Investigation of Airflow around Buildings using Large-Eddy Simulations for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Applications,,"The ever-increasing demand for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has led to the desire for integrating them into spaces in close proximity of humans like dense urban spaces, a reality previously thought of as inconceivable. One of the main concerns to be addressed before its widespread adoption is safety, especially in areas of operation adjacent to structures like buildings. This work investigates the effect of building geometries on the flow field in a simplified urban setup consisting of an isolated building to predict their potential impacts on UAS operations. Unanticipated wind gusts or turbulent flow conditions prevalent around various structures constitute a significant challenge for UAS operations in urban environments. We use Large-Eddy Simulation to better understand the unsteady and highly coherent turbulent flow structures produced by buildings in neutral atmospheric boundary layer flow. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a non-intrusive machine learning methodology to predict flow fields to augment safe wind-aware navigation systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a first step towards safely integrating UAS into existing aerial infrastructure. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

6,18,,Towards a Multi-agents Model for Automatic Big Data Processing to Support Urban Planning,Automation; Big data; Big data analytics; Decision-making; Machine learning; Multi-agent system; Smart data; Urban planning,"The objective of this paper was to propose a multi-agents model for automating big data processing, to improve the process of decision-making and urban planning. The huge amounts of collected data from different domains, such as urban management and remote sensing, are characterized as big data with a spatial component. Smart data is the approach to deal with big data characteristics and challenges by focusing on the Value aspect. The focus on smart data on the relevant data and the mechanism of automation and collaboration of the agents, will contribute to the efficient automating for big data analytics and processing. The proposed approach is based on a collection of agents, and adopt the concept of smart data, this paradigm focus on the aspect value from the big data and help to retrieve the useful information from the large volumes of data by intelligent processing. The proposed model describes the functionalities of the agents. The agents receive data in real time, perform the operations of storing data, pre-processing, streaming processing and batch processing and finally transfer the results of analysis to the services and applications. Machine learning techniques can be used to enhance the aspect of cognition of the agents; through a case study, we used supervised learning methods to build a classification model to support the process of urban planning by predicting the type of habitat adequate for the population based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,"Advances in Science, Technology and Innovation","Sassite F., Addou M., Barramou F.",10.1007/978-3-030-80458-9_1,Book Chapter,4.7915658951,6.0333871841
6,24,1.0,Urban soils as a spatial indicator of quality for urban socio-ecological systems,Andes; Cities; Environmental Quality; Machine learning; Volcanic urban soils,"The development of criteria and indicators to quantify the transition to sustainability of the urban socio-ecological systems quality is determinant for planning policies and the 21st century urban agenda. This study models the spatial variation in the concentration and distribution of some macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients in the soil of a high-altitude city in the Andes. Meanwhile, machine learning methods were employed to study some interactions between the different dimensions that constitute an urban socio-ecosystem that caused these variations. We proposed a methodology that considered two phases: a) field work to collect data on 300 soil samples; laboratory analysis to measure the concentrations of 24 macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients; and the design of geophysical, spectral, and urban co-variables; b) statistical and geo-informatics analysis, where multivariate analysis grouped the elements into factors; and, machine learning integrated with co-variables was applied to derive the intensity of each factor across the city. Multivariate statistics described the variation in soil co-concentrations with a moderate percentage (42%). Four factors were determined that grouped some of the analyzed elements, as follows: F1 (Zn, S, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr), F2 (Ba, Ag, K, In, and Mg), F3 (B, V, Li, and Sr), and F4 (Si and Mn). The percentage R2 out-of-bag of the spatial model were: F1 = 20%, F2 = 8%, F3 = 14%, and F4 = 10%. Our outputs show that the enrichment and contamination by anthropogenic factors, such as the increase in population density, land use, road network, and traffic generated by fossil fuel vehicles, should be prioritized in urban planning decisions. © 2021",2021,Journal of Environmental Management,"Bonilla-Bedoya S., López-Ulloa M., Mora-Garcés A., Macedo-Pezzopane J.E., Salazar L., Herrera M.Á.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113556,Article,4.7816720009,5.8494334221
6,25,,Data-based wildfire risk model for Mediterranean ecosystems-case study of the Concepción metropolitan area in central Chile,,"Wildfire risk is latent in Chilean metropolitan areas characterized by the strong presence of wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs). The Concepción metropolitan area (CMA) constitutes one of the most representative samples of that dynamic. The wildfire risk in the CMA was addressed by establishing a model of five categories (near zero, low, moderate, high, and very high) that represent discernible thresholds in fire occurrence, using geospatial data and satellite images describing anthropic-biophysical factors that trigger fires. Those were used to deliver a model of fire hazard using machine learning algorithms, including principal component analysis and Kohonen self-organizing maps in two experimental scenarios: Only native forest and only forestry plantation. The model was validated using fire hotspots obtained from the forestry government organization. The results indicated that 12.3% of the CMA's surface area has a high and very high risk of a forest fire, 29.4% has a moderate risk, and 58.3% has a low and very low risk. Lastly, the observed main drivers that have deepened this risk were discussed: First, the evident proximity between the increasing urban areas with exotic forestry plantations and, second, climate change that threatens triggering more severe and large wildfires because of human activities. © 2021 Edilia Jaque Castillo et al.",2021,Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,"Jaque Castillo E., Fernández A., Fuentes Robles R., Ojeda C.G.",10.5194/nhess-21-3663-2021,Article,4.6980414391,5.9592504501
6,29,,Classification of the influence of urban canyon geometry and reflectance on seasonal solar irradiation in three European cities,Classification; Machine Learning; Reflectance; Simulation; Solar radiation; Urban canyon,"The study presents a methodological framework for simulating, analyzing and classifying the seasonal solar exposure and irradiation uniformity of symmetrical urban canyons in three European cities with different latitudes: Athens, Paris and Helsinki. Parametric solar radiation simulations are conducted by varying the urban canyon geometry, orientation and surface reflectance. The study proposes the Solar Irradiation Ratio (SIR) and develops a qualitative classification scheme for solar exposure and irradiation uniformity in order to compare simulation results from different cities and label each urban canyon surface accordingly. Finally, the study trains and tests Random Forest classifiers which enable the quick classification of any symmetrical canyon geometry by providing canyon geometry, orientation and surface reflectance as inputs. Testing reveals that the classifiers have decent performance (accuracy: 0.89 – 0.94, precision: 0.82 – 0.92) and consequently may be used in early urban design and planning studies to get a quick estimate of the solar performance of a given symmetrical urban canyon, before full-scale simulations take place. © 2021",2021,Sustainable Cities and Society,Vartholomaios A.,10.1016/j.scs.2021.103379,Article,4.5955815315,6.0165524483
6,35,2.0,Mapping fine-scale visual quality distribution inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR data,Fine-scale; Machine learning; Mobile LiDAR; Urban street; Visual quality,"The visual quality of urban streets is of vital importance for establishing a satisfying and comfortable experience for the residents in an urban community. It also has positive effects on urban vibrancy, public health, and social connections in that community. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the visual quality at the urban street level using street view images. However, the spatial distribution of fine-grained visual quality inside an urban street is rarely investigated. This study presents a new approach for the evaluation of visual quality inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR point clouds. The semantic information of urban streets was first extracted from mobile LiDAR point clouds with a Gradient Boosting classifier. After that, seven well-known key design elements, including the green space factor, sky view factor, enclosure rate, volume index, vehicle occurrence rate, motorization rate, and diversity, were calculated from the classified point clouds using a three-dimensional (3D) visibility model. Finally, the visual quality at 1 m grid resolution inside urban street was achieved automatically by using a random forest model which was trained based on perception samples. This approach has been validated on two study areas and the results indicated that the proposed approach is able to quantitatively examine the visual quality difference inside urban streets. The results generated by the proposed method also match well with the common sense of urban design experts, which are useful for architects and designers to develop best practices in the urban micro-renewal project and to refine the urban planning processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,Building and Environment,"Wu B., Yu B., Shu S., Liang H., Zhao Y., Wu J.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108323,Article,4.8523392677,5.7999162674
6,36,,Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation and Prediction from Socioeconomic Variables Using Automatic Feature Selection Procedure-Based Machine Learning Model,Artificial neural networks; Feature selection; Machine learning; Origin-destination (OD) matrix; Support vector machines; Urban transport planning,"The origin-destination (OD) demand matrix plays an essential role in travel modeling and transport planning. Traditional OD matrices are estimated from expensive and laborious traffic counts and surveys. Accordingly, this study proposes a new combined methodology to estimate or update OD matrices (urban mobility) directly from easy-to-obtain and free-of-charge socioeconomic variables. The Málaga region, Spain, was used as a case study. The proposed methodology involves two stages. First, an automatic feature selection procedure was developed to determine the most relevant socioeconomic variables, discarding the irrelevant ones. Several feature selection techniques were studied and combined. Second, machine learning (ML) models were used to estimate mobility between predefined zones. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR) were tested and compared using the most relevant variables as inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model can be more accurate than traditional methods and ML models without the feature selection procedure. In particular, SVR with feature selection slightly outperformed the combined model using ANNs. The proposed methodology can be a promising and affordable alternative method for estimating OD matrices, reducing costs and lead time significantly, and assisting and improving urban transport planning. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2021,Journal of Urban Planning and Development,"Rodríguez-Rueda P.J., Ruiz-Aguilar J.J., González-Enrique J., Turias I.",10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000763,Article,4.8579540253,5.8971476555
6,41,,National Empirical Models of Air Pollution Using Microscale Measures of the Urban Environment,Empirical models; exposure assessment; machine learning; street-level features; urban form,"National-scale empirical models of air pollution (e.g., Land Use Regression) rely on predictor variables (e.g., population density, land cover) at different geographic scales. These models typically lack microscale variables (e.g., street level), which may improve prediction with fine-spatial gradients. We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K). We compared predictor variables (e.g., traditional vs microscale) and emerging modeling approaches (ML-K) to well-established approaches (i.e., traditional variables in a PLS-K or SW-K framework). We found that combined predictor variables (traditional + microscale) in the ML-K models outperformed the well-established approaches (10-fold spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 increased 0.02-0.42 [average: 0.19] among six criteria pollutants). Comparing all model types using microscale variables to models with traditional variables, the performance is similar (average difference of 10-fold spatial CV R2 = 0.05) suggesting microscale variables are a suitable substitute for traditional variables. ML-K and microscale variables show promise for improving national empirical models. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",2021,Environmental Science and Technology,"Lu T., Marshall J.D., Zhang W., Hystad P., Kim S.-Y., Bechle M.J., Demuzere M., Hankey S.",10.1021/acs.est.1c04047,Article,4.7620396614,5.8347611427

Among the data collection media, Multi-Spectral Imagery (MSI) from the Sentinel-2 satellite, the primary road system, and a sample of direct observation points, were used. The processed data were incorporated into georeferenced maps, to which urban limits and official slopes were added.

6,43,1.0,An end-to-end point of interest (Poi) conflation framework,Data conflation; Data fusion; Data integration; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Volunteered geographic information,"Point of interest (POI) data serves as a valuable source of semantic information for places of interest and has many geospatial applications in real estate, transportation, and urban planning. With the availability of different data sources, POI conflation serves as a valuable technique for enriching data quality and coverage by merging the POI data from multiple sources. This study proposes a novel end-to-end POI conflation framework consisting of six steps, starting with data procurement, schema standardisation, taxonomy mapping, POI matching, POI unification, and data verification. The feasibility of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study conducted in the eastern region of Singapore, where the POI data from five data sources was conflated to form a unified POI dataset. Based on the evaluation conducted, the resulting unified dataset was found to be more comprehensive and complete than any of the five POI data sources alone. Furthermore, the proposed approach for identifying POI matches between different data sources outperformed all baseline approaches with a matching accuracy of 97.6% with an average run time below 3 min when matching over 12,000 POIs to result in 8699 unique POIs, thereby demonstrating the framework’s scalability for large scale implementation in dense urban contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

6,47,1.0,Prediction of crime rate in urban neighborhoods based on machine learning,Big data analysis; Crime rate; Machine learning; Urban design,"As the impact of crime on the lives of residents has increased, there are a number of methods for predicting where crime will occur. They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan. In addition the ideas in this paper can be applied as a set of methodologies to predict other relevant urban characteristic parameters and visualize them. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,"He J., Zheng H.",10.1016/j.engappai.2021.104460,Article,4.8779630661,6.0303092003

Most developed cities have suffered from severe air quality as population growth and industrialization grow rapidly. Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods. © 2021",2021,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,"Liu L., Zhang Y.",10.1016/j.seta.2021.101425,Article,4.7182784081,5.8669438362
6,65,,Application of random forest and shap tree explainer in exploring spatial (In)justice to aid urban planning,Economic mobility; Geographic information systems; Random forest classifier; SHAP tree explainer; Spatial justice,"In light of recent local, national, and global events, spatial justice provides a potentially powerful lens by which to explore a multitude of spatial inequalities. For more than two decades, scholars have been espousing the power of this concept to help develop more equitable and just communities. However, defining spatial justice and developing a methodology for quantitatively an-alyzing it is complicated and no agreed upon metric for examining spatial justice has been developed. Instead, individual measures of spatial injustices have been studied. One such individual measure is economic mobility. Recent research on economic mobility has revealed the importance of local geography on upward mobility and may serve as an important keystone in developing a metric for multiple place-based issues of spatial inequality. This paper seeks to explore place-based variables within individual census tracts in an effort to understand their impact on economic mobility and potentially spatial justice. The methodology relies on machine learning techniques and the results show that the best performing model is able to predict economic mobility of a census tract based on its spatial variables with 86% accuracy. The availability and density of jobs, compactness of the area, and the presence of medical facilities and underground storage tanks have the greatest influence, whereas some of the influential features are positively while the others are negatively associated. In the end, this research will allow for comparative analysis between differing geographies and also identify leading variables in the overall quest for spatial justice. © 2021 by the authors.

Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction. © 2021",2021,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Rosés R., Kadar C., Malleson N.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101660,Article,4.8823699951,6.0205712318

Istanbul has been experiencing rapid urban expansion for the past 60 years. This urban expansion is leading to the replacement of forests by various artificial surfaces. This situation has a critical impact on the natural surfaces due to the alteration of heat energy balance. In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3 km2, and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260 km2. Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years. © 2021, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).",2021,Applied Geomatics,"Khorrami B., Heidarlou H.B., Feizizadeh B.",10.1007/s12518-020-00350-3,Article,4.6571903229,5.8769712448
6,75,,Ai augmented approach to identify shared ideas from large format public consultation,City; Data analysis; Natural language processing; Public participation; Urban planning,"Public data, contributed by citizens, stakeholders and other potentially affected parties, are becoming increasingly used to collect the shared ideas of a wider community. Having collected large quantities of text data from public consultation, the challenge is often how to interpret the dataset without resorting to lengthy time-consuming manual analysis. One approach gaining ground is the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Based on machine learning technology applied to analysis of human natural languages, NLP provides the opportunity to automate data analysis for large volumes of texts at a scale that would be virtually impossible to analyse manually. Using NLP toolkits, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying and visualising shared ideas from large format public consultation. The approach analyses grammatical structures of public texts to discover shared ideas from sentences comprising subject + verb + object and verb + object that express public options. In particular, the shared ideas are identified by extracting noun, verb, adjective phrases and clauses from subjects and objects, which are then categorised by urban infrastructure categories and terms. The results are visualised in a hierarchy chart and a word tree using cascade and tree views. The approach is illustrated using data collected from a public consultation exercise called “Share an Idea” undertaken in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the 2011 earthquake. The approach has the potential to upscale public participation to identify shared design values and associated qualities for a wide range of public initiatives including urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent advances in remote sensing and social sensing data and methods have shown great potentials in mapping urban land use categories, but they are still constrained by mixed land uses, limited predictors, non-localized models, and often relatively low accuracies. To inform these issues, we proposed a robust and cost-effective framework for mapping urban land use categories using openly available multi-source geospatial “big data”. With street blocks generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the minimum classification unit, we integrated an expansive set of multi-scale spatially explicit information on land surface, vertical height, socio-economic attributes, social media, demography, and topography. We further proposed to apply the automatic ensemble learning that leverages a bunch of machine learning algorithms in deriving optimal urban land use classification maps. Results of block-level urban land use classification in five metropolitan areas of the United States found the overall accuracies of major-class (Level-I) and minor-class (Level-II) classification could be high as 91% and 86%, respectively. A multi-model comparison revealed that for urban land use classification with high-dimensional features, the multi-layer stacking ensemble models achieved better performance than base models such as random forest, extremely randomized trees, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks. We found without very-high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery, the classification results derived from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and other open big data based features could achieve plausible overall accuracies of Level-I and Level-II classification at 88% and 81%, respectively. We also found that model transferability depended highly on the heterogeneity in characteristics of different regions. The methods and findings in this study systematically elucidate the role of data sources, classification methods, and feature transferability in block-level land use classifications, which have important implications for mapping multi-scale essential urban land use categories. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The quality of the first phase, i.e. trip generation, determines the performance of the global course. The majority of trip generation forecasting models highly rely on mathematical derivation and have many predictor variables during the prediction, which leads to low accuracy of results and requires laboriously hand-crafted design of input vectors. This paper is the first to introduce the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm for trip generation prediction, and harmonizes such a powerful machine learning method with traditional urban planning requirements to achieve better prediction performance. Unlike the commonly used linear regression method, GBDT can automatically perform feature selection and model the non-linear relationships between input and output variables.

The ever-increasing global capture of cities in 360◦ provides considerable new opportunities for data-driven urban research. This paper provides the first comprehensive, state-of-the-art review on the use of street-level imagery for urban analysis in five research areas: built environment and land use; health and wellbeing; natural environment; urban modelling and demographic surveillance; and area quality and reputation. Panoramic street-level imagery provides advantages in comparison to remotely sensed imagery and conventional urban data sources, whether manual, automated, or machine learning data extraction techniques are applied. Key advantages include low-cost, rapid, high-resolution, and wide-scale data capture, enhanced safety through remote presence, and a unique pedestrian/vehicle point of view for analyzing cities at the scale and perspective in which they are experienced. However, several limitations are evident, including limited ability to capture attribute information, unreliability for temporal analyses, limited use for depth and distance analyses, and the role of corporations as image-data gatekeepers.

6,91,,Sustainable development scale of housing estates: An economic assessment using machine learning approach,density; housing; machine learning; threshold; urban planning,"Economic sustainability is often addressed from the perspective of economic growth and at the national level. In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,Sustainable Development,"Tang B.-S., Ho W.K.O., Wong S.W.",10.1002/sd.2168,Article,4.7509498596,5.8414011002
6,95,1.0,Urban morphological feature extraction and multi-dimensional similarity analysis based on deep learning approaches,Cluster analysis; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Similarity analysis; Urban morphology,"The study of urban morphology contributes to the evolution of cities and sustainable development. Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots’ figure–ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences. This work could serve as a basis for further typo-morphology studies and other morphology-related ecological, social, and economic studies for sustainable built environments. © 2021 by the authors.

6,97,,MetaStore: A task-adaptative meta-learning model for optimal store placement with multi-city knowledge transfer,Knowledge transfer; Machine learning; Meta-learning; Optimal store placement; Urban computing,"Optimal store placement aims to identify the optimal location for a new brick-and-mortar store that can maximize its sale by analyzing and mining users' preferences from large-scale urban data. In recent years, the expansion of chain enterprises in new cities brings some challenges because of two aspects: (1) data scarcity in new cities, so most existing models tend to not work (i.e., overfitting), because the superior performance of these works is conditioned on large-scale training samples; (2) data distribution discrepancy among different cities, so knowledge learned from other cities cannot be utilized directly in new cities. In this article, we propose a task-adaptative model-agnostic meta-learning framework, namely, MetaStore, to tackle these two challenges and improve the prediction performance in new cities with insufficient data for optimal store placement, by transferring prior knowledge learned from multiple data-rich cities. Specifically, we develop a task-adaptative meta-learning algorithm to learn city-specific prior initializations from multiple cities, which is capable of handling the multimodal data distribution and accelerating the adaptation in new cities compared to other methods. In addition, we design an effective learning strategy for MetaStore to promote faster convergence and optimization by sampling high-quality data for each training batch in view of noisy data in practical applications.

Prior studies have used various approaches to model housing rent, such as interpolation, hedonic modeling, and machine learning. However, only a few studies have modeled rental prices based on textual data, which provides rich and contextual information about rental properties. In addition, many models, especially deep learning models, use an end-to-end black box for prediction, which hides the decision process. Such models are difficult to interpret and explain the driving factors. This study builds on our previous work, aiming to develop and evaluate rental market spatial dynamics models combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and self-attention mechanism. We compare the performance of the proposed model with our previous models on predicting rental prices in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. We also use techniques from saliency maps to explain the generated model. Results show that the self-attention-based model outperforms our previous models. The saliency map techniques reveal how the model attends to a different part of the textual information. The predicted results reflect the spatial variation of textual information.

Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. © 2021 The Authors",2021,Water Research,"Ward B.J., Andriessen N., Tembo J.M., Kabika J., Grau M., Scheidegger A., Morgenroth E., Strande L.",10.1016/j.watres.2021.116997,Article,4.7269644737,5.7826113701

It presents a proposal for shifting from a traditional approach for generating general-purpose one-size-fits-all geodemographic classifications to application-specific classifications. This proposal addresses the recent scepticism towards the utility of general-purpose applications by employing supervised machine learning techniques in order to identify contextually relevant input variables from which to develop geodemographic classifications with increased discriminatory power. A framework introducing such techniques in the variable selection phase of geodemographic classification development is presented via a practical use-case that is focused on generating a geodemographic classification with an increased capacity for discriminating the propensity for Library use in the UK city of Leeds. Two local classifications are generated for the city, one a general-purpose classification, and the other, an application-specific classification incorporating supervised Feature Selection methods in the selection of input variables. The discriminatory power of each classification is evaluated and compared, with the result successfully demonstrating the capacity for the application-specific approach to generate a more contextually relevant result, and thus underpins increasingly targeted public policy decision making, particularly in the context of urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

6,113,1.0,A refined method of high-resolution remote sensing change detection based on machine learning for newly constructed building areas,Areas registration; Change detection; Deep learning; High-resolution remote sensing; Newly constructed building areas; SVM,"Automatic detection of newly constructed building areas (NCBAs) plays an important role in addressing issues of ecological environment monitoring, urban management, and urban planning. Compared with low-and-middle resolution remote sensing images, high-resolution remote sensing images are superior in spatial resolution and display of refined spatial details. Yet its problems of spectral heterogeneity and complexity have impeded research of change detection for high-resolution remote sensing images. As generalized machine learning (including deep learning) technologies proceed, the efficiency and accuracy of recognition for ground-object in remote sensing have been substantially improved, providing a new solution for change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images. To this end, this study proposes a refined NCBAs detection method consisting of four parts based on generalized machine learning: (1) pre-processing; (2) candidate NCBAs are obtained by means of bi-temporal building masks acquired by deep learning semantic segmentation, and then registered one by one; (3) rules and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly adopted for classification of NCBAs with high, medium and low confidence; and (4) the final vectors of NCBAs are obtained by post-processing. In addition, area-based and pixel-based methods are adopted for accuracy assessment. Firstly, the proposed method is applied to three groups of GF1 images covering the urban fringe areas of Jinan, whose experimental results are divided into three categories: high, high-medium, and high-medium-low confidence. The results show that NCBAs of high confidence share the highest F1 score and the best overall effect. Therefore, only NCBAs of high confidence are considered to be the final detection result by this method. Specifically, in NCBAs detection for three groups GF1 images in Jinan, the mean Recall of area-based and pixel-based assessment methods reach around 77% and 91%, respectively, the mean Pixel Accuracy (PA) 88% and 92%, and the mean F1 82% and 91%, confirming the effectiveness of this method on GF1. Similarly, the proposed method is applied to two groups of ZY302 images in Xi’an and Kunming. The scores of F1 for two groups of ZY302 images are also above 90% respectively, confirming the effectiveness of this method on ZY302. It can be concluded that adoption of area registration improves registration efficiency, and the joint use of prior rules and SVM classifier with probability features could avoid over and missing detection for NCBAs. In practical applications, this method is contributive to automatic NCBAs detection from high-resolution remote sensing images. © 2021 by the authors.

The awareness is growing that the urban development potential (‘magnetism’) of cities is closely related to safety and security conditions in these cities. This paper develops a new analytical framework based on a wealth of empirical data on both safety/security and socio-economic magnetism achievements of many world cities, by combining two comprehensive relevant global urban data bases. The aim of the study is to offer a comparative analysis of the combined safety/security data and socio-economic performance data of 30 global cities, through the use of an advanced sequential cluster dynamics analysis that is (partly) inspired by a novel machine learning approach (using Python software). In this way, cities can be categorized according to their quantitative characteristic features represented by the relevant clusters. It appears that city safety/security features are an important predictor of the variability in overall urban performance regarding magnetism.

Vehicle detection and counting have various other applications like traffic management, parking allotment, tracking the rescue vehicle in hill areas, digital watermarking, vehicle tracking at the toll plaza and urban planning, etc. However, vehicle detection and counting task are very challenging and difficult because of the complex background, the small size of the vehicle, other similar visual appearance objects, distance, etc. Till now, traditional methodology introduced several robust algorithms which has limitations while extracting the features from aerial images. Recently, deep learning-based algorithms introduced and the outcomes of these algorithms are robust for such kind of applications in the area of computer vision. But accuracy of these algorithms is not optimized in aerial images because the deep learning algorithm required a huge amount of data to train the machine and the size of the object in aerial images is also too small. All these factors affecting the efficiency of the real-time device. This paper provides a brief description of traditional algorithms as well as machine learning and deep learning concepts to identifying the object through aerial images. The study has shown the comprehensive analysis of benchmark datasets and their parameters and corresponding challenges used by researchers and scientists in the area of object detection/tracking through aerial images. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,"Proceedings - IEEE 2021 International Conference on Computing, Communication, and Intelligent Systems, ICCCIS 2021","Kumar S., Rajan E.G., Rani S.",10.1109/ICCCIS51004.2021.9397116,Conference Paper,4.8165616989,5.9012799263
6,133,,Applying machine learning and geolocation techniques to social media data (Twitter) to develop a resource for urban planning,,"With all the recent attention focused on big data, it is easy to overlook that basic vital statistics remain difficult to obtain in most of the world. What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012–2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments. © 2021 Milusheva et al.

6,140,,A glimpse into the future of exposure and vulnerabilities in cities? Modelling of residential location choice of urban population with random forest,,"The most common approach to assessing natural hazard risk is investigating the willingness to pay in the presence or absence of such risk. In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus. Avenues for future research include the operational strengthening of these linkages for more effective disaster risk management. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

6,156,,Human Origin-Destination Flow Prediction Based on Large Scale Mobile Signal Data,,"The human origin-destination (OD) flow prediction is of great significance for urban safety control, stampede prevention, disease transmission control, urban planning, and many other aspects. Most of the existing methods generally divide the urban area into grids and use vehicle GPS trajectories and metrocard check-in data, combined with machine learning or deep learning models to predict human OD flow. However, these kinds of methods are challenging to capture fine-grained human mobility patterns. Moreover, these methods usually deviate from the actual human OD transfer patterns on a citywide scale due to the particularity of different datasets. To this end, in this paper, we use large-scale mobile phone signal data to achieve human OD flow prediction between the coverage of varying signal base stations. Many signal base stations are distributed in urban geographical space, collecting all the mobile phone user's location information to obtain large-scale fine-grained unbiased human OD flow data. Due to the lack of natural topology structure between base stations, this paper adopts a TGCN model combined with a graph fusion module to pretrain the dynamic population distribution prediction task. The parameters of the graph fusion module are employed to capture the different semantic information in the proposed hybrid machine learning method and finally achieve citywide human OD flow prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world signal datasets in Changchun, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. © 2021 Qiuyang Huang et al.",2021,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,"Huang Q., Yang Y., Xu Y., Wang E., Zhu K.",10.1155/2021/1604268,Article,4.8394694328,5.896378994
6,157,,From sonic experiences to urban planning innovations,crowdsourcing; smart cities; Soundscape research; tool support; urban planning,"It is widely accepted that personal responses to soundscapes are more dependent on listeners’ emotions and attitudes, than on sounds or their physical features alone. Fast-growing cities have catalyzed the importance of designing urban spaces that citizens find pleasant and homely and that support a communal style of living. Unfortunately, there are no standardized methods or techniques to translate sonic experiences into measurable and reliable data, which urban planning professionals or the building industry could turn into innovations and solutions. Most of the data pertaining to noise pollution and city soundscapes is still based on predictive acoustic models and rarely takes any real-life experiences or physical measurements into consideration. This paper presents the concept of a smart and participatory approach for gathering sonic experiences that could be translated into measurable values. The aim is to search for data collection methods to provide data to train deep learning. With machine learning methods, it is possible to find patterns in both desirable and undesirable urban soundscapes. The aim of this concept is to create crowdsourced data collection methods and improve the understanding and communication between citizens and planning processes by producing more accurate and comparable experiential data. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,European Planning Studies,"Kaarivuo A., Salo K., Mikkonen T.",10.1080/09654313.2021.1988062,Article,4.8024721146000005,5.8998966217

Heavy traffic, unexpected geohazards are some of the effects of uncontrollable development. This situation points its fingerto urban planning and design; there are numerous automation tools to help urban planners assess and forecast, yet unplanned development still occurs, impeding sustainability. Automation tools use machine learning classification models to analyze spatial data and various trend views before planning a new urban development. Although there are many sophisticated tools and massive datasets, big cities with colossal migration still witness traffic jams, pollution, and environmental degradation affecting urban dwellers’ quality. This study will analyze the current predictors in urban planning machine learning models and identify the suitable predictors to support sustainable urban planning. A correct set of predictors could improve the efficiency of the urban development classification models and help urban planners to enhance the quality of life in big cities. © 2021.

An increasing part of the world’s population lives in urban areas, where contact with nature is largely reduced to street trees and parks. As optional tree planting sites and financial resources are limited, determining the best planting site can be formulated as an optimization problem with constraints. Can we locate these sites based on the popularity of nearby venues? How can we ensure that we include groups of people who tend to spend time in tree deprived areas? Currently, tree location sites are chosen based on criteria from spatial-visual, physical and biological, and functional categories. As these criteria do not give any insights into which citizens are benefiting from the tree placement, we propose new data-driven tree planting policies that take socio-cultural aspects as represented by the citizens’ behavior into account. We combine a Location Based Social Network (LBSN) mobility data set with tree location data sets, both of New York City and Paris, as a case study. The effect of four different policies is evaluated on simulated movement data and assessed on the average, overall exposure to trees as well as on how much inequality in tree exposure is mitigated. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,Communications in Computer and Information Science,"van Staalduinen J.H., Tetteroo J., Gawehns D., Baratchi M.",10.1007/978-3-030-76640-5_10,Conference Paper,4.8289732933,5.8463120460999995

Land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) have facilitated a wide spectrum of applications and further triggered new opportunities in urban studies. New and improved Earth observations, algorithms, and advanced products for extracting thematic urban information, in association with emerging social sensing big data and auxiliary crowdsourcing datasets, all together offer great potentials to mapping fine-resolution EULUC from regional to global scales. Here we review the advances of EULUC mapping research and practices in terms of their data, methods, and applications. Based on the historical retrospect, we summarize the challenges and limitations of current EULUC studies regarding sample collection, mixed land use problem, data and model generalization, and large-scale mapping efforts. Finally, we propose and discuss future opportunities, including cross-scale mapping, optimal integration of multi-source features, global sample libraries from crowdsourcing approaches, advanced machine learning and ensembled classification strategy, open portals for data visualization and sharing, multi-temporal mapping of EULUC change, and implications in urban environmental studies, to facilitate multi-scale fine-resolution EULUC mapping research. © 2021 The Author(s).

Model performance can be improved by integrating exogenous features from open data repositories (e.g., weather, housing prices, traffic, etc.), but these uncurated sources are often too noisy, incomplete, and biased to use directly. We propose to learn integrated representations, called EquiTensors, from heterogeneous datasets that can be reused across a variety of tasks. We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with ""oracle""models that use hand-selected datasets. © 2021 ACM.",2021,Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data,"Yan A., Howe B.",10.1145/3448016.3452777,Conference Paper,4.836016655,6.0660276413

Although they perform important functions, research focuses on large cities and metropolises while marginalizing small cities, the study of which is of great importance to progress in social sciences, geography, and urban planning. The main goal of this paper was to verify the impact of selected socio-economic factors on the share of built-up areas in 665 small Polish cities in 2019. Data from the Database of Topographic Objects (BDOT), Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from 2015 and 2019, and Local Data Bank by Statistics Poland form 2019 were used in the research. A machine learning segmentation procedure was used to obtain the data on the occurrence of built-up areas. Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explain spatially varying impact of factors related to population, spatial and economic development, and living standards on the share of built-up areas in the area of small cities. Significant association was found between the population density and the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities studied. The influence of the other socio-economic factors examined, related to the spatial and economic development of the cities and the quality of life of the inhabitants, showed great regional variation. The results also indicated that the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities under study is a result of the conditions under which they were established and developed throughout their existence, and not only of the socio-economic factors affecting them at present. © 2021 by the authors.

The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score.

This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata model uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical flood hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations. Our work shows that coproduced scenarios, when grounded with historical and emerging data, can provide paths that increase resilience to weather hazards as well as enhancing ecosystem services provided to citizens. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2021,Urban Book Series,"Ortiz L., Mustafa A., Rosenzweig B., McPhearson T.",10.1007/978-3-030-63131-4_9,Book Chapter,4.7070612907000005,5.9720392227

We used a machine learning-based workflow to predict high resolution (30 m) and sub-daily atmospheric variables fields of near-surface air temperature and humidity, and wind speed. The method used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition applied on ground stations observations or Global Climate Model (GCM) residual error, in a sequence with bias correction and statistical models (Linear Regression-LR, Artificial Neural Network model-ANN and Empirical Quantile Mapping-EQM) to provide downscaling from large scale atmospheric conditions to complex terrain variability. The predictions described relationships of Principal Component (PC) scores dependent on GCM temporal variability on 6-hourly basis (with LR or ANN or EQM), and PC loadings dependent on topographic indexes to help providing horizontal sub-grid extrapolation. The methods were validated with a 1-year dataset from a dense weather stations network deployed in a complex terrain basin in tropical climate of Southeast Brazil. We present an exhaustive description of the PC modes daily/seasonal variability for each variable, and their spatial variability associated to the topography and thermal driven circulations. The predictions in general substantially improved accuracy when compared to GCM outputs, especially near the valley and in sheltered area where local effects are mandatories.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",2020,Urban Forestry and Urban Greening,"Tang Z., Ye Y., Jiang Z., Fu C., Huang R., Yao D.",10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126871,Article,4.7790970802,5.8059053421

Many downstream applications require comprehensive analysis like geographic information retrieval, recommender systems, geographic knowledge graphs, and in general, understanding urban spaces [28]. Points of Interests (POI), as one of the most researched aspects of urban data, has been successfully modeled using concepts borrowed from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the work of Place2Vec [28], a Word2Vec-like statistical model is proposed to represent spatial adjacency with a continuous embedding space. This method successfully models the functional semantics of POIs with regard to several human-assessment based evaluations. However, though the Place2Vec model addresses the distributional heterogeneity within a given spatial context with ITDL augmentation, it does not address the spatial heterogeneity among different regions. To solve this problem, we propose to introduce a hierarchical, density-based, self-adjusting clustering mechanism. The boundary of relatedness and unrelatedness is learned from the given context, where denser areas have tighter bounds while sparser areas have looser ones. We train our model on both the baseline Yelp hierarchical dataset [28] and our OpenStreetMap dataset. We demonstrate that 1) our model significantly improves the performance on 2 of the 3 baseline tasks and the stability of training, and 2) our model generalizes excellently across 112 cities of radically different scales (minimum 1725 POIs, maximum 2694070 POIs), regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa) and types (commercial, touristy, industrial, etc.) without the need of adjusting or tuning any hyperparameters.

This study uses the large inflow of immigrants in Barcelona between 1998 and 2008 to study whether the configuration of buildings and open urban areas in a block is associated with the residential segregation of immigrants—a proxy for social interaction. Based on a rich set of shape metrics, I use machine learning techniques to classify each block in Barcelona into one of eight typologies, which provide a summary measure of their built environment. I then combine these data with measures of residential segregation constructed at the building level using data on the exact address of each resident of Barcelona. The findings show that some features of the built environment of a block—as measured by the typologies—are systematically associated with reduced residential segregation of Spaniards and newly arrived immigrants in that block. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,Cities,Salazar Miranda A.,10.1016/j.cities.2020.102852,Article,4.7998113632,6.0133957863

This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity. These findings hold implications for urban planning and water distribution design to mitigate potential cascading failures. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2020,Journal of Infrastructure Systems,"Abdel-Mottaleb N., Zhang Q.",10.1061/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000563,Article,4.6922898293,5.9563121796

Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation's companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,Future Generation Computer Systems,"Bencke L., Cechinel C., Munoz R.",10.1016/j.future.2020.03.057,Article,4.7518105507,5.995660305
6,241,,A deep learning approach to urban street functionality prediction based on centrality measures and stacked denoising autoencoder,Centrality measures; Deep learning; Machine learning; Stacked denoising autoencoder; Street functionality classification; Urban transportation network,"In urban planning and transportation management, the centrality characteristics of urban streets are vital measures to consider. Centrality can help in understanding the structural properties of dense traffic networks that affect both human life and activity in cities. Many cities classify urban streets to provide stakeholders with a group of street guidelines for possible new rehabilitation such as sidewalks, curbs, and setbacks. Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments. In our work, a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) predicts a street's functionality, then logistic regression is used as a classifier. Our proposed classifier can differentiate between four different classes adopted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT): principal arterial road, minor arterial road, collector road, and local road. The SDAE-based model showed that regular grid configurations with repeated patterns are more influential in forming the functionality of road networks compared to those with less regularity in their spatial structure. © 2020 by the authors.

Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design. This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO's utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices. © 2020 ACM.",2020,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,"Feygin S.A., Lazarus J.R., Forscher E.H., Golfier-Vetterli V., Lee J.W., Gupta A., Waraich R.A., Sheppard C.J.R., Bayen A.M.",10.1145/3384344,Article,4.7460646629,5.985783577
6,267,,Machine learning for comparative urban planning at scale: An aviation case study,,"Aviation is in flux, experiencing 5.4% yearly growth over the last two decades. However, with COVID-19 aviation was hard hit. This, along with its contribution to global warming, has led to louder calls to limit its use. This situation emphasizes how urban planners and technologists could contribute to understanding and responding to this change. This paper explores a novel workflow of performing image-based machine learning (ML) on satellite images of over 1.000 world airports that were algonthmically collated using European Space Agency Sentinel2 API. From these, the top 350 United States airports were analyzed with land use parameters extracted around the airport using computer vision, which were mapped against their passenger footfall numbers. The results demonstrate a scalable approach to identify how easy and beneficial it would be for certain airports to expand or contract and how this would impact the surrounding urban environment in terms of pollution and congestion. The generic nature of this workflow makes it possible to potentially extend this method to any large infrastructure and compare and analyze specific features across a large number of images while being able to understand the same feature through time. This is critical in answering key typology-based urban design challenges at a higher level and without needing to perform on-ground studies, which could be expensive and time-consuming. © Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

6,271,,Anxious Landscapes,,"Advances in the field of machine learning over the last decade have revolutionized artificial intelligence by providing a flexible means to build analytic, predictive, and generative models from large datasets. but the allied design disciplines have yet to apply these tools at the urban level to draw analytic insights on how the built environment might impact human health. Previous research has found numerous correlations between the built environment and both physical and mental health outcomes-suggesting that the design of our cities may have significant impacts on human health. Developing methods of analysis that can provide insight on the correlations between the built environment and human health could help the allied design disciplines shape our cities in ways that promote human health. This research addresses these issues and contributes knowledge on the use of deep learning (DL) methods for urban analysis and mental health, specifically anxiety. Mental health disorders, such as anxiety, have been estimated to account for the largest proportion of global disease burden. The methods presented allow architects, planners, and urban designers to make use of large remote-sensing datasets (e.g.. satellite and aerial images) for design workflows involving analysis and generative design tasks. The research also contributes insight on correlations between anxiety prevalence and specific urban design features-providing actionable intelligence for the planning and design of the urban fabric. © Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

Managing the urban economy needs to consider environmental restrictions, environmental monitoring tasks, engineering facilities, and transport. Operational control over the urban environment and the surrounding area can be produced using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the collected data can be processed using a wide range of software and hardware technologies related to the field of artificial intelligence. However, along with any fairly new technology, intelligent unmanned technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. Strengths are mobility and efficiency, relative cheapness, the possibility of a high degree of automation, whereas weaknesses are short flight time, dependence on weather conditions, the certain outstanding tasks of data management and processing. This paper considers the possibilities of using intelligent unmanned technologies based on UAVs for solving the problems of monitoring the urban environment of the Kazakhstan megalopolises. Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles. Furthermore, technological and economic issues, as well as necessary data processing technologies, are discussed.

6,288,,A Machine Learning-Based Method for Predicting Urban Land Use,Artificial neural network; Land use; Machine learning; Urban planning and design,"Land use is one of the most basic elements of urban management. In urban planning and design, land use is often determined by experience and case studies. However, the development of urbanization has led to a combinatory trend for land use, and the land use of a plot is always impacted by the surrounding environment. In such a complex situation, it is difficult to find hidden relationships among types of land use by humans alone. Within artificial intelligence, machine learning can help find correlations among data. This paper presents a new method for learning the rules relating the known land use data and predicting the land use of a target plot by constructing an artificial neural network. We take Nanjing as a specific case and study the logic of its land use. The results not only demonstrate associations between the surroundings and the target but also show the feasibility of a combinatory land use index in urban planning and design. © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",2020,"RE: Anthropocene, Design in the Age of Humans - Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, CAADRIA 2020","Xia X., Tong Z.",,Conference Paper,4.7698397636,5.9538235664
6,299,13.0,Spatiotemporal modeling of urban growth using machine learning,Computer vision; Machine learning; Spatiotemporal modeling; Urban growth; Urban planning tools; Urban science,"This paper presents a general framework for modeling the growth of three important variables for cities: population distribution, binary urban footprint, and urban footprint in color. The framework models the population distribution as a spatiotemporal regression problem using machine learning, and it obtains the binary urban footprint from the population distribution through a binary classifier plus a temporal correction for existing urban regions. The framework estimates the urban footprint in color from its previous value, as well as from past and current values of the binary urban footprint using a semantic inpainting algorithm. By combining this framework with free data from the Landsat archive and the Global Human Settlement Layer framework, interested users can get approximate growth predictions of any city in the world. These predictions can be improved with the inclusion in the framework of additional spatially distributed input variables over time subject to availability. Unlike widely used growth models based on cellular automata, there are two main advantages of using the proposed machine learning-based framework. Firstly, it does not require to define rules a priori because the model learns the dynamics of growth directly from the historical data. Secondly, it is very easy to train new machine learning models using different explanatory input variables to assess their impact. As a proof of concept, we tested the framework in Valledupar and Rionegro, two Latin American cities located in Colombia with different geomorphological characteristics, and found that the model predictions were in close agreement with the ground-truth based on performance metrics, such as the root-mean-square error, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient for continuous variables, and a few others for discrete variables such as the intersection over union, accuracy, and the f1 metric. In summary, our framework for modeling urban growth is flexible, allows sensitivity analyses, and can help policymakers worldwide to assess different what-if scenarios during the planning cycle of sustainable and resilient cities. © 2019 by the authors.",2020,Remote Sensing,"Gómez J.A., Patiño J.E., Duque J.C., Passos S.",10.3390/rs12010109,Article,4.7836852074,5.9730591774

The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts.

This research proposes an approach through machine learning, specifically the ensemble learning approach and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) method as a method of detecting intrusions in the IoT system which is expected to produce better performance. The results of this study indicate that the proposed approach is able to detect intrusion and classify into five types of intrusion including normal intrusion, probe, dos, r2l, u2r.

Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range.

The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%.

Especially in urban environments with pedestrians there exist many different situations. The prediction of future movements with absolute certainty is impossible if the intention of the pedestrian is unknown. This paper is intended to offer a new concept of decision-making for motion planning with vulnerable road-users in urban environments. Reachability analysis is used to define spatial areas based on physical constraints, where the pedestrian might go. The approach is physically inspired and it can be proven for all kind of pedestrians. A new approach to cluster spatial areas is introduced to store specific environmental information about the pedestrian. The maximum values for jerk, acceleration and velocity of the pedestrian are necessary to find reachable areas. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics, ICM 2019","Hartmann M., Watzenig D.",10.1109/ICMECH.2019.8722888,Conference Paper,4.8992247581,5.9233460426

A preeminent problem affecting urban planning is the appropriate choice of location to host a particular activity (either commercial or common welfare service) or the correct use of an existing building or empty space. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these challenges availed with machine learning techniques. The proposed system combines, fuses, and merges various types of data from different sources, encodes them using a novel semantic model that can capture and utilize both low-level geometric information and higher level semantic information and subsequently feeds them to the random forests classifier, as well as other supervised machine learning models for comparisons. Our experimental evaluation on multiple real-world data sets comparing the performance of several classifiers (including Feedforward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bag of Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Naïve Bayes), indicated the superiority of Random Forests in terms of the examined performance metrics (Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall, F-measure and G-mean).",2019,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","Sideris N., Bardis G., Voulodimos A., Miaoulis G., Ghazanfarpour D.",10.3390/s19102266,Article,4.8369812965,6.0262761116

Identifying the location and living conditions of slums is a critical step toward designing effective urban policies. By combining household survey data and census data with high spatial resolution satellite imagery and other geospatial data using multiple methodologies, including machine learning, we attempt to define slums quantitatively within the city of Accra. Within these defined slum areas, the patterns of monetary poverty are assessed. Poverty rates are estimated at the neighborhood level and indicate that living in slums is strongly correlated with higher monetary poverty. Poverty is more prevalent in communities in areas of lower elevation, which in Accra are generally flood-prone areas. However, the results also suggest that not all people living in slums are living in monetary poverty. These results have important policy implications and are crucial to how economic opportunities are generated in slums so that effective urban policies can be designed. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,"2019 Joint Urban Remote Sensing Event, JURSE 2019","Engstrom R., Pavelesku D., Tanaka T., Wambile A.",10.1109/JURSE.2019.8809052,Conference Paper,4.8310098648,5.8721575737
6,377,8.0,Comparison of ANN Classifier to the Neuro-Fuzzy System for Collusion Detection in the Tender Procedures of Road Construction Sector,,"As the contracts in the road construction sector in Poland are usually of extremely high value and financed from the state budget, the tender procedures should not allow for the non-concurrent behaviours of tender participants. Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed. The created tool can be applied for the future tender procedures as a pre-test of a collusion appearance. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2019,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,"Anysz H., Foremny A., Kulejewski J.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/11/112064,Conference Paper,4.810587883,5.9213347435
6,382,19.0,Inferring Pedestrian Motions at Urban Crosswalks,Autonomous vehicles; decision making; machine learning; prediction methods,"Robust prediction of pedestrian behavior is one of the most challenging problems for autonomous driving. Particularly, predicting pedestrian crossings at crosswalks is of considerable importance for avoiding accidents on the one hand and not unnecessarily slowing down traffic on the other hand. Traditional model-based motion tracking and prediction approaches have difficulties in capturing abrupt changes in motions, as humans can perform them. In this paper, an approach for predicting pedestrian motions that combines established motion tracking algorithms with data-driven methods is presented. The approach is built upon a hierarchical structure, where first, the intent of each pedestrian is classified. Then, the approach computes several qualitative metrics, such as time-to-cross, for the pedestrians classified as crossing. The approach is evaluated on a challenging urban data set collected for different types of crosswalks such as roundabouts and straight roads. The evaluation also provides a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed approach. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",2019,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,"Volz B., Mielenz H., Gilitschenski I., Siegwart R., Nieto J.",10.1109/TITS.2018.2827956,Article,4.8920125961,5.9436283112
6,388,12.0,"Multi-GCN: Graph convolutional networks for multi-view networks, with applications to global poverty",,"With the rapid expansion of mobile phone networks in developing countries, large-scale graph machine learning has gained sudden relevance in the study of global poverty. Recent applications range from humanitarian response and poverty estimation to urban planning and epidemic containment. Yet the vast majority of computational tools and algorithms used in these applications do not account for the multi-view nature of social networks: people are related in myriad ways, but most graph learning models treat relations as binary. In this paper, we develop a graph-based convolutional network for learning on multi-view networks. We show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms on three different prediction tasks using mobile phone datasets from three different developing countries. We also show that, while designed specifically for use in poverty research, the algorithm also outperforms existing benchmarks on a broader set of learning tasks on multi-view networks, including node labelling in citation networks. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

6,399,,Intelligence augmentation for urban warfare operation planning using deep reinforcement learning,Deep reinforcement learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Intelligence augmentation; Planning support; Urban warfare,"The density, diversity, connectedness and scale of urban environments make military operations challenging. This paper shows that different artificial intelligence techniques can be combined to provide the commander with various form of intelligence augmentation and to support the decision making process. A warfare model has been developed where an AI system, representing a red unit, learns how to select the position for a target and for several improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in order to prevent the blue unit to locate the target. The blue unit is trained to reach the target by using deep reinforcement learning, while an evolutionary algorithm is used to train the red unit. These techniques do not rely on large amounts of historical data. Different approaches have been used and discussed to optimise the co-learning of the two agents, showing that optimal behaviour can be learned in an urban environment. Information about the most likely positions of the target and the IEDs can be extracted from the policy learned by the system, and used by the commander to provide intelligence augmentation while planning an operation and evaluating different possible courses of action. The reliability of this information depends on the realism of the AI system simulating the red unit, that is strictly dependent on the model used for the blue unit during the training. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

6,409,11.0,"Generative design and performance modeling for relationships between urban built forms, sky opening, solar radiation and energy",Energy performance; Generative design; Parametric modeling; Reinforcement learning; Urban design,"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,Sustainability (Switzerland),"Ye Y., Xie H., Fang J., Jiang H., Wang D.",10.3390/su11061741,Article,4.721095562,5.8186144829

Research on placeness in the past has been conducted via conventional methods like surveys to reveal essential insights for urban planners and architects. For taking a glimpse into placeness by analyzing common factors across geographies, we choose Instagram posts from Starbucks as a case study, owing to its the-next-door coffee shop psychological construct. We conduct our research by first adopting a flexible ontological framework to organize the concepts governing placeness. Next, we curate a dataset of community generated Instagram posts from Starbucks in three major metropolitan cities of the world: New York, Seoul, and Tokyo. The curated dataset is then automatically enriched with contextual attributes such as activity, visitor demographics, and time via machine learning techniques. We finally analyze and validate the quantitative variations in contextual information with findings from well-accepted cross-cultural case studies.

6,470,,Investigating Customer Satisfaction Patterns in a Community Livability Context: An Efficiency-Oriented Decision-Making Approach,,"A comprehensive understanding of neighborhood facilities distribution and functions along with residential quality of life satisfaction is a key asset for relating livability management to transportation networks. Due to the simultaneous involvement of varied factors with an individual's perception of livability, this concept is difficult to measure. Therefore, a more objective means of quantifying livability is needed. The service industry has demonstrated the intersection of machine learning classifiers and survey domain knowledge for evaluating users' quality of experiences; however, this process of inquiry-based learning has never been considered for solving the communication difficulties between community stakeholders and transportation agencies. Another area of overlap is that of urban computing, which integrates computing technology in the traditional context of urban areas, connecting ubiquitous sensing technologies, computational power, and data about the urban environment to promote quality of life for people living in a particular community. To this aim, the focus of this study is on interpreting a linkage between society stated preferences and quantitative measures of livability by extracting information from survey-based methods and translating it to a quantitative framework using combined service industry and urban computing methodologies.

To analyse them, machine learning models have been gotten fame to evaluate complex urban features with correlation matrix and cross validation. There are two major types of data such as top-down and bottom-up data. Interestingly, there is a third category of data that has not been widely deployed yet which we define as the 'Holistic visual data'. It is the general impression to your visual perception of urban environment when you at a specific spot that we believe can be captured by Google Street Views. This paper aims to ask how do top-down, bottomup, and holistic visual data work individually or together to predict the built environment value in urban areas. Admittedly, housing price is a highly spatial metric that involves multifarious interests including macroeconomic policies, the development of the area, the local people, and specific houses' features. To investigate the quality of built environment, machine learning techniques are adopted for different groups of datasets. By comparing several regression and classification models for each groups of data such as top-down, bottom-up and holistic visual data with housing price, the Random Forest model could be proposed as a best model. The intricate urban matrix needs to be organized such an order, but there are multiple factors affecting urban issues including land values and housing prices. By utilizing relevant machine learning models, it can be provided the practical guideline to architects and designers for improving the quality of built environment. © 2018 WIT Press.",2018,International Journal of Sustainable Development and Planning,"Han J.M., Lee N.",10.2495/SDP-V13-N4-516-527,Review,4.7876091003,5.9451365471

6,480,,Localization Decisions of Entrepreneurs: The Role of Path Dependency and Market Forces,,"The purpose of this research is to determine the role of path dependency and market forces in the localization decisions of entrepreneurs from different industries. We hypothesize that most industries develop new entities based on the number of companies from the same industry that already exist in a region. We also hypothesize that entrepreneurs create new entities based on related industries operating within the same knowledge pool. To test these hypotheses, we used the machine learning decision tree method. The input variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland in 2009. The target values are the number of new companies from these industries created in the years 2009-2015. The principal results show that localization decisions are mostly based on demand and supply industries, in which manufacturing industries play crucial role. Path dependency appears in less than half of the industries' models and thus is not the main factor influencing decisions regarding the creation of new companies. The highest share of path-dependent industries is in manufacturing sector, but the degree of the dependence is lower than in the service sector. The service sector seems to be the least path-dependent, as services usually serve other industries. Competition in industries is a rare factor in new company creation; however, if it appears, it usually shrinks the industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2017,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,"Pylak K., Majerek D.",10.1088/1757-899X/245/6/062025,Conference Paper,4.7810091972,5.9140381813000005

In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify.

Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people׳s reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard.

It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related. Building-related indicators include building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and traffic-related indicators include traffic volume, speed and percentage of heavy vehicle.

A lot of rich information comes in textual forms, which traditionally have to be read manually. With advancements in machine learning capabilities, there is potential to tap on it to aid planners in synthesizing insights from large amount of textual feedback data more efficiently. In this paper, we developed a more general urban-centric feedback analysis framework, which encompasses the spatio-temporal thematic of ground sensing. Three essential methods: geotagging, topic modeling, and trend analysis are proposed and a prototype has been implemented. The results of experiments indicate that the proposed framework could not only accurately extract precise geospatial information, but also efficiently analyze the semantic themes based on a probabilistic topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Importantly, the spatial and temporal trends of detected topics indicate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and then benefit domain experts in their routine work and reveal many interesting insights on ground sensing matters. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Chen G., Yu L., Ng W.S., Wu H., Kunasegaran U.N.",10.1007/978-3-319-69179-4_56,Conference Paper,4.8457775116,6.0173721313

In this article, I test the hypothesis whether configurational (syntactic) properties of an urban street network are relevant for the location of land use. If syntactic features are relevant, then land use types may have a 'syntactic signature'. To identify this blueprint, I apply machine-learning techniques to datasets of syntactic measures, for ten business types. The results are ten models, each with the syntactic blueprint of a type of business. The models are used to predict the existence, or not, of such businesses in segments of the map of London. The performance of the models varies, with fifty per cent reaching statistical significance, including one with 'good' prediction ability. The models for Starbucks coffee shops and solicitor's offices have the strongest prediction ability. The exploratory exercise demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning method Random Forests, when supervised and individually applied to a business activity, to identify the syntactic signature of business types. Such models can be used during planning and design and on location studies. The results strengthen the candidacy of syntactic measurements to location-decision-making.

Therefore it is need to fulfill demands for suitable thermal comfort during urban planning and design. Thermal comfort can be modeled based on climatic parameters and other factors. The factors are variables and they are changed throughout the year and days. Therefore there is need to establish an algorithm for thermal comfort prediction according to the input variables. The prediction results could be used for planning of time of usage of urban areas. Since it is very nonlinear task, in this investigation was applied soft computing methodology in order to predict the thermal comfort. The main goal was to apply extreme leaning machine (ELM) for forecasting of physiological equivalent temperature (PET) values. Temperature, pressure, wind speed and irradiance were used as inputs. The prediction results are compared with some benchmark models. Based on the results ELM can be used effectively in forecasting of PET. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,Journal of Thermal Biology,"Jović S., Arsić N., Vilimonović J., Petković D.",10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.07.005,Article,4.6623921394,5.9693932533

6,561,2.0,A reasoning approach for modelling and predicting terroristic attacks in urban environments,predictive reasoning; stream processing; urban terrorist indicators,"During the last decade the world has witnessed a number of terroristic attacks and security incidents exposing numerous vulnerabilities of the urban environment. Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http://www.fp7-proactive.eu/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events. Hence the overall designed builds on top of approaches as event driven architecture, complex event processing systems, and machine learning techniques. A prototype implementation of layer is presented in a simulated validation scenario. The prototype allows an expert user to monitor threat probabilities for different physical environments, and influence the sensitivity of these environments in real-time as well as and provide feedback for adapting the machine learning models. © 2014 IEEE.",2014,Proceedings - International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology,"Archetti F., Djordjevic D., Giordani I., Sormani R., Tisato F.",10.1109/CCST.2014.6987009,Conference Paper,4.8123421669,6.0619301796
6,562,12.0,Predictive analytics can facilitate proactive property vacancy policies for cities,Predictive analytics; Property vacancy; Systems of systems; Urban planning,"Is it possible for a city to understand, analyze, predict, and therefore prevent vacant properties? In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using techniques from machine learning and data mining to determine the future vacancy risks for individual properties and for neighborhoods using a variety of structural, demographic, socioeconomic, and city activity features with high accuracy. Within a larger systems-of-systems framework that we develop, these predictive analytics will allow a city to move from decision-making based on 'educated anecdotes' and reactive strategies aimed at the most urgent need, to policy development based on informed, holistic insight and proactive interventions that prevent and reverse decline. A demonstration of the use of predictive analytics within the sociotechnical system is provided using data from Syracuse, New York. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"Appel S.U., Botti D., Jamison J., Plant L., Shyr J.Y., Varshney L.R.",10.1016/j.techfore.2013.08.028,Article,4.7669668198,5.9845538139
6,564,26.0,A tool for urban soundscape evaluation applying Support Vector Machines for developing a soundscape classification model,Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines,"To ensure appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014,Science of the Total Environment,"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108,Article,4.8560876846,5.9498314857
6,566,10.0,Using data mining techniques to detect the personality of players in an educational game,Classification; Conversation; Educational data; Larry's Rose framework; Natural language processing; Personality,"One of the goals of Educational Data Mining is to develop the methods for student modeling based on educational data, such as; chat conversation, class discussion, etc. On the other hand, individual behavior and personality play a major role in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and Educational Data Mining (EDM). Thus, to develop a user adaptable system, the student's behaviors that occurring during interaction has huge impact EDM and ITS. In this chapter, we introduce a novel data mining techniques and natural language processing approaches for automated detection student's personality and behaviors in an educational game (Land Science) where students act as interns in an urban planning firm and discuss in groups their ideas. In order to apply this framework, input excerpts must be classified into one of six possible personality classes.

6,579,6.0,Visual gaze analysis of robotic pedestrians moving in urban space,gaze analysis; localization; manifold learning; pedestrians; robots; saliency; tracking,"This study is founded on the idea that an analysis of the visual gaze dynamics of pedestrians can increase our understanding of how important architectural features in urban environments are perceived by pedestrians. The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences. We briefly describe how the obtained multidimensional trajectory data can be analysed by using a temporal behaviour analysis technique based on support vector machines that was developed separately. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2012,Architectural Science Review,"Wong A.S.W., Chalup S.K., Bhatia S., Jalalian A., Kulk J., Nicklin S., Ostwald M.J.",10.1080/00038628.2012.688013,Review,4.8898034096,5.916267395

Our model learns vector space representations for various features extraction. In order to apply this framework, input excerpts must be classified into one of six possible personality classes. We applied this personality classification task using several machine learning algorithms, such as: Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Tree. Training is performed on a relatively dataset of manually annotated excerpts. By combining these features spaces from psychology and computational linguistics, we perform and evaluate our approaches to detecting personality, and eventually develop a classifier that is nearly 83% accurate on our dataset. Based on the feature analysis of our models, we add several theoretical contributions, including revealing a relationship between different personality behaviors in players' writing. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2012,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"Keshtkar F., Burkett C., Graesser A., Li H.",10.1007/978-3-642-28601-8_42,Conference Paper,4.7818684578,6.0121712685
