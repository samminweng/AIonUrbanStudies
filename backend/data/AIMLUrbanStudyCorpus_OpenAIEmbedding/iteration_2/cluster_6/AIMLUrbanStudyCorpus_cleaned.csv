6,2,,"Subjective or objective measures of street environment, which are more effective in explaining housing prices?",Human Perception; Property value; Street design qualities; Street view imagery; Subjective measures,"Houses with better street design are found to relate to a price premium. Prior studies mainly present the street quality using objective indicators like tree counts and distance to parks with land use data, or most recently using the greenery view index extracted from street view imagery (SVI). We argue objective indicators cannot completely describe people's sense of a place, as perception is a highly subjective process. We hypothesize that subjective measures using visual surveys could capture more subtle human perceptions, thus providing stronger predictive power to housing prices. However, the role of subjectively measured street design qualities is less known due to the lack of large-scale perception data. To test our hypothesis, we first collected designers’ perceptions on five urban design qualities from pairwise SVIs rankings in Shanghai with an online visual survey. Unlike the mainstream of using generic image features, we followed urban design theory and used rule-based features, i.e., about thirty streetscape elements extracted from SVIs to train machine learning (ML) models to predict subjective perceptions. The predictive power of five qualities versus ten selected individual streetscapes on housing price were compared using the hedonic price model. Besides the standard ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were also developed to account for the spatial dependence and heterogeneity effects. We found both subjectively measured design qualities and objective indicators outperformed housing structural attributes in explaining housing price. While the objective view indexes collectively explained more price variances, the five perceptions individually exhibited stronger strength. Third, less-studied perceptions like “human scale” showed stronger strength than commonly studied “safety” and “enclosure”. Fourth, less-studied view indexes like “person” and “fence” outperformed ubiquitous features like trees and buildings. Lastly, prior studies might have resulted in biased estimations due to ignoring the multicollinear issues between the sky, tree and building views. Our study addressed the effectiveness of incorporating subjective perceptions at a micro level to infer housing prices. correlations between subjective perceptions were strong while that of objective indicators were negligible, therefore subjective perceptions can complement the objective indicators. The findings provide important reference to decision makers when selecting street quality indicators to infer urban design, city planning and community and housing development plans. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Qiu W., Zhang Z., Liu X., Li W., Li X., Xu X., Huang X.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104358,Article,9.5318193436,6.6480197906
6,4,,Detecting individuals' spatial familiarity with urban environments using eye movement data,Eye tracking; Machine learning; Pedestrian navigation; Random forest; Spatial familiarity; Wayfinding,"The spatial familiarity of environments is an important high-level user context for location-based services (LBS). Knowing users' familiarity level of environments is helpful for enabling context-aware LBS that can automatically adapt information services according to users' familiarity with the environment. Unlike state-of-the-art studies that used questionnaires, sketch maps, mobile phone positioning (GPS) data, and social media data to measure spatial familiarity, this study explored the potential of a new type of sensory data - eye movement data - to infer users' spatial familiarity of environments using a machine learning approach. We collected 38 participants' eye movement data when they were performing map-based navigation tasks in familiar and unfamiliar urban environments. We trained and cross-validated a random forest classifier to infer whether the users were familiar or unfamiliar with the environments (i.e., binary classification). By combining basic statistical features and fixation semantic features, we achieved a best accuracy of 81% in a 10-fold classification and 70% in the leave-one-task-out (LOTO) classification. We found that the pupil diameter, fixation dispersion, saccade duration, fixation count and duration on the map were the most important features for detecting users' spatial familiarity. Our results indicate that detecting users' spatial familiarity from eye tracking data is feasible in map-based navigation and only a few seconds (e.g., 5 s) of eye movement data is sufficient for such detection. These results could be used to develop context-aware LBS that adapt their services to users' familiarity with the environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Liao H., Zhao W., Zhang C., Dong W., Huang H.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101758,Article,9.3479709625,6.6569428444
6,18,,Towards a Multi-agents Model for Automatic Big Data Processing to Support Urban Planning,Automation; Big data; Big data analytics; Decision-making; Machine learning; Multi-agent system; Smart data; Urban planning,"The objective of this paper was to propose a multi-agents model for automating big data processing, to improve the process of decision-making and urban planning. The huge amounts of collected data from different domains, such as urban management and remote sensing, are characterized as big data with a spatial component. Smart data is the approach to deal with big data characteristics and challenges by focusing on the Value aspect. The focus on smart data on the relevant data and the mechanism of automation and collaboration of the agents, will contribute to the efficient automating for big data analytics and processing. The proposed approach is based on a collection of agents, and adopt the concept of smart data, this paradigm focus on the aspect value from the big data and help to retrieve the useful information from the large volumes of data by intelligent processing. The proposed model describes the functionalities of the agents. The agents receive data in real time, perform the operations of storing data, pre-processing, streaming processing and batch processing and finally transfer the results of analysis to the services and applications. Machine learning techniques can be used to enhance the aspect of cognition of the agents; through a case study, we used supervised learning methods to build a classification model to support the process of urban planning by predicting the type of habitat adequate for the population based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,"Advances in Science, Technology and Innovation","Sassite F., Addou M., Barramou F.",10.1007/978-3-030-80458-9_1,Book Chapter,9.598408699,6.7321929932
6,31,,Quantifying physical and psychological perceptions of urban scenes using deep learning,Cityscapes; Complex perceptions; Deep learning; Human-oriented; Image big data; Massive street-view datasets,"The complicated relationship between urban scenes and public perceptions has long been a concern in many disciplines. Previous studies have lacked human-oriented technical paths and high-throughput datasets to quantify physical and psychological perceptions in different land-use scenarios. This paper adopts a novel transfer learning approach to quantify the six types of landsense indices (LSIs) as psychological perception metrics and employs panoptic segmentation to parameterize the view index (VI) and the number of foreground instances (NFIs) as physical perception measures. Then, a quantitative analysis is conducted in Beijing's six Ring Road areas, and the connections between people's physical and psychological perceptions of heterogeneous land use are explored. The landsense maps can depict the distribution of LSIs and facilitate the understanding of complex perceptions distributed at a large scale. The regression model shows that natural landscapes (trees, grasses, and mountains) in the Beijing built-up area exhibit an overall positive performance. Moreover, for several block-level land uses, industrial scenery is related to overall negative psychological feelings. Parks and green spaces are positively related to psychological perceptions, because of the greater exposure opportunities to natural landscapes for residents. The framework in this research has potential in assisting urban planning and land-use management, and it enriches the datasets with extensive information, thereby improving the psychological perceptions of urban scenes from residents’ perspectives. The novel approaches in this paper take a step forward in quantifying and understanding the public perceptions of urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,Land Use Policy,"Zhang Y., Li S., Dong R., Deng H., Fu X., Wang C., Yu T., Jia T., Zhao J.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105762,Article,9.5173959732,6.6445765495
6,33,1.0,The influence of urban visuospatial configuration on older adults’ stress: A wearable physiological-perceived stress sensing and data mining based-approach,Isovist analysis; Machine learning; Older adult; Person-environment interaction; Physiological stress; Self-organising map,"Population ageing raises many fundamental questions, including how the urban environment can be configured to promote active ageing. The perceived element for older adults' involvement in the environment differs from the average person. Despite this difference, there is little to no research into understanding how the perceived elements (specifically, the visuospatial configuration) of the environment influence older adults' involvement—most studies focused on younger adults. The focus here is stress, which occurs when environmental demand exceeds a person's capability. As stress impacts a person's involvement in the environment and older adults are more likely to feel stress due to their decline in functional capability, it is important to understand how the visuospatial configuration of urban environment influence stress. Older adults were recruited to participate in an urban environment walk while their physiological responses (Photoplethysmogram) were monitored using wearable sensors. Their perceived stress responses were also collected. Spatial clustering and hot spot analysis were conducted to detect locations with clusters of physiological responses caused by spatial factors. These locations were subsequently labelled as stress or non-stress based on participants' perceived stress. The perceived visual elements of the urban environment were extracted using isovist analysis. Principal component analysis, self-organising map and machine learning algorithms were used to understand the relationship. The results demonstrate that isovist minimum visibility, occlusivity, and isovist area are the most influential determinants of older adults' physiological stress. Older adults prefer urban configurations where they can be seen. This study can be used to inform urban design and planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,Building and Environment,"Torku A., Chan A.P.C., Yung E.H.K., Seo J.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108298,Article,9.3984355927,6.6874427794999995
6,48,1.0,Assessing bikeability with street view imagery and computer vision,Bicycles; Deep learning; GIS; Google Street View; OpenStreetMap; Urban planning,"Studies evaluating bikeability usually compute spatial indicators shaping cycling conditions and conflate them in a quantitative index. Much research involves site visits or conventional geospatial approaches, and few studies have leveraged street view imagery (SVI) for conducting virtual audits. These have assessed a limited range of aspects, and not all have been automated using computer vision (CV). Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability and potentially can be used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining both SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a contribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to assess cycling appeal widely. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,"Ito K., Biljecki F.",10.1016/j.trc.2021.103371,Article,9.4085359573,6.6969046593
6,49,1.0,Modeling pedestrian emotion in high-density cities using visual exposure and machine learning: Tracking real-time physiology and psychology in Hong Kong,Ambulatory pedestrian emotion track; Deep learning; Environment perception; Isovist; Random forest; Street view,"People's mental health has been deteriorating as a result of urban living, which also causes disability, pain, or even death among metropolitan residents. Understanding the interaction between human emotions and the built environment is therefore essential for developing strategies towards a psychologically friendly and socially resilient environment. This study aims to model the pedestrian emotion in high-density urban areas of Hong Kong using machine learning based on environmental visual exposure, which is one of the most significant factors affecting emotions. Using ambulatory sensing and portable technologies, two-dimensional emotional data from 99 pedestrians are retrieved from coupled data with respect to wearable arousal, subjective report preference, and the location at a high spatiotemporal resolution (4 m). The visual environment is quantified by isovist and street view factors. This study examines the impact of visual exposures using two multiple linear regression (MLR) models and establishes a predictive model using random forest (RF) (N = 548). The MLR models have R2 values around 0.5 and suggest that in the high-density environment, exposure to more trees, visual volume, and drift magnitude can cause positive emotions. Conversely, areas with a view of sign symbols, object proportion, min-radial, and occlusivity can cause negative emotions. The resultant predictive model with nine visual exposure variables can explain 79% of the spatial variance of pedestrian emotion. Furthermore, the methodological framework provides opportunities for spatial, data-driven approaches to portable sensing and urban planning research. The findings are also applicable to optimize the infrastructure design of outdoor environments for more psychologically friendly experiences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,Building and Environment,"Xiang L., Cai M., Ren C., Ng E.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108273,Article,9.3901481628,6.6502504349
6,52,,Places for play: Understanding human perception of playability in cities using street view images and deep learning,Built environment; Deep learning; Human perception of place; Playability; Street view images,"Play benefits childhood development and well-being, and is a key factor in sustainable city design. Though previous studies have examined the effects of various urban features on how much children play and where they play, such studies rely on quantitative measurements of play such as the precise location of play and the duration of play time, while people's subjective feelings regarding the playability of their environment are overlooked. In this study, we capture people's perception of place playability by employing Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to classify street view images. A deep learning model trained on the labelled data is then used to evaluate neighborhood playability for three U.S. cities: Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco. Finally, multivariate and geographically weighted regression models are used to explore how various urban features are associated with playability. We find that higher traffic speeds and crime rates are negatively associated with playability, while higher scores for perception of beauty are positively associated with playability. Interestingly, a place that is perceived as lively may not be playable. Our research provides helpful insights for urban planning focused on sustainable city growth and development, as well as for research focused on creating nourishing environments for child development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Kruse J., Kang Y., Liu Y.-N., Zhang F., Gao S.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101693,Article,9.3793029785,6.6923108101
6,58,,Exploring the latent manifold of city patterns,City patterns; Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Urban planning,"Understanding how cities evolve through time and how humans interact with their surroundings is a complex but essential task that is necessary for designing better urban environments. Recent developments in artificial intelligence can give researchers and city developers powerful tools, and through their usage, new insights can be gained on this issue. Discovering a high-level structure in a set of observations within a low-dimensional manifold is a common strategy used when applying machine learning techniques to tackle several problems while finding a projection from and onto the underlying data distribution. This so-called latent manifold can be used in many applications such as clustering, data visualization, sampling, density estimation, and unsupervised learning. Moreover, data of city patterns has some particularities, such as having superimposed or natural patterns that correspond to those of the depicted locations. In this research, multiple manifolds are explored and derived from city pattern images. A set of quantitative and qualitative tests are proposed to examine the quality of these manifolds. In addition, to demonstrate these tests, a novel specialized dataset of city patterns of multiple locations is created, with the dataset capturing a set of recognizable superimposed patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

6,77,2.0,Subjectively measured streetscape perceptions to inform urban design strategies for Shanghai,Computer vision; Global comparison; Human perception; Street view image; Subjective measure,"Recently, many new studies applying computer vision (CV) to street view imagery (SVI) datasets to objectively extract the view indices of various streetscape features such as trees to proxy urban scene qualities have emerged. However, human perception (e.g., imageability) have a subtle relationship to visual elements that cannot be fully captured using view indices. Conversely, subjective measures using survey and interview data explain human behaviors more. However, the effectiveness of integrating subjective measures with SVI datasets has been less discussed. To address this, we integrated crowdsourcing, CV, and machine learning (ML) to subjectively measure four important perceptions suggested by classical urban design theory. We first collected ratings from experts on sample SVIs regarding these four qualities, which became the training labels. CV segmentation was applied to SVI samples extracting streetscape view indices as the explanatory variables. We then trained ML models and achieved high accuracy in predicting scores. We found a strong correlation between the predicted complexity score and the density of urban amenities and services points of interest (POI), which validates the effectiveness of subjective measures. In addition, to test the generalizability of the proposed framework as well as to inform urban renewal strategies, we compared the measured qualities in Pudong to other five urban cores that are renowned worldwide. Rather than predicting perceptual scores directly from generic image features using a convolution neural network, our approach follows what urban design theory has suggested and confirmed as various streetscape features affecting multi-dimensional human perceptions. Therefore, the results provide more interpretable and actionable implications for policymakers and city planners. © 2021 by the authors.

6,116,5.0,Measuring heterogeneous perception of urban space with massive data and machine learning: An application to safety,Built environment; Heterogeneous perception; Machine learning; Urban space safety,"In the last decade, large street imagery data sets and machine learning developments have allowed increasing scalability of methodologies to understand the effects of landscape attributes on the way they are perceived. However, these new methodologies have not incorporated individual heterogeneity in their analysis, even though differences by gender and other sociodemographic characteristics in the perception of safety and other aspects of landscapes and public spaces have been widely studied in social sciences and urban planning in lower scale studies. In the present study, we combine computational and statistical tools to develop a methodological proposal with high scalability and low implementation cost, which helps to identify and measure heterogeneous perception and its correlation to the presence of elements in the landscape. To achieve this, we implement a survey of perception of public spaces, collecting sociodemographic information of respondents. Then, we fit a discrete choice model to quantify perceptions of these spaces using a parametrization of images that jointly considers semantic segmentation and object detection as input. Our results show heterogeneity in the perception of safety in public spaces according to gender and the observer's habitual mobility choices. The model is then applied to the city of Santiago, Chile. This produces a map of safety perception for different types of users. The proposed method and the obtained results can be a relevant input for the design of public spaces and decision making in the urban planning process. © 2020",2021,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Ramírez T., Hurtubia R., Lobel H., Rossetti T.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.104002,Article,9.386677742,6.7420854568

6,170,1.0,Evolution of historical urban landscape with computer vision and machine learning: A case study of Berlin,Computer vision; Google street view image; Machine learning; Perceptual qualities,"Previous studies of historical urban landscape usually focused on the qualitative analysis of city planning and development with the social, economic, and political context, but overlooked quantitative analysis from human perceptions. In this study, we objectively measured the seemingly subjective qualities of the eye-level urban landscape perceptions with computer vision and machine learning technologies. We then explored correlations between the measured perceptual qualities and characteristics from the historical context. We chose Berlin as a research object because it is a capital city that owns a rich history of division and reunification, as well as a variety of residential zones built at different periods. We extracted 30 street features from the 150,000 Google Street View Imagery (SVI) dataset with a computer vision algorithm and evaluated eight perceptual qualities including typology, order, ecology, enclosure, aesthetics, richness, accessibility and scale with a machine learning method. Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning policies in streetscape improvement. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.",2021,Journal of Digital Landscape Architecture,"Tian H., Han Z., Xu W., Liu X., Qiu W., Li W.",10.14627/537705039,Article,9.4824609756,6.6775860786

However, visitors’ experience of public space and the subsequent perceptions and sense of place are often difficult to measure because of its intangible nature and the expensive data collection process. This study collected 20,476 online reviews from 18,387 Tripadvisor users from 2008 to 2019 to understand how visitors experience and react to the public spaces on the Las Vegas Strip. We effectively elicited sense of place on the Las Vegas Strip and quantified the popularity and sentiment of each sense of place facet with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and logistic regression machine learning methods. The results specified 30 distinct topics related to the Strip, among which the most important ones were exploring different hotels, night scene, people watching, and walking long distances. The visitor experience explored within this study uncovered multiple facets of sense of place on the Strip and suggested urban design strategies and public space management policies related to the programmatic and physical elements of the Strip sidewalks. The study shows how online reviews can provide strong empirical evidence for visitor experience in built environment projects.

6,268,,A machine learning method of predicting behavior vitality using open source data,,"The growing popularity of machine learning has provided new opportunities to predict certain behaviors precisely by utilizing big data. In this research, we use an image-based neural network to explore the relationship between the built environment and the activity of bicyclists in that environment. The generative model can produce heat maps that can be used to predict quantitatively the cycling and running activity in a given area, and then use urban design to enhance urban vitality in that area. In the machine learning model, the input image is a plan view of the built environment, and the output image is a heat map showing certain activities in the corresponding area. After it is trained, the model yields output (the predicted heat map) at an acceptable level of accuracy. The heat map shows the levels and conditions of the subject activity in different sections of the built environment. Thus, the predicted results can help identify where regional vitality can be improved. Using this method, designers can not only predict the behavioral heat distribution but also examine the different interactions between behaviors and aspects of the environment. The extent to which factors might influence behaviors is also studied by generating a heat map of the modified plan. In addition to the potential applications of this approach, its limitations and areas for improvement are also proposed. © Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

This paper further proposes a new method for design based on the resulting model, where a designer can identify areas of a city tied to certain perceptual qualities and generate speculative street scenes optimized for their predicted saliency on labels of human experience.This work extends Kevin Lynch's Image of the City with deep learning: training an image classification model to recognize Lynch's five elements of the city image, using Lynch's original photographs and diagrams of Boston to construct labeled training data alongside new imagery of the same locations.

A designer can search and map the data set to understand spatial opportunities and predict the quality of imagined designs through a dynamic process of collage, model inference, and adaptation.Within a larger practice of design, this work suggests that the curation of archival records, computer science techniques, and theoretical principles of urbanism might be integrated into a single craft.

6,270,,Clustering and morphological analysis of campus context,,"Figure-ground"" is an indispensable and significant part of urban design and urban morphological research, especially for the study of the university, which exists as a unique product of the city development and also develops with the city. In the past few decades, methods adapted by scholars of analyzing the figure-ground relationship of university campuses have gradually turned from qualitative to quantitative. And with the widespread application of AI technology in various disciplines, emerging research tools such as machine learning/deep learning have also been used in the study of urban morphology. On this basis, this paper reports on a potential application of deep clustering and big-data methods for campus morphological analysis. It documents a new framework for compressing the customized diagrammatic images containing a campus and its surrounding city context into integrated feature vectors via a convolutional autoencoder model, and using the compressed feature vectors for clustering and quantitative analysis of campus morphology. © Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

Different ways of landscape design can add natural landscape to the urban ecosystem, and will not destroy the ecological environment, but will gradually improve the quality of the ecological environment. However, the design methods of landscape in urban planning in China are not perfect enough, there are many problems, and it is difficult to improve the ecological environment of the city. Therefore, in the process of urban planning, the relevant personnel should fully understand the design methods of landscape, and constantly innovate to create a quality living environment for people. In this paper, we propose the landscape architecture system based on mobile edge streaming media data processing. In the system, video surveillance system is mainly used to collect data, and the edge computing is the further processing of the inner connections. Especially, the stram data is analysed based on the machine learning models and the connection with the design is analysed. The experimental results prove robustness of the methodology.

The research is based on the analysis of the data collected from social surveys and characteristics of the environment from open sources. The urban environment is seen as a complex system that can be analyzed though the point of view of the urban context. The urban context is formed by the geophisical and social features that forms citizens habitat. At the same time, the perception of the urban environment by citizens depends both on the parameters of the urban environment and on the socio-demographic features of the studied group.

6,280,3.0,An investigation of the visual features of urban street vitality using a convolutional neural network,China; convolutional neural network; Nanjing; Urban street vitality; visual feature,"As a well-known urban landscape concept to describe urban space quality, urban street vitality is a subjective human perception of the urban environment but difficult to evaluate directly from the physical space. The study utilized a modern machine learning computer vision algorithm in the urban build environment to simulate the process, which starts with the visual perception of the urban street landscape and ends with the human reaction to street vitality. By analyzing the optimized trained model, we tried to identify urban street vitality’s visual features and evaluate their importance. A region around the Mochou Lake in Nanjing, China, was set as our study area. Seven investigators surveyed the area, recorded their evaluation score on each site’s vitality level with a corresponding picture taken on site. A total of 370 pictures and recorded score pairs from 231 valid survey sites were used to train a convolutional neural network. After optimization, a deep neural network model with 43 layers, including 11 convolutional ones, was created. Heat maps were then used to identify the features which lead to high vitality score outputs. The spatial distributions of different types of feature entities were also analyzed to help identify the spatial effects. The study found that visual features, including human, construction site, shop front, and roadside/walking pavement, are vital ones that correspond to the vitality of the urban street. The consistency of these critical features with traditional urban vitality features indicates the model had learned useful knowledge from the training process. Applying the trained model in urban planning practices can help to improve the city environment for better attraction of residents’ activities and communications. © 2020 Wuhan University.

6,287,4.0,Machine Learning Assisted Urban Filling,Artificial intelligence; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Urban design,"When drawing urban scale plans, designers should always define the position and the shape of each building. This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks. The analysis of different machine learning models trained by the data from different cities inspires urban designers with design strategies and features in distinct conditions. © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",2020,"RE: Anthropocene, Design in the Age of Humans - Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia, CAADRIA 2020","Shen J., Liu C., Ren Y., Zheng H.",,Conference Paper,9.5008802414,6.7439732552

6,315,,Urban street contexts classification using convolutional neural networks and streets imagery,Applications; Big Data; Computer Vision; Data from the wild; IoT; Urban Computing,"The classification of streets on road networks has been focused on the vehicular transportational features of streets. Examples of street labels include arterials, major roads, minor roads and so forth based on their transportational use. City authorities on the other hand have been shifting to more wholistic planning of streets. The modern approach towards designing and planning streets is more inclusive of the street context, meaning the side use of a street combined with the transportational features of a street. Several city authorities are developing new classification schemes for street context that extends traditional classification methods to include the use of land on the sides of a street. In those classification schemes, streets are labeled for example as commercial throughway, residential neighborhood, park etc. This modern approach to urban planning have been adopted by major cities such as the city of San Francisco, the state of Florida and Pennsylvania among many others. Currently, the process of labeling streets according to their contexts is manual and hence is tedious and time consuming. It will require manual labor to regularly relabel streets as the city develops. In this paper, we propose an approach to deploy advancements in computer vision towards modern urban planning. We propose a framework for automatic classification of street contexts. Using labeled street imagery we train deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform the classification of street context. We show that CNN models can perform well achieving accuracies in the 81% to 87% range. We test various CNN architectures and report on their performances. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,"Proceedings - 18th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2019","Alhasoun F., Gonzalez M.",10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00198,Conference Paper,9.3687047958,6.741042614

Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2019,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Ye Y., Richards D., Lu Y., Song X., Zhuang Y., Zeng W., Zhong T.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.08.028,Article,9.4795770645,6.6849942207

With the help of recently emerged street view images and machine learning algorithms, an evaluation model has been trained to assess the perceived visual quality with accuracy similar to that of experienced urban designers, to provide full coverage and detailed results for a citywide area. The town centre of Shanghai was selected for the site. Around 140,000 screenshots from Baidu Street View were processed and a machine learning algorithm, SegNet, was applied to intelligently extract the pixels representing key elements affecting the visual quality of streets, including the building frontage, greenery, sky view, pedestrian space, motorisation, and diversity. A Java-based program was then produced to automatically collect the preferences of experienced urban designers on representative sample images. Another machine learning algorithm, i.e. an artificial neural network, was used to train an evaluation model to achieve a citywide, high-resolution evaluation of the visual quality of the streets. Further validation through different approaches shows this evaluation model obtains a satisfactory accuracy. The results from the artificial neural network also help to explore the high or low effects of various key elements on visual quality. In short, this study contributes to the development of human-centred planning and design by providing continuous measurements of an ‘unmeasurable’ quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights on the perceptual-based visual quality and detailed mapping of various key elements in streets can assist in more efficient street renewal by providing accurate design guidance. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science,"Ye Y., Zeng W., Shen Q., Zhang X., Lu Y.",10.1177/2399808319828734,Article,9.3858985901,6.6633663176999995

Nowadays there is no well defined process in decision making when planning the creation or development of public spaces. For this reason, a study to measure the human perception was made in order to gather data about what people perceived about five variables: architectural beauty, pollution, fun, wealth and safety. The information obtained was used to create a Machine learning model that could find a relation between the perception obtained and the census dataset.

However, most studies so far have focused on only few features, such as street greenery or accessibility. These features fail to capture people’s holistic perceptions. The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method. The classification was tested with experts. The analytical framework developed through this study contributes to human-oriented urban planning practices to further encourage physical activity and public health. © 2019 by the author.

This is due to its social relevance, and to its effect on some local economic activities. Even though people safety perception is a subjective topic, sometimes it is possible to find out common beliefs given a restricted sociocultural context. This paper presents an approach that makes use of image processing and machine learning techniques to model citizen's safety perception using visual information of city images. The proposed method predicts how safe a given street of Bogotá City can be. This is done based on people judgment of the visual appearance of a street image. Results suggest that the obtained model is able to detect city streets, where a visual feature is linked to an activity or street condition that has a significant influence on their associated safety perception.

At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on façades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of façade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building façades.

This paper shows that different artificial intelligence techniques can be combined to provide the commander with various form of intelligence augmentation and to support the decision making process. A warfare model has been developed where an AI system, representing a red unit, learns how to select the position for a target and for several improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in order to prevent the blue unit to locate the target. The blue unit is trained to reach the target by using deep reinforcement learning, while an evolutionary algorithm is used to train the red unit. These techniques do not rely on large amounts of historical data. Different approaches have been used and discussed to optimise the co-learning of the two agents, showing that optimal behaviour can be learned in an urban environment. Information about the most likely positions of the target and the IEDs can be extracted from the policy learned by the system, and used by the commander to provide intelligence augmentation while planning an operation and evaluating different possible courses of action. The reliability of this information depends on the realism of the AI system simulating the red unit, that is strictly dependent on the model used for the blue unit during the training. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well.

Applications include furniture arrangement, space partitioning (e.g. subdividing a house into rooms), urban planning, and other design tasks. Computer-aided support systems are essential tools for architects and designers to produce custom, functional layouts. Existing systems, however, do not learn the designer’s preferences, and therefore fail to generalize across sessions or instances. We propose addressing layout synthesis by casting it as a constructive preference elicitation task. Our solution employs a coactive interaction protocol, whereby the system and the designer interact by mutually improving each other’s proposals. The system iteratively recommends layouts to the user, and learns the user’s preferences by observing her improvements to the recommendations. We apply our system to two design tasks, furniture arrangement and space partitioning, and report promising quantitative and qualitative results on both.

Understanding these perceptions may be useful to inform the design, management and planning process of public spaces. Recently, several studies have used data collected at a massive scale and machine learning methods to quantify these perceptions, showing promising results in terms of predictive performance. Nevertheless, most of these models can be of little help in understanding users’ perceptions due to the difficulty associated with identifying the importance of each attribute of landscapes. In this work, we propose a novel approach to quantify perceptions of landscapes through discrete choice models, using semantic segmentations of images of public spaces, generated through machine learning algorithms, as explanatory variables.

Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,Landscape and Urban Planning,"Zhang F., Zhou B., Liu L., Liu Y., Fung H.H., Lin H., Ratti C.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.08.020,Article,9.4626922607,6.6706342697

This urban evaluation approach will be more human-centered, which can be extended to help urban planners and citizens to explore the significant impacts on city decision optimization or spatial economics-related issues like decreasing the cost of properties assessment. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Data Science in Cyberspace, DSC 2018","Zhao J., Liu X., Kuang Y., Chen Y.V., Yang B.",10.1109/DSC.2018.00012,Conference Paper,9.4183082581,6.7173585892

Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of large numbers of photographs is time consuming. This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm – Google Cloud Vision – to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20% of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2018,Ecosystem Services,"Richards D.R., Tunçer B., Tunçer B.",10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.09.004,Article,9.515794754,6.7336306572

In particular, we built machine learning classifiers to predict the class of a location where each class corresponds to a set of locations having equal aesthetic rating. These models are trained on two empirically build datasets containing locations in two different cities (Rome and Paris) where aesthetic ratings of locations were gathered from TripAdvisor.com. In this work we exploit the idea that in a location with higher aesthetic rating, it is more likely for an user to capture a photo and other users are more likely to interact with that photo. Our models achieved as high as 79.48% accuracy (78.60% precision and 79.27% recall) on Rome dataset and 73.78% accuracy(75.62% precision and 78.07% recall) on Paris dataset.

In order for the planners to make informed decisions, data from multiple sources have to be retrieved and cross-referenced efficiently. We discuss the implementation of a query engine which accepts natural language as input, using machine learning and NLP techniques namely word embedding, CNN, rule-based system and NER to produce accurate output enriched with geographical insights to facilitate the planning process.

6,465,2.0,Machine learning for real-time urban metrics and design recommendations,,"Cities are growing, becoming more complex, and changing rapidly. Currently, community engagement for urban decision-making is often ineffective, uninformed, and only occurs in projects’ later stages. To facilitate a more collaborative and evidence-based urban decision-making process for both experts and non-experts, real-time feedback and optimized suggestions are essential. However, most of the current tools for urban planning are neither capable of performing complex simulations in real-time nor of providing guidance for better urban performance. CityMatrix was introduced to address these challenges. Machine learning techniques were applied to achieve real-time prediction of multiple urban simulations, and thousands of city configurations were simulated. The simulation results were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the traffic and solar performance of unseen city configurations. The prediction with the CNN is thousands of times faster than the original simulations and maintains a high-quality representation of the results. This machine learning approach was applied as a versatile, quick, accurate, and computationally efficient method not only for real-time feedback, but also for optimized design recommendations. Users involved in the evaluation of this project had a better understanding of the embodied trade-offs of the city and achieved their goals in an efficient manner. © CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

6,477,39.0,StreetVizor: Visual Exploration of Human-Scale Urban Forms Based on Street Views,human scale; street view; Urban forms; visual analytics,"Urban forms at human-scale, i.e., urban environments that individuals can sense (e.g., sight, smell, and touch) in their daily lives, can provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, such as urban planning and environment auditing. The analysis of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design. However, such analysis is complex because of the involvement of spatial, multi-scale (i.e., city, region, and street), and multivariate (e.g., greenery and sky ratios) natures of urban forms. In addition, current methods either lack quantitative measurements or are limited to a small area. The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales; 2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with case studies on the real-world datasets of four cities, i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Greater London and New York City.

6,489,90.0,A machine learning-based method for the large-scale evaluation of the qualities of the urban environment,Architecture; Machine learning; Physical quality; Street view image; Urban design,"Given the present size of modern cities, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the qualities of the urban space at every street corner. Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as ‘where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration’ and ‘in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing’. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents. © 2017 The Authors",2017,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems","Liu L., Silva E.A., Wu C., Wang H.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2017.06.003,Article,9.3661985397,6.7079086304

Understanding which factors shape this perception informs both urban planners, that aim at improving city life, as well as computational models that help us navigate in urban spaces. To understand cities at scale, crowdsourcing games have been employed successfully to evaluate citizens' opinions about cities and urban scenes. By analyzing human perceptions from residents of a mid-sized Brazilian city, this work brings three novel contributions. First, we consider theories from urban design to explore through crowdsourcing which high and low level features in an urban space are linked to perceptions of safety and pleasantness. Secondly, this paper leverages theory from urban sociology and anthropology to show how the sociodemographic pro.le of the citizens signi.cantly mediate their perception of safeness and pleasantness of places. Finally, we show that features of the urban form proposed by urbanists can be combined with sociodemographics to improve the accuracy of machine learning models that predict which scene a person will .nd more safe or pleasant. .is last result paves the road for more personalized recommendations in cold-start scenarios. © 2017 ACM.",2017,HT 2017 - Proceedings of the 28th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,"Candeia D., Figueiredo F., Andrade N., Quercia D.",10.1145/3078714.3078728,Conference Paper,9.4402561188,6.7435369492

Under present day conditions, the identities of cities are rapidly deteriorating and vanishing. Therefore, the importance of urban design, which is a means of designing urban spaces and their physical and social aspects, is ever growing. This paper proposes a novel methodology by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering approach to find important features of the urban identity from public space. K. Lynch's work and Space Syntax theory are reconstructed and integrated with POI (Points of Interest) to quantify the quality of the public space. A case study of Zürich city is used to test of these redefinitions and features of urban identity. The results show that PCA and K-means clustering approach can identify the urban identity and explore important features. This strategy could help to improve planning and design processes and generation of new urban patterns with more appropriate features and qualities. © 2017 IEEE.",2017,"Proceedings - 16th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2017","Chang M.-C., Bus P., Schmitt G.",10.1109/ICMLA.2017.00015,Conference Paper,9.4886684418,6.7263450623
6,523,97.0,Measuring visual enclosure for street walkability: Using machine learning algorithms and Google Street View imagery,Enclosure; Machine learning; Street design features; Walkability,"One major limitation currently with studying street level urban design qualities for walkability is the often inconsistent and unreliable measures of streetscape features across different field surveyors even with costly training due to lack of more objective processes, which also make large scale study difficult. The recent advances in sensor technologies and digitization have produced a wealth of data to help research activities by facilitating improved measurements and conducting large scale analysis. This paper explores the potential of big data and big data analytics in the light of current approaches to measuring streetscape features. By applying machine learning algorithms on Google Street View imagery, we generated objectively three measures on visual enclosure. The results showed that sky areas were identified fairly well for the calculation of proportion of sky. The three visual enclosure measures were found to be correlated with pedestrian volume and Walk Score. This method allows large scale and consistent objective measures of visual enclosure that can be done reproducibly and universally applicable with readily available Google Street View imagery in many countries around the world to help test their association with walking behaviors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,Applied Geography,"Yin L., Wang Z.",10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.09.024,Article,9.4036483765,6.7051858902

In terms of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), the defined measure corresponds to a subjective expected utility of a user. In the first stage of the proposed approach we let the algorithm explore a design space using clustering techniques.

Currently, urban planners are hindered by a lack of information available in a format suitable for the large-scale analysis of sidewalk design. To demonstrate the impact that information technology could have in this area, we leverage techniques from machine learning and computer vision to gather information about the presence and quality of sidewalks in map images. In particular, we identify sidewalk segments in street view images using a random forest classifier, utilizing a set of local and global features that include geometric context, presence of lanes, pixel color, and location. Our results illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segments in a large set of street view images.

In this multi-disciplinary experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA) bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical activity levels with the associated health benefits. A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area. A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of individual or group of these variables to better understand how the built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes.
