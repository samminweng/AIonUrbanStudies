5,126.0,2013,Article,Partial least-squares regression for linking land-cover patterns to soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds,"There are strong ties between land cover patterns and soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds. The spatial configuration of land cover has recently become an important aspect of the study of geomorphological processes related to erosion within watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of soil erosion and sediment yield to land cover patterns in watersheds. However, many landscape metrics are highly correlated and may result in redundancy, which violates the assumptions of a traditional least-squares approach, thus leading to singular solutions or otherwise biased parameter estimates and confidence intervals. Here, we investigated the landscape patterns within watersheds in the Upper Du River watershed (8973km2) in China and examined how the spatial patterns of land cover are related to the soil erosion and sediment yield of watersheds using hydrological modeling and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The results indicate that the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield are closely associated with the land cover patterns. At the landscape level, landscape characteristics, such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), contagion (CONTAG), and patch cohesion index (COHESION), were identified as the primary metrics controlling the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield. The landscape characteristics in watersheds could account for as much as 65% and 74% of the variation in soil erosion and sediment yield, respectively. Greater interspersion and an increased number of patch land cover types may significantly accelerate soilerosion and increase sediment export. PLSR can be used to simply determine the relationships between land-cover patterns and watershed soil erosion and sediment yield, providing quantitative information to allow decision makers to make better choices regarding landscape planning. With readily available remote sensing data and rapid developments in geographic information system (GIS) technology, this practical and simple PLSR approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Co-dependent data; Landscape metrics; Sediment delivery ratio; Sediment yield; Soil erosion,"Shi Z.H., Ai L., Li X., Huang X.D., Wu G.L., Liao W.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.06.031
8,101.0,2017,Article,A data-driven predictive model of city-scale energy use in buildings,"Many cities across the United States have turned to building energy disclosure (or benchmarking) laws to encourage transparency in energy efficiency markets and to support sustainability and carbon reduction plans. In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1 million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2 kbtu/sf and for residential buildings is 31.2 kbtu/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings – those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall – are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Building energy; Energy efficiency; Energy prediction; Machine learning; Urban dynamics,"Kontokosta C.E., Tull C.",10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.04.005
10,94.0,2017,Article,"Urbanization impact on landscape patterns in Beijing City, China: A spatial heterogeneity perspective","The temporal and spatial characteristics of landscape pattern change can reflect the spatial impact of urbanization on the ecological environment. Studying the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns can provide supports for urban ecological management. Previous studies have examined the quantitative relationship between the social economy and landscape patterns of an entire region, but have not considered the spatial non-stability of this relationship. In this study, we characterized the landscape patterns in Beijing City, China during 2000 and 2010 using four landscape metrics, i.e. patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the aggregation index (AI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity and evolution characteristics of the relationship between the urbanization of population density (POP), gross domestic production (GDP) and nighttime lighting (NTL), and landscape patterns. The evolution of urban landscape patterns indicated a decentralized, aggregated, and fragmented change from the downtown to the suburb and outer suburb. During the 10-year period, the average PD in the downtown increased by 100.6%, and the increase of AI in the suburb was the largest. The PD, ED and SHDI increased by different degrees in the outer suburb. The influences of different urbanization modes on landscape patterns were also different. Infilling mode made the landscape patterns more regular and integrated. The landscape was more broken and complicated under the edge-expanding mode, and the leapfrog mode made PD and SHDI increase slightly. In the relationship interpretation, GWR effectively identified the spatial heterogeneity, and improved the explanatory ability compared to ordinary least squares (OLS). The most intense response to urbanization was the forest landscape and the forest-cultivated land ecotone in the northwest of Beijing City, indicating that this region was ecologically fragile. The population density in the urbanization index had a direct effect on landscape patterns, while the PD affected by urbanization was greater than the shape, aggregation and diversity index. Affected by development policy, urban planning and other factors, the explanation degree of social economy to landscape patterns decreased in 2010. GWR is an effective method for quantifying the spatial differentiation characteristics of urbanization impacts on landscape patterns, which can provide more spatial information and decision criteria for the green development of a compact city. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Compact green city Beijing City, China; GWR; Landscape metrics;Urbanization mode","Huilei L., Jian P., Yanxu L., Yi'na H.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.032
14,86.0,2018,Article,Using image recognition to automate assessment of cultural ecosystem services from social media photographs,"Quantifying and mapping cultural ecosystem services is complex because of their intangibility. Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of large numbers of photographs is time consuming. This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm – Google Cloud Vision – to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20% of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Recreation; Recreational ecosystem services; Singapore; Urban ecology,"Richards D.R., Tunçer B., Tunçer B.",10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.09.004
35,40.0,2021,Article,Urban water resource management for sustainable environment planning using artificial intelligence techniques,"In the current era, water is a significant resource for socio-economic growth and the protection of healthy environments. Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies. Consequently, there is a specific relief from the engagement of supply and demand for water resources, and substantial improvements in local economic efficiency have been simulated with numerical outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Artificial intelligence Markov process; Ecology; Environment management; Environment planning; Water,"Xiang X., Li Q., Khan S., Khalaf O.I.",10.1016/j.eiar.2020.106515
36,39.0,2017,Article,Mapping urban form and function at city block level using spatial metrics,"This paper focuses on the potential of urban metrics describing the presence and the configuration of built-up and open space areas for mapping distinct types of urban form and function at city block level. Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land use and urban form classification based on these metrics. Our study points out the shortcomings of traditional landscape ecological metrics for mapping urban form and emphasizes the need for alternative approaches for analysing urban landscapes, more explicitly describing the morphological characteristics of the urban fabric. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Brussels Capital Region; Land use; Machine learning; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Urban function,"Vanderhaegen S., Canters F.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.023
42,36.0,2017,Article,Scale- and region-dependence in landscape-PM2.5 correlation: Implications for urban planning,"Under rapid urbanization, many cities in China suffer from serious fine particulate matter (PMPM2.5) pollution. As the emission sources or adsorption sinks, land use and the corresponding landscape pattern unavoidably affect the concentration. However, the correlation varies with different regions and scales, leaving a significant gap for urban planning. This study clarifies the correlation with the aid of in situ and satellite-based spatial datasets over six urban agglomerations in China. Two coverage and four landscape indices are adopted to represent land use and landscape pattern. Specifically, the coverage indices include the area ratios of forest (F_PLAND) and built-up areas (C_PLAND). The landscape indices refer to the perimeter-area fractal dimension index (PAFRAC), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). Then, the correlation between PMPM2.5 concentration with the selected indices are evaluated from supporting the potential urban planning. Results show that the correlations are weak with the in situ PMPM2.5 concentration, which are significant with the regional value. It means that land use coverage and landscape pattern affect PMPM2.5 at a relatively large scale. Furthermore, regional PMPM2.5 concentration negatively correlate to F_PLAND and positively to C_PLAND (significance at p &lt; 0.05), indicating that forest helps to improve air quality, while built-up areas worsen the pollution. Finally, the heterogeneous landscape presents positive correlation to the regional PMPM2.5 concentration in most regions, except for the urban agglomeration with highly-developed urban (i.e., the Jing-Jin-Ji and Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomerations). It suggests that centralized urbanization would be helpful for PMPM2.5 pollution controlling by reducing the emission sources in most regions. Based on the results, the potential urban planning is proposed for controlling PMPM2.5 pollution for each urban agglomeration.",China; Land use; Landscape; PMPM2.5 concentration; Spatial variability,"Feng H., Zou B., Tang Y.",10.3390/rs9090918
46,34.0,2017,Article,Forecasting smog-related health hazard based on social media and physical sensor,"Smog disasters are becoming more and more frequent and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas. Social media as a real-time urban data source has become an increasingly effective channel to observe people׳s reactions on smog-related health hazard. It can be used to capture possible smog-related public health disasters in its early stage. We then propose a predictive analytic approach that utilizes both social media and physical sensor data to forecast the next day smog-related health hazard. First, we model smog-related health hazards and smog severity through mining raw microblogging text and network information diffusion data. Second, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model to forecast smog-related health hazard with the current health hazard and smog severity observations. We evaluate the performance of the approach with other alternative machine learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate social media and physical sensor data for smog-related health hazard forecasting. The empirical findings can help researchers to better understand the non-linear relationships between the current smog observations and the next day health hazard. In addition, this forecasting approach can provide decision support for smog-related health hazard management through functions like early warning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Data mining; Forecasting; Health hazard; Smog disaster; Social media; Urban data,"Chen J., Chen H., Wu Z., Hu D., Pan J.Z.",10.1016/j.is.2016.03.011
51,32.0,2016,Article,"Impacts of land use and amenities on public transport use, urban planning and design","Various land-use configurations are known to have wide-ranging effects on the dynamics of and within other city components including the transportation system. In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and ""interpretability"". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of ""regional centers"" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Amenities; Land use; Public transit; Urban planning,"Hu N., Legara E.F., Lee K.K., Hung G.G., Monterola C.",10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.06.004
52,30.0,2019,Article,Upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions,"Non-technical summary Manhattan, Berlin and New Delhi all need to take action to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions.

69,24.0,2014,Article,A tool for urban soundscape evaluation applying Support Vector Machines for developing a soundscape classification model,"To ensure appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines,"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108
73,23.0,2019,Article,Examining threshold effects of built environment elements on travel-related carbon-dioxide emissions,"Understanding how built environment features are associated with travel-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions is essential for planners to encourage environmentally sustainable travel through transportation and land use policies. Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range. These threshold effects offer valuable implications for planners to achieve desirable environmental benefits efficiently. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Machine learning; Travel behavior; Urban form,"Wu X., Tao T., Cao J., Fan Y., Ramaswami A.",10.1016/j.trd.2019.08.018

The framework includes signal frequency unification, signal pairing, signal filtering, signal quantification, and data labeling. Furthermore, this paper contributes to human-environment interaction research, where a field study to understand the influence of environmental features such as varying sound level, illuminance, field-of-view, or environmental conditions on humans’ perception was proposed. In the study, participants of various demographic backgrounds walked through an urban environment in Zürich, Switzerland while wearing physiological and environmental sensors. Apart from signal processing, four machine learning techniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and clustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between the participants’ physiological responses and environmental conditions. The predictive models with high accuracies indicate that the change in the field-of-view corresponds to increased participant arousal. Among all features, the participants’ physiological responses were primarily affected by the change in environmental conditions and field-of-view. © 2018 The Authors",Data fusion; Features selection; Physiological data; Signal processing; Wearable devices,"Ojha V.K., Griego D., Kuliga S., Bielik M., Buš P., Schaeben C., Treyer L., Standfest M., Schneider S., König R., Donath D., Schmitt G.",10.1016/j.ins.2018.09.061
83,21.0,2018,Article,"Using a gradient boosting model to improve the performance of low-cost aerosol monitors in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment","The increased availability and improved quality of new sensing technologies have catalyzed a growing body of research to evaluate and leverage these tools in order to quantify and describe urban environments. Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R2 = 0.36–0.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R2 = 0.68–0.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Air quality; Calibration; Low-cost sensing; Machine learning; Urban,"Johnson N.E., Bonczak B., Kontokosta C.E.",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.04.019
85,20.0,2019,Article,Identification of low-carbon travel block based on GIS hotspot analysis using spatial distribution learning algorithm,"In the future, big data will become an efficient and useful means for improving urban planning, and machine learning can take city as a simplified and efficient system. We take full advantage of the benefits of new technology, but also clarify that city is not a machine, also cannot fully mechanically control the urban development. This study presents a methodology for identifying low-carbon travel block, which can be used to identify the built environment conducive to residents’ low-carbon travel. We chose the four elements of traffic survey—travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency—as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from “WeChat,” a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects—land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types’ building area should be “4:1–3:1”; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350–450 m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15–20%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150 m is 40–50%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50 m is 45–60%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100 m is 50–70%. The results confirm that “functional mixing” and “dense road network” are beneficial to residents’ low-carbon travel proposed by the predecessors. At the same time, we found that not the higher volume rate is, the more favorable for low-carbon travel. Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system. It is not that the higher the bus station coverage is, the better for residents to travel as low-carbon, and the high popularity of public transportation in small cities will increase the carbon emission of residents. The study provides a new way to evaluate the carbon emission assessment of blocks and provides a basis for block planning with low-carbon concept. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Block; Built environment; GIS hotspot analysis; Low-carbon travel,"Hou Q., Zhang X., Li B., Zhang X., Wang W.",10.1007/s00521-018-3447-8
86,20.0,2019,Article,A reduced order model for turbulent flows in the urban environment using machine learning,"To help create a comfortable and healthy indoor and outdoor environment in which to live, there is a need to understand turbulent air flows within the urban environment. To this end, building on a previously reported method [1], we develop a fast-running Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Model (NIROM) for predicting the turbulent air flows found within an urban environment. To resolve larger scale turbulent fluctuations, we employ a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and solve the resulting computational model on unstructured meshes. The objective is to construct a rapid-running NIROM from these results that will have ‘similar’ dynamics to the original LES model. Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and machine learning techniques, this Reduced Order Model (ROM) is six orders of magnitude faster than the high-fidelity LES model and we demonstrate how ‘similar’ it can be to the high-fidelity model by comparing statistical quantities such as the mean flows, Reynolds stresses and probability densities of the velocities. We also include validation of the high-fidelity model against data from wind tunnel experiments. This paper represents a key step towards the use of reduced order modelling for operational purposes with the tantalising possibility of it being used in place of Gaussian plume models, and the potential for greatly improved model fidelity and confidence. © 2018",Gaussian process regression; Machine learning; Non-intrusive reduced order modelling; Operational modelling; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Urban flows,"Xiao D., Heaney C.E., Mottet L., Fang F., Lin W., Navon I.M., Guo Y., Matar O.K., Robins A.G., Pain C.C.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.035
117,13.0,2017,Article,Structure and information in spatial segregation,"Ethnoracial residential segregation is a complex, multiscalar phenomenon with immense moral and economic costs. Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify.

124,12.0,2019,Article,Where to go and what to do: Extracting leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space,"Web data is the most prominent source of information for deciding where to go and what to do. Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level. This opens up new opportunities for data-driven approaches to urban leisure and tourism studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",City planning; Knowledge extraction; Latent semantics; Multi-label classification; Place affordance; Urban space,"van Weerdenburg D., Scheider S., Adams B., Spierings B., van der Zee E.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.09.005
128,11.0,2020,Review,The conceptual basis of water-energy-food nexus governance: systematic literature review using network and discourse analysis,"In the last decade, the debate on the governance of water, energy, and food (WEF) has intensified, spurring the emergence of the term “nexus governance.” In general, the reduction of trade-offs and construction of synergies between WEF have been placed on the scientific, political, and economic agenda. However, although increasingly used, it is difficult to find a clear meaning and definition of what the term represents. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), using text-mining and machine learning algorithms, this article investigates what are the conceptual basis of the nexus governance debate, and attempts to clarify the main themes, networks, and gaps within this literature.

134,11.0,2017,Conference Paper,Transparency in practice: Using visualization to enhance the interpretability of open data,"Urban data is gradually being opened to the public. Tools for exploitation, analysis and discovery of new knowledge in large data sets are the key to enable citizens to make sense of such large amount of data. The purpose of this work is to analyze how data analysis associated with visualization techniques in different levels can lead to the improvement of the interpretability of open data. With the support of machine learning techniques, these visualizations may improve pattern identification in urban data sets. To guide our discussion, a case study was conducted analyzing socioeconomic data released by the Chicago city government. We discussed the use of different visualizations in this scenario, tailored for univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis. We also performed an evaluation of the different forms of visualization proposed in this work. We could observe that allowing the user to explore open urban data using some specific visualizations may lead to more effective data interpretation. © 2017 ACM.",Cluster analysis; Data visualization; Open government data; Sensemaking,"Barcellos R., Viterbo J., Miranda L., Bernardini F., Maciel C., Trevisan D.",10.1145/3085228.3085294
136,11.0,2016,Conference Paper,On urban soundscape mapping: A computer can predict the outcome of soundscape assessments,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a computer may predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, based on acoustic data only. It may be argued that this is impossible, because a computer lack life experience. Moreover, if the computer was able to make an accurate prediction, we also wanted to know what information it needed to make this prediction. We recruited 33 students (18 female; Mage = 25.4 yrs., SDage = 3.6) out of which 30 assessed how pleasant and eventful 102 unique soundscape excerpts (30 s) from Stockholm were. Based on the Bag of Frames approach, a Support Vector Regression learning algorithm was used to identify relationships between various acoustic features of the acoustics signals and perceived affective quality. We found that the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients provided strong predictions for both Pleasantness (R2 = 0.74) and Eventfulness (R2 = 0.83). This model performed better than the average individual in the experiment in terms of internal consistency of individual assessments. Taken together, the results show that a computer can predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, which is promising for future soundscape mapping. © 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA).

140,10.0,2017,Book Chapter,How should urban planners be trained to handle big data?,"Historically urban planners have been educated and trained to work in a data poor environment. Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment. For decades they have learned how to use census data, which is comprehensive on several basic variables, but is only conducted once per decade so is almost always out of date. More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009). Planners are still being trained in methods that are suitable for a data poor environment (J Plan Educ Res 6:10–21, 1986; Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data: the big data revolution!, 101–104, 2011; J Plan Educ Res 15:17–33, 1995). In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape. We will discuss how these methods can be integrated into the planning curriculum as well as planning practice. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Analytics; Big data; Education; Urban planning; Visualization,"French S.P., Barchers C., Zhang W.",10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_12
149,9.0,2019,Conference Paper,"Generative design and performance modeling for relationships between urban built forms, sky opening, solar radiation and energy","For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses. The relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria function derive guidelines for a sustainable and green campus. In future conduct multivariate analysis to examine the relationships between geometric elements and performance measurement metrics. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we investigate a novel way of analyzing data from social sciences studies by employing machine learning and data science techniques. This enables us to maximize the insight gained from this type of studies by fusing both objective (sensor information) and subjective data (direct input from the users). The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas. This paper allows us to gain an overview of certain patterns and the behavior of the citizens within their surroundings and it proves the capabilities of integrating technology into large-scale social studies. © 2019 IEEE.",Data analysis; data science; smart cities; social science; urban analytics; urban planning,"Erhan L., Ndubuaku M., Ferrara E., Richardson M., Sheffield D., Ferguson F.J., Brindley P., Liotta A.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897217

The aim of this study is to analyse what kind of computational methods can be used to analyse social media data to inform urban planning. A descriptive literature review of recent case study articles reveal that in this context SMDA has been applied mainly to location based social media data, such as geo-tagged Tweets, photographs and check-in data. There were only a few studies concerning the use of non-place-based data. Based on this review SMDA can provide planners with local knowledge about people's opinions, experiences, feelings, behaviour, and about the city structure. However, integration of this knowledge in planning and decision-making has not been completely successful in any of the cases. By way of a conclusion, a planning-led categorization of the SMDA method's tools and analysis results is suggested.

169,7.0,2020,Article,"Modelling urban-scale occupant behaviour, mobility, and energy in buildings: A survey","The proliferation of urban sensing, IoT, and big data in cities provides unprecedented opportunities for a deeper understanding of occupant behaviour and energy usage patterns at the urban scale. This enables data-driven building and energy models to capture the urban dynamics, specifically the intrinsic occupant and energy use behavioural profiles that are not usually considered in traditional models. Although there are related reviews, none investigated urban data for use in modelling occupant behaviour and energy use at multiple scales, from buildings to neighbourhood to city. This survey paper aims to fill this gap by providing a critical summary and analysis of the works reported in the literature. We present the different sources of occupant-centric urban data that are useful for data-driven modelling and categorise the range of applications and recent data-driven modelling techniques for urban behaviour and energy modelling, along with the traditional stochastic and simulation-based approaches. Finally, we present a set of recommendations for future directions in data-driven modelling of occupant behaviour and energy in buildings at the urban scale. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Energy in buildings; Energy in cities; Energy modelling; Machine learning; Mobility; Occupant behaviour; Sensors; Urban data,"Salim F.D., Dong B., Ouf M., Wang Q., Pigliautile I., Kang X., Hong T., Wu W., Liu Y., Rumi S.K., Rahaman M.S., An J., Deng H., Shao W., Dziedzic J., Sangogboye F.C., Kjærgaard M.B., Kong M., Fabiani C., Pisello A.L., Yan D.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106964
172,7.0,2020,Article,Analyzing the spatial factors related to the distributions of building heights in urban areas: A comparative case study in Guangzhou and Shenzhen,"Rapid urbanization has become an increasingly serious issue worldwide. While most previous studies focused on two-dimensional urban development, the spatial characteristics of building heights are rarely explored. Such information could provide valuable implications for smart urban planning and management. However, previous attempts did not systematically investigate the spatial factors that influence building heights and their associations with urban development. Therefore, this study developed a machine learning-based method to compare the distributions of building heights in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two cities with different development patterns. First, we collected detailed information on the buildings, such as the location and land values. Second, the height of each building was simulated based on the above information using the well-known random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and artificial neural network. The random forests algorithm outperformed the other two in both cities. We also found that the commercial land value is the most important factor associated with building heights. Moreover, the building heights in Guangzhou are more sensitive to the distances to administrative centers, while the distances to transportation networks exert stronger influences on the building heights in Shenzhen. Overall, these findings could support urban planning and management. More importantly, the proposed method can be used to predict the heights of new buildings and investigate the distributions of building heights in other regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Building heights; Machine learning; Spatial factors; Urban modeling,"Lin J., Wan H., Cui Y.",10.1016/j.scs.2019.101854

Many efforts have been undertaken to identify urban functional zones using various classification approaches and multi-source geospatial datasets. The complexity of this category of classification poses tremendous challenges to these studies especially in terms of classification accuracy, but on the opposite, the rapid development of machine learning technologies provides us with new opportunities. In this study, a set of commonly used urban functional zones classification approaches, including Multinomial Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, are examined and compared with the newly developed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, using the case study of Yuzhong District, Chongqing, China. The investigation is based on multi-variate geospatial data, including night-time imagery, geotagged Weibo data, points of interest (POI) from Gaode, and Baidu Heat Map. This study is the first endeavor of implementing the XGBoost model in the field of urban functional zones classification. The results suggest that the XGBoost classification model performed the best and was able to achieve an accuracy of 88.05%, which is significantly higher than the other commonly used approaches. In addition, the integration of night-time imagery, geotagged Weibo data, POI from Gaode, and Baidu Heat Map has also demonstrated their values for the classification of urban functional zones in this case study. © 2018 by the authors.",Multi-source geospatial data; Urban functional zones classification; XGBoost; Yuzhong district,"Cao K., Guo H., Zhang Y.",10.3390/su11030660

Indoor and outdoor townscapes, because of their dynamic complexity, seem to offer ill-structured holds to the typical spatial behaviour of an agent. Therefore, a question arises about the 'fundamentals' of spacescapes from the point of view of the needs of living and moving agents. Following this thread, the paper deals with the diagnosis and the control of a structured simple space, a minimum arc of a graph. Conditions, situations, elements, behaviours are explored in their spatial-temporal dimensions, subsequently aiming at setting up a system architecture to let spatial agents control their de-structuring impact. Text analysis and interpretation are applied to a questionnaire survey, exploring low level (movement orientation) and high level (memories and fantasies) behaviours in human interaction with a space.

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =∼130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities. Ethics and dissemination This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations. ©",epidemiology; public health; statistics & research methods,"Clark S.N., Alli A.S., Brauer M., Ezzati M., Baumgartner J., Toledano M.B., Hughes A.F., Nimo J., Bedford Moses J., Terkpertey S., Vallarino J., Agyei-Mensah S., Agyemang E., Nathvani R., Muller E., Bennett J., Wang J., Beddows A., Kelly F., Barratt B., Beevers S., Arku R.E.",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035798
208,5.0,2018,Article,Game-based crowdsourcing to support collaborative customization of the definition of sustainability,"Successful adoption and management of sustainable urban systems hinges on the community embracing these systems. Capturing citizens’ ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens’ inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Naïve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Computational linguistic; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Social media; Sustainability; Urban infrastructure,"Nik Bakht M., El-Diraby T.E., Hossaini M.",10.1016/j.aei.2018.08.019
209,5.0,2018,Conference Paper,Comparison of Regression Tools for Regional Electric Load Forecasting,"Urban area electrical load forecasting is important for power generation capacity planning and also to integrate environment friendly energy sources at district level. Load predictions will help in developing demand side management in coordination with renewable power generation. Urban area load is influenced by meteorological conditions therefore it is important to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting. This paper explores the use of regression tool for regional electric load forecasting by correlating lower distinctive categorical level (season and day of the week) and weather parameters. The historical electrical load datasets with meteorological parameters are available for the Sydney region and they have been used to test the regression tools. Data correlation over seasonal changes have been argued by means of improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE). By examining the structure of various regressors they are compared for the lowest MAPE. The regressors show good MAPE for short term (30 min) prediction and Random Forest Regressor scores best in the range of 1-2 % MAPE. © 2018 University of Split, FESB.",Electric Load Forecasting; k-NN; Machine Learning; Regression Tools,"Johannesen N.J., Kolhe M., Goodwin M.",

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale. This study demonstrates how data-driven models can be helpful for water management, especially in environments with strong socioeconomic inequalities, where urban planning decisions should be integrated and inclusive. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Carvalho T.M.N., De Souza Filho F.D.A., Porto V.C.",10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001310

235,4.0,2019,Conference Paper,Comparison of ANN Classifier to the Neuro-Fuzzy System for Collusion Detection in the Tender Procedures of Road Construction Sector,"As the contracts in the road construction sector in Poland are usually of extremely high value and financed from the state budget, the tender procedures should not allow for the non-concurrent behaviours of tender participants. Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed. The created tool can be applied for the future tender procedures as a pre-test of a collusion appearance. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Anysz H., Foremny A., Kulejewski J.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/11/112064

To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3−-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3−-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Scenario planning; Urban form; Urban sprawl; Water quality,"Wang R., Kim J.-H., Li M.-H.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144057
252,3.0,2020,Article,A data-informed analytical approach to human-scale greenway planning: Integrating multi-sourced urban data with machine learning algorithms,"Urban greenways have been recognized as an important strategy to improve human-scale quality in high-density built environments. Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH",Data-informed urban design; Greenway planning; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-sourced urban data,"Tang Z., Ye Y., Jiang Z., Fu C., Huang R., Yao D.",10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126871
253,3.0,2020,Article,"GIS-enabled digital twin system for sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions: A case study of Jeonju city, south Korea","Despite the growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project—in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

254,3.0,2020,Article,Systematizing and upscaling urban climate change mitigation,"The question of what cities can contribute to mitigation and adapting to climate change is gaining traction among researchers and policy makers alike. However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities. © 2020 The Author(s).

259,3.0,2020,Conference Paper,Machine Learning Assisted Urban Filling,"When drawing urban scale plans, designers should always define the position and the shape of each building. This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks. The analysis of different machine learning models trained by the data from different cities inspires urban designers with design strategies and features in distinct conditions. © 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",Artificial intelligence; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Urban design,"Shen J., Liu C., Ren Y., Zheng H.",

Our model learns vector space representations for various features extraction. In order to apply this framework, input excerpts must be classified into one of six possible personality classes. We applied this personality classification task using several machine learning algorithms, such as: Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Tree. Training is performed on a relatively dataset of manually annotated excerpts. By combining these features spaces from psychology and computational linguistics, we perform and evaluate our approaches to detecting personality, and eventually develop a classifier that is nearly 83% accurate on our dataset. Based on the feature analysis of our models, we add several theoretical contributions, including revealing a relationship between different personality behaviors in players' writing. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Classification; Conversation; Leary's Rose Framework; Natural Language Processing; Personality Detection; Sentiment Analysis,"Keshtkar F., Burkett C., Graesser A., Li H.",10.1007/978-3-642-28601-8_42

323,1.0,2021,Article,Big data analytics for identifying electricity theft using machine learning approaches in microgrids for smart communities,"Electricity theft (ET) causes major revenue loss in power utilities. It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning,"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.",10.1002/cpe.6316
326,1.0,2021,Article,An ensemble energy consumption forecasting model based on spatial-temporal clustering analysis in residential buildings,"Due to the availability of smart metering infrastructure, high-resolution electric consumption data is readily available to study the dynamics of residential electric consumption at finely resolved spatial and temporal scales. Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer’s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. © 2021 by the authors.

Urban rainstorms and waterlogging have become an urgent challenge that needs to be monitored in real time and further predicted for the improvement of urbanization construction. We trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging. The RNN model has been thoroughly evaluated, and our experimental results showed that it achieved higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT).

339,1.0,2021,Conference Paper,EquiTensors: Learning Fair Integrations of Heterogeneous Urban Data,"Neural methods are state-of-the-art for urban prediction problems such as transportation resource demand, accident risk, crowd mobility, and public safety. Model performance can be improved by integrating exogenous features from open data repositories (e.g., weather, housing prices, traffic, etc.), but these uncurated sources are often too noisy, incomplete, and biased to use directly. We propose to learn integrated representations, called EquiTensors, from heterogeneous datasets that can be reused across a variety of tasks. We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with ""oracle""models that use hand-selected datasets. © 2021 ACM.",data integration; fairness in machine learning; neural networks; open data; spatial-temporal predictions,"Yan A., Howe B.",10.1145/3448016.3452777
348,1.0,2020,Article,A hybrid air pollutant concentration prediction model combining secondary decomposition and sequence reconstruction,"Acid rain is a serious threat to terrestrial ecosystems. To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction. In future work, the application of the proposed model in other air pollutants or other regions can be explored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Acid rain; Air pollutant prediction; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Extreme learning machine; Sample entropy; Whale optimization algorithm,"Sun W., Huang C.",10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115216
350,1.0,2020,Article,Water Distribution-Transportation Interface Connectivity Responding to Urban Geospatial Morphology,"Water distribution and transportation systems are geospatially colocated, forming a network of connections. This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity.

However, addressing the question of how TOD principles laid out in the international literature can be explored in the context of the global South remains in an incipient stage. In this paper, we investigate the nexus between station walkable catchments and forms of urbanity around transit nodes by adopting an assemblage approach to cut across any separation of sociality and spatiality. Drawing on empirical research from two case studies in Tehran, this paper contributes to studies on transit urban design by developing two measures of accessibility-the Catchment of Accessible Public Spaces (CAPS) and Accessible Interfaces (AI). We found that the combination of high CAPS and high AI within a given time can enable streetlife intensity, which is also linked to a synergistic effect of a larger assemblage, including the number of entries and diversity of functions. We argue that a focus on both measures is critical to understand the performance and potential transformation of street networks in a TOD. © 2020 by the authors.",Accessibility; Global south; Public space; Public/private interface; Transit-oriented development; Urban design; Urban morphology; Urbanism; Urbanity; Walkability,"Peimani N., Kamalipour H.",10.3390/SU12083495

The specific network structure and training pattern were determined through a comprehensive statistical trial-and-error (considering the distribution of errors). The network was applied to the case study in Scotchman's Creek, Melbourne. The network was trained with the first 10% of the exploration data, validated with the following 5% and tested on the rest. The overall root-mean-square-error between the entire observed data and the predicted data is 10.5722, slightly higher than the validation result (9.7961), suggesting that the proposed trial-and-error method is reliable. The designed MLP showed good performance dealing with spatial randomness from decentralized strategies. The adoption of MLP-supported planning may overestimate the performance of candidate urban water systems. By adopting the safety coefficient, a multiplicator or exponent calculated by observed data and predicted data in the validation process, the overestimation problem can be controlled in an acceptable range and have few impacts on final decision making. © 2018 by the authors.",Adaptation planning; Artificial neural network; Multi-layer perception; Urban planning; Water infrastructure,"Zhang J., Fu D., Urich C., Singh R.P.",10.3390/su10124600

The computational experiment was held using the backward propagation of errors method of training the artificial neural network, which was trained based on the geometry of the details of the Roman Corinthian order capital. During the experiment, as an input training data set, five local geometry parameters combined has given the best results: Theta, Pi, Rho in spherical coordinate system based on the capital volume centroid, followed by Z value of the Cartesian coordinate system and a distance from vertical planes created based on the capital symmetry.

It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related. Building-related indicators include building coverage ratio, floor area ratio, and traffic-related indicators include traffic volume, speed and percentage of heavy vehicle.

Researchers have applied machine learning models to generate 2D drawings with pixels or 3D models with voxels, but the pixelization reduces the precision of the geometries. Therefore, in order to learn and generate 3D geometries as vectorized models with higher precision and faster computation speed, we develop a specific artificial neural network, learning and generating design features for the forms of buildings. A customized data structure with feature parameters is constructed, meeting the requirements of the neural network by rebuilding surfaces with controlling points and appending additional input neurons as quantified vectors to describe the properties of the design. The neural network is first trained with generated design data and then tested by adjusting the feature parameters. The prediction of the generated data shows the basic generative ability of the neural network. Furthermore, trained with design data collected from existing buildings, the neural network learns and infers the geometric design features of architectural design with different feature parameters, providing a data-driven method for designers to generate and analyze architectural forms. © 2021 The Authors",Architectural form finding; Artificial neural networks; Computational design; Machine learning,"Zheng H., Yuan P.F.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108178
413,,2021,Article,Dengue disease dynamics are modulated by the combined influences of precipitation and landscape: A machine learning approach,"Background: Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July–December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. © 2021 The Authors",Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning,"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148406
420,,2021,Article,Meta-regression framework for energy consumption prediction in a smart city: A case study of Songdo in South Korea,"Nowadays the concept of smart city has gained in popularity in urban studies. A smart city collects diverse information to monitor and analyze urban systems, such as energy management. It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Energy consumption; Ensemble meta regressor; Machine learning; Smart city; Topical information,"Carrera B., Peyrard S., Kim K.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.103025
425,,2021,Article,Demystifying uncertainty in PM10 susceptibility mapping using variable drop-off in extreme-gradient boosting (XGB) and random forest (RF) algorithms,"This study investigates uncertainty in machine learning that can occur when there is significant variance in the prediction importance level of the independent variables, especially when the ROC fails to reflect the unbalanced effect of prediction variables. A variable drop-off loop function, based on the concept of early termination for reduction of model capacity, regularization, and generalization control, was tested. A susceptibility index for airborne particulate matter of less than 10 μm diameter (PM10) was modeled using monthly maximum values and spectral bands and indices from Landsat 8 imagery, and Open Street Maps were used to prepare a range of independent variables. Probability and classification index maps were prepared using extreme-gradient boosting (XGBOOST) and random forest (RF) algorithms. These were assessed against utility criteria such as a confusion matrix of overall accuracy, quantity of variables, processing delay, degree of overfitting, importance distribution, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).

434,,2021,Conference Paper,Neural Network Based Algorithm for Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning,"This paper proposes a method to tackle the Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem for a fleet of AI-driven UAVs while accounting for congestion, collision avoidance, and efficiency of the path. The algorithm relies on a mixed-use of decentralized Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the A pathfinder. Each UAV has elementary cognitive skills to sense information about the nearby environment which are then fed as an input to the network. The neural network creates a correlation between the current state of a UAV and the best action to take at each time step. The exploration strategy is stored in a labeled database for the single-UAV case; the neural network learns and replicates it in the multi-UAV case, being able to generalize the acquired skills over new maps not contained in the database. The training session imitates human priors in a multi-class classification, which completely bypasses common drawbacks such as the need for large databases or high computational resources. The case study focuses on complex urban areas, for which the grid resolution of the traditional approaches can't model the problem with sufficient accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Neural Network; Supervised Imitation Learning; UAV; Urban Coverage Path Planning,"Sanna G., Godio S., Guglieri G.",10.1109/ICUAS51884.2021.9476864
443,,2021,Article,"Predictive models using “cheap and easy” field measurements: Can they fill a gap in planning, monitoring, and implementing fecal sludge management solutions?","The characteristics of fecal sludge delivered to treatment plants are highly variable. Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. © 2021 The Authors",fecal sludge; image analysis; machine learning; Random forest; sanitation; WASH,"Ward B.J., Andriessen N., Tembo J.M., Kabika J., Grau M., Scheidegger A., Morgenroth E., Strande L.",10.1016/j.watres.2021.116997
447,,2021,Article,A machine learning approach to the simulation of intercity corporate networks in mainland China,"This paper explores the potential of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the simulation of intercity networks. To this end, we implement the random forest MLA to simulate the intercity corporate networks created by Fortune China 500 firms in mainland China. The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940. Nonetheless, the random forest MLA also faces some challenges in the context of the simulation of intercity networks. We conclude that MLAs are potentially useful for specific applications such as the analysis of network big data, scenario simulation in regional planning, and the detection of driving forces in exploratory research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Intercity network; Machine learning; Modelling; Random forest; Simulation; Urban system,"Li L., Derudder B., Kong X.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101598
452,,2021,Review,Review of machine learning techniques for mosquito control in urban environments,"Machine learning (ML) techniques excel at forecasting, clustering, and classification tasks, making them valuable for various aspects of mosquito control. In this literature review, we selected 120 papers relevant to the current state of ML for mosquito control in urban settings. The reviewed work covers several different methodologies, objectives, and evaluation criteria from various environmental contexts. We first divided the existing papers into geospatial, visual, or audio categories. For each category, we analyzed the machine learning pipeline, from dataset creation to model performance. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for further research.

467,,2021,Book Chapter,Planning Support Systems for Long-Term Climate Resilience: A Critical Review,"As climate change is becoming a reality, there is an increasing demand to improve urban resilience. Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience,"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.",10.1007/978-3-030-76059-5_24
524,,2020,Conference Paper,"AI application on LID stormwater management and urban planning in Guam, USA, and Southern China, PRC","Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the usage of AI technologies for hydrological and hydraulic modelling on the application of water resource management. In early model stage, AI methods were used primarily for prediction and forecasting, utilizing quantitative data. With SCADA and sensor applications with internet of things (IOT), AI technologies have increasingly been used for the incorporation of qualitative and subjective information into real time monitoring. With rapid calculation of model results and decision support systems (the AI process), the drainage system can control hydrological devices such as pumps, valves, or gates to adjust or control the flow rate of a drainage system as well as urban drainage ability to model complex hydrological systems in an integrated fashion. There are three parts to the AI applications on blockchain water platform (BWP). From the upstream of BWP, sensors and meters will be able to collect hydrological data such as rain gauge, flowrate, pressure in pipes, and key indicators of water quality. This information will input into hydrological and hydraulic modelling, many engineering modelling software have been used for predicting flow with the scenario analysis. The engineer will be able to run the model 24/7 to collect data from the studying watershed. With continuous updated results, they will be able to obtain real time monitoring. Finally, through the results from the modelling system, operation procedure, drainage analysis, and the decision support system (DSS), control devices such as pumps, valves, and gates will have the ability to be controlled wirelessly. The AI process will allow the urban stormwater drainage to optimize their operation and produce the most efficient results for urban drainage. With this approach, AI will link the sensor data by internet of things (IOT) into the model with model analysis. The overall benefits of using AI storm water management include an increase of energy efficiency, a decrease in flood risks, and a decrease in cost.

544,,2019,Conference Paper,Object Counting on Low Quality Images: A Case Study of Near Real-Time Traffic Monitoring,"The installation and management of traffic monitoring devices can be costly from both a financial and human resource point of view. It is therefore important to take advantage of available infrastructures to maximize the information extraction for each technology. Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services. Furthermore, the resulting annotations pave the way for building a historical vehicle counting dataset to be used for analysing the impact of road traffic on many city-related issues such as urban planning, security, and pollution. © 2018 IEEE.",Monitoring; Object detection; Regression; Smart cities; Time series; Traffic; Transport,"Rajotte J.-F., Sotir M., Noiseux C., Noel L.-P., Bertiere T.",10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00194

565,,2018,Conference Paper,"The technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, artificial intelligence and earth observation","Earth observation is one of the most important applications in downstream space activities. It is widely used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, topographic mapping, agricultural censuses and disaster prevention. However, traditional satellite remote sensing is subject to high cost and long data acquisition cycles, and it is difficult for users to get the data in time. These problems result in insufficient data supply capacity of remote sensing satellites, which leads to difficulties in supporting daily business applications and establishing a fast-growing business model business models. The small satellite segment has seen rapid market growth and technological advancements since 2013 following the multiple successful launches, most notably the Planet, Spire and others. Economies of scale during production are one of the core advantages of the small satellites segment, thus allowing for significant cost reduction throughout their development and production cycles. At the same time, big data analysis and the artificial intelligence (AI) industries are booming. Periodically full coverage data from small satellites provides a data source for data mining and periodic statistics for a wide range of targets. It provides huge opportunities and extension channels for the applications of big data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in Earth observation (EO). The present paper describes research on the technical and commercial increment of the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. In the first section of the paper, a literature review of the common downstream space activities along with identifying the limitations of Earth Observation in terms of high cost and long data acquisition cycles is presented. In the second section, the paper outlines a 4G case study to show that how the improvement of infrastructure brings new application scenarios, verticals and consumers. In the third section, the paper considers the possible new market opportunities of the 5G technology in the fusion of big data analysis, AI and EO. Finally, it concludes by proposing two prototype models in agriculture monitoring and disaster and emergency responses, assesses the technical and commercial increment relative to the current business.

571,,2017,Article,Multi-scale modeling of territorial dynamics of geospatial anthropogenic energy consumption,"Objective: The development of any region or territory stems from its own dynamic nature. Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the development of a new dynamic-based power market design. © 2017 The Authors.",Computational modeling; Geographic information systems; Machine learning-based data analysis,"Rai A., Jagadeesh Kannan R.",10.22159/ajpcr.2017.v10s1.19744
