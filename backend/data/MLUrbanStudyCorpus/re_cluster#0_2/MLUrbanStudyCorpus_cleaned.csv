44,34.0,2018,Article,Citizen-centered big data analysis-driven governance intelligence framework for smart cities,"Sensors and systems within rapidly expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Citizen persona; Citizen profile; Citizen-centered big data; Data merging; Data-analysis algorithm; Governance intelligence; Ontology model; Smart cities,"Ju J., Liu L., Feng Y.",10.1016/j.telpol.2018.01.003
47,34.0,2016,Article,Semantic framework of internet of things for smart cities: Case studies,"In recent years, the advancement of sensor technology has led to the generation of heterogeneous Internet-of-Things (IoT) data by smart cities. Thus, the development and deployment of various aspects of IoT-based applications are necessary to mine the potential value of data to the benefit of people and their lives. However, the variety, volume, heterogeneity, and real-time nature of data obtained from smart cities pose considerable challenges. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework that integrates the IoT with machine learning for smart cities. The proposed framework retrieves and models urban data for certain kinds of IoT applications based on semantic and machine-learning technologies. Moreover, we propose two case studies: pollution detection from vehicles and traffic pattern detection. The experimental results show that our system is scalable and capable of accommodating a large number of urban regions with different types of IoT applications. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Energy management; Internet of things; Smart city; Traffic pattern,"Zhang N., Chen H., Chen X., Chen J.",10.3390/s16091501
57,28.0,2020,Article,PSO-ELM: A Hybrid Learning Model for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting,"Accurate and reliable traffic flow forecasting is of importance for urban planning and mitigation of traffic congestion, and it is also the basis for the deployment of intelligent traffic management systems. However, constructing a reasonable and robust forecasting model is a challenging task due to the uncertainties and nonlinear characteristics of traffic flow. Aiming at the nonlinear relationship affecting traffic flow forecasting effect, a PSO-ELM model based on particle swarm optimization is proposed for short-term traffic flow forecasting, which takes the advantages of particle swarm optimization to search global optimal solution and extreme learning machine to fast deal with the nonlinear relationship. The proposed model improves the accuracy of traffic flow forecasting. The traffic flow data from highways A1, A2, A4, A8 connecting to Amsterdam's ring road are employed for the case study. The RMSEs of PSO-ELM model are respectively 252.61, 173.75, 200.24, 146.05, while the MAPEs of PSO-ELM model are respectively 11.86%, 10.10%, 10.74%, 11.60%. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposal is significantly better than the performance of state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE.",extreme learning machine; particle swarm optimization; Short-term traffic flow forecasting; time-series model,"Cai W., Yang J., Yu Y., Song Y., Zhou T., Qin J.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963784
108,15.0,2015,Conference Paper,Strategway: Web solutions for building public transportation routes using big geodata analysis,"We propose Strategway, a group of web solutions for public transportation route planning based on real geo-data obtained from city residents. The idea behind the solution is to use collected data about city residents' transportation needs (residents' preferences) and to build an optimal route network minimizing total cost of ownership. As transportation preferences of people are represented as a large set of geoobjects, machine learning algorithms were modified to take geodata specifics into account. Strategway includes the analytics core for data gathering, clustering and route design based on machine learning techniques. These features can be considered as contribution in smart algorithms for urban planning systems. Pseudocode of main algorithms with novel additions are represented in the paper as the results of some case studies. Future work is declared in the end to highlight the ways of contribution to the domain of analytics as a web service. © 2015 ACM.",Big data analytics; City; Decision support; GIS; Population preferences; Public transportation; Route planning,"Golubev A., Chechetkin I., Solnushkin K.S., Sadovnikova N., Parygin D., Shcherbakov M.",10.1145/2837185.2843851
116,13.0,2019,Article,Inferring Pedestrian Motions at Urban Crosswalks,"Robust prediction of pedestrian behavior is one of the most challenging problems for autonomous driving. Particularly, predicting pedestrian crossings at crosswalks is of considerable importance for avoiding accidents on the one hand and not unnecessarily slowing down traffic on the other hand. Traditional model-based motion tracking and prediction approaches have difficulties in capturing abrupt changes in motions, as humans can perform them. In this paper, an approach for predicting pedestrian motions that combines established motion tracking algorithms with data-driven methods is presented. The approach is built upon a hierarchical structure, where first, the intent of each pedestrian is classified. Then, the approach computes several qualitative metrics, such as time-to-cross, for the pedestrians classified as crossing. The approach is evaluated on a challenging urban data set collected for different types of crosswalks such as roundabouts and straight roads. The evaluation also provides a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed approach. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",Autonomous vehicles; decision making; machine learning; prediction methods,"Volz B., Mielenz H., Gilitschenski I., Siegwart R., Nieto J.",10.1109/TITS.2018.2827956
118,13.0,2016,Article,Automated urban travel interpretation: A bottom-up approach for trajectory segmentation,"Understanding travel behavior is critical for an effective urban planning as well as for enabling various context-aware service provisions to support mobility as a service (MaaS). Both applications rely on the sensor traces generated by travellers’ smartphones. These traces can be used to interpret travel modes, both for generating automated travel diaries as well as for real-time travel mode detection. Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also, segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the location traces. In order to address all these challenges a novel, state based bottom-up approach is proposed. This approach assumes a fixed atomic segment of a homogeneous state, instead of an event-based segment, and a progressive iteration until a new state is found. The research investigates how an atomic state-based approach can be developed in such a way that can work in real time, near-real time and offline mode and in different environmental conditions with their varying quality of sensor traces. The results show the proposed bottom-up model outperforms the existing event-based segmentation models in terms of adaptivity, flexibility, accuracy and richness in information delivery pertinent to automated travel behavior interpretation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Activity; Context; GPS; IMU; MaaS; Machine learning; Temporal calculi; Trajectory; Trip,"Das R.D., Winter S.",10.3390/s16111962
122,12.0,2019,Conference Paper,Safe reinforcement learning with scene decomposition for navigating complex urban environments,"Navigating urban environments represents a complex task for automated vehicles. They must reach their goal safely and efficiently while considering a multitude of traffic participants. We propose a modular decision making algorithm to autonomously navigate intersections, addressing challenges of existing rule-based and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. We first present a safe RL algorithm relying on a model-checker to ensure safety guarantees. To make the decision strategy robust to perception errors and occlusions, we introduce a belief update technique using a learning based approach. Finally, we use a scene decomposition approach to scale our algorithm to environments with multiple traffic participants. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms rule-based methods and reinforcement learning techniques on a complex intersection scenario. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Bouton M., Nakhaei A., Fujimura K., Kochenderfer M.J.",10.1109/IVS.2019.8813803
123,12.0,2019,Article,Smart mobile crowdsensing with urban vehicles: A deep reinforcement learning perspective,"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a promising sensing paradigm based on the mobile node which provides the solution with cost-effectiveness to perform urban data collection. To monitor the urban environment and facilitate the municipal administration, more and more applications adopt vehicles as participants to carry out MCS tasks. The performance of the applications highly depends on the sensing data which is influenced by the recruiting strategy on vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle selection algorithm to maximize the sensing range with limited cost while the vehicle selection problem was proved to be NP-complete. Specifically, we modeled the interaction between MCS server and candidate vehicles as a Markov decision process and formulated the maximum spatial temporal coverage (STC) optimization as a deep reinforcement learning process. The performance of our deep reinforcement learning-based vehicle selection (i.e., DRLVS) algorithm is evaluated with real trajectory dataset. The numerical result indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves an optimal solution and maximizes the STC. © 2019 IEEE.",deep reinforcement learning; Mobile crowdsensing; spatialoral coverage,"Wang C., Gaimu X., Li C., Zou H., Wang W.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905263
127,12.0,2016,Conference Paper,Using abstractions to solve opportunistic crime security games at scale,"In this paper, we aim to deter urban crime by recommending optimal police patrol strategies against opportunistic criminals in large scale urban problems. While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

189,6.0,2018,Conference Paper,Detecting Transportation Modes Based on LightGBM Classifier from GPS Trajectory Data,"Human travel behavior can be obtained from the trajectory data generated by GPS devices, which can be reflected in different transportation modes and provide useful information for trajectory prediction, urban planning and traffic monitoring. In this article, we proposed transportation modes classification method based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to discover seven kinds of transportation modes from GPS trajectory data, including walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a taxi, driving a car, taking the subway and taking a train. First, the original trajectories must be divided into some sub trajectories. There is only one transportation mode label in each sub trajectory. Second, the feature vector of sub trajectory is computed including eight basic and three advanced features. These basic features are distance feature, five velocity-related features and two acceleration-related features. Three advanced features are heading change rate (hcr), stop rate (sr) and velocity change rate (vcr), Final, the LightGBM classifier is used to detect the transportation modes automatically. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and decision tree are also used to verify the efficiency of our method. The experiment data are Geolife provided by Microsoft Research Asia. The results show that the LightGBM and XGBoost methods are more accurate than decision tree method and the LightGBM is better than XGBoost at the classification of car, subway and train. © 2018 IEEE.",GPS; LighGBM; Machine learning; Trajectory data; Transportation mode,"Wang B., Wang Y., Qin K., Xia Q.",10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2018.8557149
192,6.0,2016,Conference Paper,Concept of interactive machine learning in urban design problems,"This work presents a concept of interactive machine learning in a human design process. An urban design problem is viewed as a multiple-criteria optimization problem. The outlined feature of an urban design problem is the dependence of a design goal on a context of the problem. We model the design goal as a randomized fitness measure that depends on the context. In terms of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), the defined measure corresponds to a subjective expected utility of a user. In the first stage of the proposed approach we let the algorithm explore a design space using clustering techniques. The second stage is an interactive design loop; the user makes a proposal, then the program optimizes it, gets the user's feedback and returns back the control over the application interface.",Interactive machine learning; MCDM; Multiplecriteria optimization; Urban design,"Chirkin A.M., König R.",10.1145/2898365.2899795
205,5.0,2019,Conference Paper,Attention based stack resnet for citywide traffic accident prediction,"The fine-grained citywide traffic accident prediction is of great significance for urban traffic management. Existing approaches mainly apply classic machine learning methods based on historical accident records. Thus they failed to involve the cross-domain data, which contains spatial and temporal dependency. Recently, with more cross-domain urban data available, leveraging the cross-domain data by deep learning algorithms to predict fine-grained accidents becomes possible, we propose an attention based ResNet framework to model the sophisticated correlation between urban data. © 2019 IEEE.",ResNet; spatio temporal patterns; Traffic accident prediction; Urban computing,Zhou Z.,10.1109/MDM.2019.00-27
207,5.0,2018,Article,A fuzzy logic based transport mode detection framework in urban environment,"Transport mode detection is an emerging research area in different domains such as urban planning, context-aware mobile computing, and intelligent transportation systems. Current approaches are mostly data-driven, based on machine learning approaches. However, machine learning models require substantial training data and cannot explain the reasoning procedure. Data-driven approaches also fall short while interpreting trajectories where ground truth information is limited. Therefore, this paper develops a novel knowledge-based approach for interpreting smartphone global positioning system trajectories by detecting various transport modes used during travel. The proposed model is based on an expert system that can work without any training, based solely on expert knowledge. Core is a fuzzy multiple-input multiple-output expert system using kinematic and spatial information with a well explained fuzzy reasoning scheme through a fuzzy rule base. The model can provide alternate predictions with varied certainty factors. Different membership function combinations have been evaluated in terms of accuracy and ambiguity, and the result demonstrates that the model performs best using a Gaussian–Gaussian combination, comparable to the existing machine learning approaches. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",Activity; expert system; fuzzy logic; GPS; mobility; smartphone; trajectory; transport mode; travel; uncertainty,"Das R.D., Winter S.",10.1080/15472450.2018.1436968
218,5.0,2011,Article,Procedural lot generation for evolutionary urban layout optimization in urban regeneration decision support,"Decision support in urban regeneration planning involves fulfilment of complex design objectives that require a close collaboration between stakeholders, designers and planners. The objectives are to achieve computationally optimized design plans that are environmentally robust and sustainable. For the purpose of pre-planning analysis and optimization of such design models, the construction framework of the whole system development life cycle is simulated using specialist analysis tools. In the analysis and design phase of such a construction process, location allocation of built environment structures integrated with AI based urban assessment models remain a cumbersome task. With the advent of sophisticated computing hardware and 3D modelling techniques, it has become viable to visualize and develop simulation outcomes with ease over standard computers. However, creation of simulated outcomes with huge urban details still remains a daunting task. With the advent of knowledge-based data standards and mining techniques, possibilities have arisen to integrate procedural urban modelling frameworks with socio-economic deprivation assessment systems to create massive city models in order to improve sustainability and smart growth. The implementation of a procedural modelling framework offers a promising area of research in location allocation optimization of residential and public service structures for urban regeneration planning and collaboration purposes but is still largely stochastic in nature until now. The work presented in this article proposes an L-system-based automated urban layout generation module in addition to an evolutionary building placement optimization system for the purpose of urban regeneration decision support. The location allocation optimization of a highly accessible pedestrian and street network grid still remains a complex process especially with neighbourhoods suffering from severe socio-economic deprivation. Using an extension to 'L-systems', the module utilizes an 'mBPMOL' system to recursively subdivide an urban regeneration layout and later encode the layout to a genetic chromosome to iteratively place a range of urban structures to the lots. Moving further, the system implements a distance-based socio-economic deprivation minimization fitness function and assesses subsequent individual genetic solutions to search for an optimized layout. The development of such an online procedural framework is a very first attempt to employ the capabilities of procedural automation with evolutionary computation to automatically generate and optimize the placement of a large number of building models. The outcome achieved a set of relatively optimal solutions with evaluation based upon a distance-based fitness objective function of various public service structures. The solutions (layout plans) thus obtained offered a number of moderate to highly accessible alternatives. Development of such a system is meant to facilitate decision support and improve time efficiency among urban designers and planners. © 2011 The authors.",Artificial Intelligence; Built Environment; Genetic Algorithms; Urban Planning; Urban Regeneration,"Yusuf S.A., Georgakis P., Nwagboso C.",
219,4.0,2021,Article,Effective task scheduling algorithm with deep learning for Internet of Health Things (IoHT) in sustainable smart cities,"In the recent years, important key factor for urban planning is to analyze the sustainability and its functionality towards smart cities. Presently, many researchers employ the conservative machine learning based analysis but those are not appropriate for IoT based health data analysis because of their physical feature extraction and low accuracy. In this paper, we propose remote health monitoring and data analysis by integrating IoT and deep learning concepts. We proposed novel IoT based FoG assisted cloud network architecture that accumulates real-time health care data from patients via several medical IoT sensor networks, these data are analyzed using a deep learning algorithm deployed at Fog based Healthcare Platform. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is applied to the sustainable smart cities to evaluate the process for real-time.

236,4.0,2018,Conference Paper,Knowledge-based learning for solving vehicle routing problem,"In this study, we have developed a method that applies machine learning in combination with an optimization heuristic algorithm such as a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Further, we developed a knowledge-based algorithm for a knowledge learning system. The algorithm learns to classify coordinates (unlabeled) into regions. Consequently, dividing routing calculations into regions (clusters) provides many benefits over traditional methods, and can result in an improvement in routing cost over the traditional company method by up to 25.68% and over the classical GA by up to 8.10%. It is also shown that our proposed method can reduce traveling distance compared to previous methods. Finally, the prediction of future customer regions has an accuracy of up to 0.72 for the predicted unlabeled customer coordinates.

240,4.0,2018,Article,Inference of vehicular traffic in smart cities using machine learning with the internet of things,"A rapidly increasing world population is not only directly related with increased urban mobility but also traffic delays, losses in fuel, air and noise pollution as well as physiological and psychological problems in the population. Traffic control has been shown to be a means of maintaining road serviceability with a key input being traffic inference. The harvesting of sufficiently large data sets for traffic inference has thus far been a challenge examined by the scientific community. A modelling, interactive design approach to the harvesting and preprocessing of vehicular data can be used to bridge the gap for traffic control to be autonomously implementable in an urban context. With this consideration, this paper explores the implementation of an internet of things multiagent system, in a network and equipped with sensors, distributed along the roadway to collect and share this vehicular data among its nodes and then process the data using a machine learning algorithm for learning and subsequent inference of vehicular types. An interactive design approach is used in the creation of a reduced model of knowledge from each node’s bulk harvested data, which is then easily stored or deployed and which also facilitates post-processing of data. Considering the smart city as a product, the interactive approach to product engineering permits the implementation of these mathematical models as part of an interactive traffic control system, to ensure the city’s adaptability to the ever-changing needs of its inhabitants. In this paper, we present the analysis of the trivial case of the detection of presence and absence of a class A type vehicle. In the introductory section, we examine the problem of transportation in urban expansion. In section two, we examine the solution provided by the Smart Cities with respect to transport services. Further problems which appear within these transport services and their respective solutions in machine learning and the internet of things are discussed in this section on these disruptive technologies. Section three examines the bibliography for successes achieved with similar research and also demonstrates the basis for classification by support vector machines. Sections four to six explain how the experiment is set up to test the hypothesis that over 99% accuracy in vehicular detection can be achieved with the proposed system when cross-referenced with the actual acoustic, magnetic and video presence and absence of a test vehicle. © 2017, Springer-Verlag France.",Big data; Intelligent traffic systems; Internet of things; Machine learning; Smart cities,"Reid A.R., Pérez C.R.C., Rodríguez D.M.",10.1007/s12008-017-0404-1
261,3.0,2019,Conference Paper,Utilizing Big Data for Enhancing Passenger Safety in Railway Stations,"In light of the increasing demand and capacity in the railway industry, it is imperative to maintain safety in relation to the complexities of the substantial railway stations. Thus, it is important to take note of the time where investments in new technologies directed at the safety of the railway enable safety and protection in this area. Novel technological techniques such as big data analysis (BDA), data mining or machine learning (ML) have been developed and applied in many areas such as sales, banking and healthcare. The development of such methods has important benefits within the context of railway safety, however, these new methods need to be implemented and developed with consideration of whether these operational models can help to solve the various difficulties that currently exist in the risk analysis of railway stations. Moreover, as the adoption of the Internet of thing (IoT) grows, it is expected that analytical needs for handling data will also increase. It has been shown that the progression towards automation and applying such innovative new technologies such as BDA may be a powerful tool for integration in the future of transportation in general and the railway industry in particular, whereby analytical predictions can aid in the development of safer railway stations which have greater potential for ensuring the safety of passengers. In this paper a Bow Tie (BT) framework model has been created to combine BDA into the risk assessment process. The BDA can be beneficial to the risk assessment, support the decision makers in real time, and reduce human errors. This method can be fully integrated into passenger data and the business model for the railway station. Employing the existing safety records utilizing BDA is expected to mitigate risks, predict hazards, raise safety and security efficiency and reduce the cost. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Alawad H., Kaewunruen S., Min A.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/5/052031

298,2.0,2020,Conference Paper,Spatiotemporal Variation of Taxi Demand,"The growth of urban areas has made taxi service become increasingly more popular due to its ubiquity and flexibility when compared with, more rigid, public transportation modes. However, in big cities taxi service is still unbalanced, resulting in inefficiencies such as long waiting times and excessive vacant trips. This paper presents an exploratory taxi fleet service analysis and compares two forecast models aimed at predicting the spatiotemporal variation of short-term taxi demand. For this paper, we used a large sample with more than 1 million trips between 2014 and 2017, representing roughly 10% of Lisbon's fleet. We analysed the spatiotemporal variation between pick-up and drop-off locations and how they are affected by weather conditions and points of interest. More, based on historic data, we built two models to predict the demand, ARIMA and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and evaluated and compared the performance of both models. This study not only allows the direct comparison of a linear statistical model with a machine learning one, but also leads to a better comprehension of complex interactions surrounding different urban data sources using the taxi service as a probe to better understand urban mobility-on-demand and its needs. © 2020 The Authors.

299,2.0,2020,Book Chapter,Secure blockchain-based traffic load balancing using edge computing and reinforcement learning,"Congestion represents one of the major problems in constantly growing cities, and the expansion and modernization of the traffic system are a major priority to all government infrastructures. In effect, more efficient traffic represents a more efficient economy. Solving the issue of congestion by increasing the number of roads is not always the most cost-effective solution as it represents massive changes in city infrastructures that have been present for decades. Urban planning shapes the environment around us but fails to address specifically the future traffic clogging. Our research tackles the problem of traffic congestion by proposing a system for vehicle detection, identification, and count, allied with reinforcement learning for traffic congestion anticipation and prediction. The need for a real-time and efficient system led us to push the research and development onto an Edge Computing platform using IoT and secure transactions using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Blockchain intervenes as a security protocol in the proposed system. The native form of Internet of Things does not include security protocols which are important to a large scale implementation. Ensuring the security of transactions and permanent access control is the main reason why blockchain is rooted in our system architecture. Our project aims to reduce the traffic load on roads experiencing significant congestion, and improve overall city traffic system without costly investment into new communication infrastructures and city planning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Blockchain; Containerization; Edge computing; Hyperledger fabric; Machine learning; Traffic congestion,"Tiba K., Parizi R.M., Zhang Q., Dehghantanha A., Karimipour H., Choo K.-K.R.",10.1007/978-3-030-38181-3_6
305,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,Participatory AI: Reducing AI bias and developing socially responsible AI in smart cities,"As smart cities evolve, artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be used to manage decisions for how cities operate. For everything from incarceration sentencing, city pension appropriation, surveillance and infrastructure management, AI will play a role. The author argues that implementing AI for a smart city should be decided similarly to how cities decide on major infrastructural planning projects. For both, there are social and ethical implications of deployment. A protocol is proposed for smart city AI so that AI can be seen as an ethical and trustworthy city asset rather than an adversary fraught with controversy and bias. This is achieved through participatory AI - the marriage of a fully transparent data architecture, such as the blockchain, and the urban planning practice of participatory planning. The diversity of opinions that participatory AI affords enables cities to facilitate socially responsible AI outcomes. © 2019 IEEE.",AI Bias; Blockchain; Participatory Planning; Responsible AI; Smart Cities,Falco G.,10.1109/CSE/EUC.2019.00038
310,2.0,2019,Article,Predicting safe parking spaces: A machine learning approach to geospatial urban and crime data,"This research aims to identify spatial and time patterns of theft in Manhattan, NY, to reveal urban factors that contribute to thefts from motor vehicles and to build a prediction model for thefts. Methods include time series and hot spot analysis, linear regression, elastic-net, Support vector machines SVM with radial and linear kernels, decision tree, bagged CART, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting. Machine learning methods reveal that linear models perform better on our data (linear regression, elastic-net), specifying that a higher number of subway entrances, graffiti, and restaurants on streets contribute to higher theft rates from motor vehicles. Although the prediction model for thefts meets almost all assumptions (five of six), its accuracy is 77%, suggesting that there are other undiscovered factors making a contribution to the generation of thefts. As an output demonstrating final results, the application prototype for searching safer parking in Manhattan, NY based on the prediction model, has been developed. © 2019 by the authors.",Crime prevention through urban planning; Geospatial data; Machine learning; Manhattan; Prediction model; Theft from motor vehicle,"Matijosaitiene I., McDowald A., Juneja V.",10.3390/su11102848
311,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,A user monitoring road traffic information collection using sumo and scheme for road surveillance with deep mind analytics and human behavior tracking,"Road congestion and huge traffic on roads has become a big problem in many urban areas. Investment on planning and processing of traffic information should help to minimize congestion and pollution. So here we propose a way to design our own road networks as required to reduce traffic using a tool called Sumo. Inorder to find the efficiency of that network, a WSN based framework is designed for the same and various routing schemes are applied on it. A fuzzy logic-based traffic light control system and QOS parameters handling system is designed by extracting data available by routing schemes applied. Inorder to make the roads safer artificial intelligence-based security cameras hoping to achieve automated recognition of people and events is planned. Digital brains map the eyes to analyze live video and helping responders to more easily find crimes and accidents on roads. Machine learning is employed to get considerable gains in its ability to identify objects, the skill of analyzing scenes, activities, and movements. Simulations have shown good performance for the proposed routing schemes and fuzzy controller designed shows good results to the urban traffic network. © 2019 IEEE.",Multiattribute decision-making (MADM); Open street map (OSM); Simple additive weighting product (SAW); Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO); Weighting product (WP),"Vachan B.R., Mishra S.",10.1109/ICCCBDA.2019.8725761
316,2.0,2019,Conference Paper,Automating layout synthesis with constructive preference elicitation,"Layout synthesis refers to the problem of arranging objects subject to design preferences and structural constraints. Applications include furniture arrangement, space partitioning (e.g. subdividing a house into rooms), urban planning, and other design tasks. Computer-aided support systems are essential tools for architects and designers to produce custom, functional layouts. Existing systems, however, do not learn the designer’s preferences, and therefore fail to generalize across sessions or instances. We propose addressing layout synthesis by casting it as a constructive preference elicitation task. Our solution employs a coactive interaction protocol, whereby the system and the designer interact by mutually improving each other’s proposals. The system iteratively recommends layouts to the user, and learns the user’s preferences by observing her improvements to the recommendations. We apply our system to two design tasks, furniture arrangement and space partitioning, and report promising quantitative and qualitative results on both.

317,2.0,2018,Article,Towards typogenetic tools for generative urban aesthetics,"Purpose: Urban typogenetics investigates the use of machine intelligence for the evaluation of performance measures as a decision support system (DSS) with a focus on urban aesthetics evaluation. This framework allows designers to address performance measures, urban measures and aesthetic criteria in an adaptive, interactive generative design approach. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the structure and the nature of the framework and the application of human-in-the-loop design systems to urban design. Design/methodology/approach: Significant literature reviewed lead to the identification of an application potential in the decision-making process. This potential is situated around the use of AI for the evaluation of subjective performance criteria in a DSS. Recognising that the key decisions about urban aesthetics are based on the individual evaluation of the designer, an HITL approach for computational design software to support creative decisions is presented in this paper. Findings: Urban typogenetics for interactive generative urban design allows the exploration of complex design spaces by using a human-in-the-loop design system in the context of urban aesthetics. Hybrid aesthetic evaluation allows the designer to analyse morphological features and urban aesthetics during exploratory search and reveal hidden aspects of the urban context by visualisation of the results of the aesthetic evaluation. Integrating performance measures and urban aesthetics in urban typogenetics addresses major criteria of urban design at the beginning of the creative process. Originality/value: The use of a broad interactive approach to typogenetic design in an application to urban scenarios is a novel conceptual approach to the design of urban configurations. The suggested adaptive mechanism would allow the user of a typogenetic tool to subjectively evaluate solutions by sight and reason about aesthetic, social and cultural implication of the reviewed design solutions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Early design stages; Evolutionary urbanism; Exploratory search; Generative design; Typogenetic design; Urban aesthetics,Muehlbauer M.,10.1108/SASBE-10-2017-0052

335,1.0,2021,Review,Research on the big data of traditional taxi and online car-hailing: A systematic review,"The purpose of this paper is to provide a summary of a quick overview of the latest developments and unprecedented opportunities for scholars who want to set foot in the field of traditional taxi and online car-hailing (TTOC). From the perspectives of peoples (e.g., passenger, driver, and policymaker), vehicle, road, and environment, this paper describes the current research status of TTOC's big data in six hot topics, including the ridership factor, spatio-temporal distribution and travel behavior, cruising strategy and passenger service market partition, route planning, transportation emission and new-energy, and TTOC's data extensional application. These topics were included in five mainstreams as follows: (1) abundant studies often focus only on determinant analysis on given transportation (taxi, transit, online car-hailing); the exploration of ridership patterns for a multi-modal transportation mode is rare; furthermore, multiple aspects of factors were not considered synchronously in a wide time span; (2) travel behavior research mainly concentrates on the commuting trips and distribution patterns of various travel indices (e.g., distance, displacement, time); (3) the taxi driver-searching strategy can be divided into autopsychic cruising and system dispatching; (4) the spatio-temporal distribution character of TTOC's fuel consumption (FC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a hotspot recently, and there has been a recommendation for electric taxi (ET) in urban cities to decrease transportation congestion is proposed; and (5) based on TTOC and point of interest (POI) multi-source data, many machine learning algorithms were used to predict travel condition indices, land use, and travel behavior. Then, the main bottlenecks and research directions that can be explored in the future are discussed. We hope this result can provide an overview of current fundamental aspects of TTOC's utilization in the urban area. © 2021 The Authors",Cruising strategy and route planning; Ridership factor; Service market partition; Traffic engineering; Transportation emission and new-energy; Travel behavior,"Lyu T., Wang P.S., Gao Y., Wang Y.",10.1016/j.jtte.2021.01.001
339,1.0,2021,Conference Paper,EquiTensors: Learning Fair Integrations of Heterogeneous Urban Data,"Neural methods are state-of-the-art for urban prediction problems such as transportation resource demand, accident risk, crowd mobility, and public safety. Model performance can be improved by integrating exogenous features from open data repositories (e.g., weather, housing prices, traffic, etc.), but these uncurated sources are often too noisy, incomplete, and biased to use directly. We propose to learn integrated representations, called EquiTensors, from heterogeneous datasets that can be reused across a variety of tasks. We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with ""oracle""models that use hand-selected datasets. © 2021 ACM.",data integration; fairness in machine learning; neural networks; open data; spatial-temporal predictions,"Yan A., Howe B.",10.1145/3448016.3452777
353,1.0,2020,Article,"Exploring the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership, using both inferential and machine learning approaches","Ride-sourcing services are getting more popular each year, and their markets are growing. Much has been speculated, but not much has been tested regarding the impacts of ride-sourcing services on the transportation system. In this study, we examine the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership of households, by using the most up-to-date (2017) national household travel survey data. To better capture the effect of ride-sourcing services on vehicle ownership, we controlled for the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of households and built environment variables, i.e., density, diversity, design, and distance to transit. Two approaches were used to model vehicle ownership: a probabilistic or inferential model (i.e., multilevel Poisson), and a machine learning method (i.e., random forest). This is the first study to utilize such advanced methods to model vehicle ownership and capture non-linear relationships, using the largest sample of household travel records ever assembled for such a study. The results suggest that there is a negative correlation between using ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership. Vehicle ownership is also negatively associated with the number of years Uber, as the biggest ride-sourcing service, has operated in a county. The relative contributions of ride-sourcing variables, however, are very limited compared to other variables controlled in this study which makes intuitive sense. For urban planning and design practices, this study suggests that the probability of car shedding will increase if the usage of ride-sourcing services becomes a habit, these services become more available, and built environments become more dense, connected, and transit-served. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Machine learning; Multilevel modeling; Random forest; Ride-sourcing services; Uber; Vehicle ownership,"Sabouri S., Brewer S., Ewing R.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103797
357,1.0,2020,Article,Viewpoint: City Information Modelling (CIM) and Digitizing Urban Design Practices,"New developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital ubiquity bring revelations of emerging smart cities. However, urban designers are particularly reluctant to become digital and use software that automatically generates cities. Instead, they return to traditional design skills such as creating scale models, sketching, notations and drafting. There is an increasing advocacy for design to a human scale, placemaking and liveable cities. This viewpoint asks questions about the application of AI and generative algorithms in digitizing urban design practices. It reflects on the possibilities of conjoining urban morphology and design theory into City Information Modelling (CIM) as a new digital tool for urban designers and reveals challenges in the ongoing development of new CIM software. Urban designers work within intricate design worlds with toolboxes that consist of customized design elements and symbologies. The design worlds consist of elements, rules and paterns and they act as holding environments for their unique diagrammatic design knowledge. CIM and AI should understand design worlds with customized toolboxes and provide help to automate repetitive behaviour paterns while designing. © 2020, Built environment.

369,1.0,2019,Article,Combining design patterns and topic modeling to discover regions that support particular functionality,"The problem of discovering regions that support particular functionalities in an urban setting has been approached in literature using two general methodologies: top-down, encoding expert knowledge on urban planning and design and discovering regions that conform to that knowledge; and bottom-up, using data to train machine learning models, which can discover similar regions. Both methodologies face limitations, with knowledge-based approaches being criticized for scalability and transferability issues and data-driven approaches for lacking interpretability and depending heavily on data quality. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework that fuses a knowledge-based approach using design patterns and a data-driven approach using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in three different ways: Functional regions discovered using either approach are evaluated against each other to identify cases of significant agreement or disagreement; knowledge from patterns is used to adjust topic probabilities in the learning model; and topic probabilities are used to adjust pattern-based results. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated through the use case of identifying shopping-related regions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results show that the combination of pattern-based discovery and topic modeling extraction helps uncover discrepancies between the two approaches and smooth inaccuracies caused by the limitations of each approach. © 2019 by the authors.",Functional region; Patterns; Place; Topic modeling; Urban planning; Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI),"Papadakis E., Gao S., Baryannis G.",10.3390/ijgi8090385

In this chapter, we examine 24 of the latest wave of Accessibility Instruments (AIs) represented in COST Action TU1002 to assess their potential usability as planning support tools for transport and land use practitioners. We here describe their key features (background, conceptual framework, and theoretical underpinnings, operational aspects, relevance for planning practice, strengths and limitations, and visualization) in some detail and we reflect in a more nuanced way, as urban planners, on the data collected thought a survey, on how these instruments can most usefully be deployed to address land use and transport planning issues. We also describe the developer’s perception of usability collected through the same survey used for collecting the key features. We identify, per item, significant similarities and differences and reflect on potential implications for their usability in planning practice. Besides the Accessibility Instruments Survey, this chapter also uses data also from the AIs summary reports, which provide much richer information and explanation than the developer’s survey of how they anticipate their instruments could have a role in urban planning. The chapter is structured into six sections. The first section provides an overview of the background of the 24 AIs involved in this research, followed by a description of the role in urban and transport planning of the AIs. The third section concludes the debate around the key features of the 24 AIs going into detail on conceptual and operational issues, such as the conceptual framework and theoretical underpinnings, the operational characteristics, and the visualization of outputs. The fourth section provides a specific analysis of the developer’s perception of usability of their AIs. This is followed by a more general debate on the relevance of AIs for planning practice.

Existing strategies and practices within the traditional road traffic safety portfolio were identified, and recommendations for improvement were made in order to maximise the impact of these practices on road traffic safety. There was also a need to draw in role players outside the traditional safety sphere to commit time and funds towards the improvement of road traffic safety in the Province The methodology followed to develop the strategy consisted of a review of relevant documentation, an assessment of information systems and collection of data, interviews and discussions with role players on provincial, metropolitan and local levels within all related disciplines. The development of a Road Traffic Safety Management Strategy required a comprehensive analysis of the current road traffic safety situation in the Western Cape, as well as an assessment of the current approach to provincial management. The vision of the Western Cape Traffic Safety Management Strategy ""A Safer Road Environment for AI"" embraces the provincial vision for ""A Home for AII"", and the vision adopted by the Department of Community Safety, which is ""A Safer Home For AII"". The Strategy furthermore embraces the concept of Holistic Governance, with its pillars of Integrated, Co-operative and Responsive Governance. Specific thematic issues emanating from the analysis are addressed in the Strategy. They are: law enforcement; education and communication; engineering and land development; public transport; and health and emergency services. Operational objectives at regional level are defined.

417,,2021,Article,A data-driven agent-based simulation to predict crime patterns in an urban environment,"Spatial crime simulations contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that drive crime and can support decision-makers in developing effective crime reduction strategies. Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction. © 2021",2000 MSC: 91D25; 91D10; Agent-based models; Crime prediction; Data-driven models; Location-based social services; Open data; Simulation; Urban data,"Rosés R., Kadar C., Malleson N.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101660

464,,2021,Article,Smart Urban Mobility: When Mobility Systems Meet Smart Data,"Cities around the world are expanding dramatically, with urban population growth reaching nearly 2.5 billion people in urban areas and road traffic growth exceeding 1.2 billion cars by 2050. The economic contribution of the transport sector represents 5&#x0025; of the GDP in Europe and costs an average of US &#x0024;482.05 billion in the United States. These figures indicate the rapid rise of industrial cities and the urgent need to move from traditional cities to smart cities. This article provides a survey of different approaches and technologies such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that leverage communication technologies to help maintain road users safe while driving, as well as support autonomous mobility through the optimization of control systems. The role of ITS is strengthened when combined with accurate artificial intelligence models that are built to optimize urban planning, analyze crowd behavior and predict traffic conditions. AI-driven ITS is becoming possible thanks to the existence of a large volume of mobility data generated by billions of users through their use of new technologies and online social media. The optimization of urban planning enhances vehicle routing capabilities and solves traffic congestion problems, as discussed in this paper. From an ecological perspective, we discuss the measures and incentives provided to foster the use of mobility systems. We also underline the role of the political will in promoting open data in the transport sector, considered as an essential ingredient for developing technological solutions necessary for cities to become healthier and more sustainable.

508,,2020,Article,BISTRO: Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization,"The current trend toward urbanization and adoption of flexible and innovative mobility technologies will have complex and difficult-to-predict effects on urban transportation systems. Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design. This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO's utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices. © 2020 ACM.",Agent-based models; big data; computing with heterogeneous data; digital decision support systems; human mobility; intelligent transportation systems; smart cities; system dynamics; urban informatics,"Feygin S.A., Lazarus J.R., Forscher E.H., Golfier-Vetterli V., Lee J.W., Gupta A., Waraich R.A., Sheppard C.J.R., Bayen A.M.",10.1145/3384344

543,,2019,Conference Paper,Pedestrians Walking on Reachable Sets and Manifolds,"It is a challenge to find safe trajectories for automated vehicles. Especially in urban environments with pedestrians there exist many different situations. The prediction of future movements with absolute certainty is impossible if the intention of the pedestrian is unknown. This paper is intended to offer a new concept of decision-making for motion planning with vulnerable road-users in urban environments. Reachability analysis is used to define spatial areas based on physical constraints, where the pedestrian might go. The approach is physically inspired and it can be proven for all kind of pedestrians. A new approach to cluster spatial areas is introduced to store specific environmental information about the pedestrian. The maximum values for jerk, acceleration and velocity of the pedestrian are necessary to find reachable areas. © 2019 IEEE.",Automated Vehicles; Machine Learning; Motion Planning; Pedestrian; Reachability Analysis; Safety; Vehicles,"Hartmann M., Watzenig D.",10.1109/ICMECH.2019.8722888

Although the research recognises not all design is numerically quantifiable, it posits that certain aspects are. It provides evidence of algorithmically derived solutions-in many cases-being as good as those developed by a design professional. I situate the research within a series of examples of design quantification and description. Before discussing practical implementations of algorithmic spatial planning by the co-work start-up WeWork. These projects demonstrate an ongoing narrative to establish spatial syntactical rules for building and urban design. Finally, the paper reports on original research that aims to apply algorithmic space planning to urban design. A work-in-progress, at this stage the finding report on our methodology, preliminary implementation of an algorithmic strategy.

582,,2016,Conference Paper,Procedural urban environments for FPS games,"This paper presents a novel approach to procedural generation of urban maps for First Person Shooter (FPS) games. A multi-agent evolutionary system is employed to place streets, buildings and other items inside the Unity3D game engine, resulting in playable video game levels. A computational agent is trained using machine learning techniques to capture the intent of the game designer as part of the multi-agent system, and to enable a semi-automated aesthetic selection for the underlying genetic algorithm.

593,,2009,Book Chapter,The construction game,"Technologies for video games have advanced dramatically over the past decade, revolutionising the motion picture, game and multimedia industries. Similar technologies, such as virtual reality and digital modelling, have been used in the construction domain; examples can be found in urban planning and city modelling. The nD game project, by the University of Salford, developed a computer game to inspire younger generations into the construction industry. With modern games technology becoming more and more sophisticated, and the vast amount of technologies that have been developed during the game development, this chapter explores the opportunities to apply gaming technology in the construction arena. Technologies such as game artificial intelligence (AI) and behavioural modelling for construction simulation, massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) for the virtual construction site, and interactive games for construction training are discussed. © 2009 Editorial Matter - Geoffrey Qiping Shen, Peter Brandon and Andrew Baldwin.

600,,1988,Article,"Location, design, and operation of accident investigation sites in urban freeway corridors","In this paper, current recommendations for locating, designing, and operating Accident Investigation Sites (AISs) in urban freeway corridors are summarized. The recommendations are based on (a) interviews with freeway corridor traffic management teams in Texas and (b) experiences of the authors. The guidelines can be summarized as follows: The AIS locations must be easily accessible from the freeway. The most desirable location is within one block of the freeway exit ramp terminals. Local police should be involved in locating and esigning AISs. An AIS should be paved, illuminated, have a minimum of 1,000 ft2, and be equipped with some form of telephone communications system. It is better to install AISs as part of a citywide freeway incident management program involving traffic engineers and law enforcement personnel.",,"Dudek Conrad L., McCasland W.R., Burns E.Nels",
