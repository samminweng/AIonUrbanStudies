1,594.0,2000,Article,The city and the car,"The social sciences have generally ignored the motor car and its awesome consequences for social life, especially in their analysis of the urban. Urban studies in particular has failed to consider the overwhelming impact of the automobile in transforming the time-space 'scapes' of the modern urban/suburban dweller. Focusing on forms of mobility into, across and through the city, we consider how the car reconfigures urban life, involving distinct ways of dwelling, travelling and socializing in, and through, an automobilized time-space. We trace urban sociology's paradoxical resistance to cultures of mobility, and argue that civil society should be reconceptualized as a 'civil society of automobility'. We then explore how automobility makes instantaneous time and the negotiation of extensive space central to how social life is configured. As people dwell in and socially interact through their cars, they become hyphenated car-drivers: at home in movement, transcending distance to complete a series of activities within fragmented moments of time. Urban social life has always entailed various mobilities but the car transforms these in a distinct combination of flexibility and coercion. Automobility is a complex amalgam of interlocking machines, social practices and ways of dwelling which have reshaped citizenship and the public sphere via the mobilization of modern civil societies. In the conclusion we trace a vision of an evolved automobility for the cities of tomorrow in which public space might again be made 'public'.",,"Sheller M., Urry J.",10.1111/1468-2427.00276
2,357.0,2010,Article,The relation between perceived sensory dimensions of urban green space and stress restoration,"Research indicates a relationship between sensory perception of natural environments and human health. Our hypothesis is that people perceive green spaces in terms of certain dimensions, where some dimensions are more important and preferred than others with respect to restoring people from stress. The aims are to: identify and describe the perceived dimensions in nature; identify which dimensions people in general prefer; identify the dimensions people reporting stress prefer; and identify a combination of the dimensions people reporting stress prefer. A total of 953 randomly selected informants from nine Swedish cities (representative of the Swedish population) answered a postal questionnaire with pre-coded questions. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: personal data, preferences for natural qualities and self-estimations of health status. The data were analyzed using factor analysis and regression analyses. The results identify and describe eight perceived sensory dimensions. People in general prefer the dimension Serene, followed by Space, Nature, Rich in Species, Refuge, Culture, Prospect and Social. The dimensions Refuge and Nature are most strongly correlated with stress, indicating a need to find the most restorative environments. A combination of Refuge, Nature and Rich in Species, and a low or no presence of Social, could be interpreted as the most restorative environment for stressed individuals. From a city planning perspective, the results indicate how urban green spaces can be viewed as elements of importance to public mental health. However, before the dimensions can be used by practitioners as tools to promote health through city planning, more research is needed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

3,308.0,2008,Review,People needs in the urban landscape: Analysis of Landscape And Urban Planning contributions,"The articles published in Landscape and Urban Planning during the past 16 years provide valuable insights into how humans interact with outdoor urban environments. This review paper explores the wide spectrum of human dimensions and issues, or human needs, addressed by 90 of these studies. As a basis for analysis, the major themes tapped by the findings were classified into two overarching groups containing three categories each. The Nature needs, directly linked with the physical features of the environmental setting, were categorized in terms of contact with nature, aesthetic preference, and recreation and play. The role of the environment is less immediate in the Human-interaction group, which includes the issues of social interaction, citizen participation in the design process, and community identity. Most significantly, the publications offer strong support for the important role nearby natural environments play in human well-being. Urban settings that provide nature contact are valuable not only in their own right, but also for meeting other needs in a manner unique to these more natural settings. In addition, although addressed in different ways, remarkable similarities exist concerning these six people requirements across diverse cultures and political systems. Urban residents worldwide express a desire for contact with nature and each other, attractive environments, places in which to recreate and play, privacy, a more active role in the design of their community, and a sense of community identity. The studies reviewed here offer continued evidence that the design of urban landscapes strongly influences the well-being and behavior of users and nearby inhabitants. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

4,303.0,1999,Article,Typhoid fever in children aged less than 5 years,"Background. Calculation of the incidence of typhoid fever during preschool years is important to define the optimum age of immunisation and the choice of vaccines for public-health programmes in developing countries. Hospital-based studies have suggested that children younger than 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever, but this view needs to be re-examined in community-based longitudinal studies. We undertook a prospective follow-up study of residents of a low-income urban area of Delhi, India, with active surveillance for case detection. Methods. A baseline census was undertaken in 1995. Between Nov 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 1996, we visited 8172 residents of 1820 households in Kalkaji, Delhi, twice weekly to detect febrile cases. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings. 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases were detected. Of these, 28 (44%) were in children aged under 5 years. The incidence rate of typhoid per 1000 person-years was 27.3 at age under 5 years, 11.7 at 5-19 years, and 1.1 between 19 and 40 years. The difference in the incidence of typhoid fever between those under 5 years and those aged 5-19 years (15.6 per 1000 person-years [95% CI 4.7-26.5]), and those aged 19-40 years (26.2 [16.0-36.3]) was significant (p < 0.001 far both). The difference between the incidence of typhoid at 5-19 years and the incidence at 19-40 years was also significant (10.6 [6.3-14.8], p < 0 001). Morbidity in those under 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and need for hospital admission. Interpretation. Our findings challenge the common view that typhoid fever is a disorder of school-age children and of adults. Typhoid is a common and significant cause of morbidity between 1 and 5 years of age. The optimum age of typhoid immunisation and the choice of vaccines needs to be reassessed.This study was conducted to measure the incidence of typhoid fever among preschoolers. It was suggested that children aged 5 years do not need vaccination against typhoid fever. However, it is important to re-examine this view, particularly in infants and young children in the low-income urban area of Delhi, India, through active surveillance. Blood samples were obtained from febrile patients, and those who tested positive for Salmonella typhi were treated with ciprofloxacin. Findings revealed 63 culture-positive typhoid fever cases, about 44% of which were in children under 5 years of age. Morbidity in children under age 5 and in older people was similar in terms of duration of fever, signs and symptoms, and the need for hospital admission. The incidence of typhoid fever and the age distribution of the case varied between developing countries. Thus, the age patterns of typhoid fever observed in the urban study area may differ in rural areas within India or in other developing countries. A reevaluation of the optimum age and vaccine of choice is needed.",,"Sinha A., Sazawal S., Kumar R., Sood S., Reddaiah V.P., Singh B., Rao M., Naficy A., Clemens J.D., Bhan M.K.",10.1016/S0140-6736(98)09001-1
5,216.0,2016,Article,Ten questions on the soundscapes of the built environment,"Soundscape research represents a paradigm shift from noise control policies towards a new multidisciplinary approach as it involves not only physical measurements but also the cooperation of humanity and social sciences to account for the diversity of soundscapes across countries and cultures, with more focus on how people actually experience the acoustic environments; and it considers environmental sounds as a 'resource' rather than a 'waste'. The ten questions presented in this paper range from the very basic definitions underlying the emerging soundscape science, to more applied topics about how to use soundscape as a design approach for the planning and management of the built environments. Although significant research activity has been conducted so far, there is still a need to systematically provide the underpinning science and practical guidance in soundscaping. Thus, the last question aims to identify the most crucial gaps in soundscape research and set the agenda for future advancements in the field. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Acoustic environment; Environmental noise; Quality of life; Soundscape; Urban sound planning,"Kang J., Aletta F., Gjestland T.T., Brown L.A., Botteldooren D., Schulte-Fortkamp B., Lercher P., van Kamp I., Genuit K., Fiebig A., Bento Coelho J.L., Maffei L., Lavia L.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.08.011
6,191.0,2005,Article,The transnational capitalist class and contemporary architecture in globalizing cities,"The focus of this article is on the role of the transnational capitalist class (TCC) in and around architecture in the production and marketing of iconic buildings and spaces, in global or world cities. The TCC is conceptualized in terms of four fractions: (1) Those who own and/or and control the major transnational corporations and their local affiliates (corporate fraction). In architecture these are the major architectural, architecture-engineering and architecture-developer-real estate firms. In comparison with the major global consumer goods, energy and financial corporations the revenues of the biggest firms in the architecture industry are quite small. However, their importance for the built environment and their cultural importance, especially in cities, far outweighs their relative lack of financial and corporate muscle. (2) Globalizing politicians and bureaucrats (state fraction). These are the politicians and bureaucrats at all levels of administrative power and responsibility who actually decide what gets built where, and how changes to the built environment are regulated. (3) Globalizing professionals (technical fraction). The members of this fraction range from the leading technicians centrally involved in the structural features of new building to those responsible for the education of students and the public in architecture. (4) Merchants and media (consumerist fraction). These are the people who are responsible for the marketing of architecture in all its manifestations. (There is obviously some overlap between the membership of these fractions.). My conclusion is that many global and aspiring global cities have looked to iconic architecture as a prime strategy of urban intervention, often in the context of rehabilitation of depressed areas. The attempt to identify the agents most responsible for this transformation, namely the TCC, and to explain how they operate, suggests that deliberately iconic architecture is becoming a global phenomenon, specifically a central urban manifestation of the culture-ideology of consumerism. © Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.",,Sklair L.,10.1111/j.1468-2427.2005.00601.x
7,186.0,2005,Article,Beyond binary choices: Integrating individual and social creativity,"The power of the unaided individual mind is highly overrated. Although society often thinks of creative individuals as working in isolation, intelligence and creativity result in large part from interaction and collaboration with other individuals. Much human creativity is social, arising from activities that take place in a context in which interaction with other people and the artifacts that embody collective knowledge are essential contributors. This paper examines: (1) how individual and social creativity can be integrated by means of proper collaboration models and tools supporting distributed cognition; (2) how the creation of shareable externalizations (""boundary objects"") and the adoption of evolutionary process models in the construction of meta-design environments can enhance creativity and support spontaneous design activities (""unselfconscious cultures of design""); and (3) how a new design competence is emerging - one that requires passage from individual creative actions to synergetic activities, from the reflective practitioner to reflective communities and from given tasks to personally meaningful activities. The paper offers examples in the context of collaborative design and art practice, including urban planning, interactive art and open source. In the effort to draw a viable path ""beyond binary choices"", the paper points out some major challenges for the next generation of socio-technical environments to further increase the integration of individual and social creativity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

8,163.0,2001,Article,Capitalising on multiplicity: A transdisciplinary systems approach to landscape research,"Different disciplines have landscape as the focal point of their research. They are successful in presenting new findings about landscapes within their specialisation, but collaboration - and thus, transfer of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries - is seldom realised because a common approach that bridges the gaps between disciplines is missing. Instead, different landscape concepts exist side by side. Yet, cooperation is required to tackle the various environmental and social problems related to landscapes. This paper provides an overview of the historical development of landscape concepts originating from different cultural and scientific trends, and presents a new complex concept of landscape, which is designed to enable transdisciplinary landscape research. The transdisciplinary landscape concept is based on five dimensions of landscapes: the spatial entity, the mental entity, the temporal dimension, the nexus of nature and culture, and the systemic properties of landscapes. In contrast to other approaches, it unites dimensions that are usually the domain of individual disciplines and makes it, thus, possible to capitalise on plurality in landscape research. The concept promotes landscape as the combination of the subsystems known as the geo-, bio- and noo-sphere, and is illustrated by the people-landscape interaction model. The concept can be applied to all human-landscape-related research, but is exemplified by two studies that have investigated the relationship between landscape and second-home tourism, and landscape and farming, respectively. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

9,125.0,2002,Article,Good looking: In defense of scenic landscape aesthetics,"Among US writers on environmental aesthetics, it has become de rigueur to leverage Aldo Leopold's legacy against the proliferation of ""popular"" landscape tastes, which are typically seen to have their origins in 17th-19th century European traditions of landscape painting and aesthetics. These writers regard victims of popular or ""scenic"" landscape tastes (exemplified by Olmsted's Central Park) as intellectually shallow, motivated by momentary ""sensory pleasures"", and passively and anthropocentrically drawn to ""naturalistic"" environments rather than actively and biocentrically engaged with natural environments. This implicit refusal to grant sensory information and affective processing the power to catalyze and inform serious reflection is not new; neither is the attribution of popular landscape aesthetics to the elite society of a limited culture and historical period surprising, given the current preponderance of post-modernist sensibilities. However, in the often highly-charged atmosphere of local environmental planning and management arenas, both positions are needlessly polemical. More importantly, there is good evidence to suggest that both positions are founded on misconceptions about how the human mind works. In this paper, we will review work that establishes the intellectual bona fides of visual imagery, the important contributions that emotions make to cognition, and the likelihood that explanations of environmental aesthetics rooted in European enlightenment-era landscape painting are inadequate. This review suggests that frequent calls for new normative environmental aesthetics based on a cognitive understanding of ecological sustainability are likely premature. As social scientists, we suggest that attempts to impose prescribed environmental aesthetics (albeit ecologically pure environmental aesthetics) are inappropriate and may well be self-defeating. Instead, we suggest that a thorough understanding of visual and non-visual environmental aesthetics is needed, including examinations of the possibility that affect elicited by scenic encounters with preferred landscapes can lead people to form emotional attachments to the land and thereby develop a greater appreciation for sustainability goals. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

10,111.0,2006,Article,"Place, culture, and the social amplification of risk","This article investigates the role of culture in the social production of risks and risk communication surrounding industrial development in a region located at a rural-urban interface. A case study examined a public consultation that was undertaken to inform local residents about an eco-industrial development proposal being planned near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The research employed the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) to examine the relationships among culture, place, and socially constructed risk. A total of 44 in-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 33 landowners (farmers, acreage owners), public officials (municipal politicians, administrators), journalists, and industry representatives. Analysis revealed that risk communication occurred in relation to situated experiences of place that were based on conflicting cultural worldviews. The research shows that place is a useful component of the SARF, providing a spatial explanation for why some people amplify, and others attenuate, risks in locally contentious environmental debates. © 2006 Society for Risk Analysis.",Culture; Geography; Place; Social amplification of risk,"Masuda J.R., Garvin T.",10.1111/j.1539-6924.2006.00749.x
11,110.0,2009,Article,Making friends in Zurich's urban forests and parks: The role of public green space for social inclusion of youths from different cultures,"Integrating the distinct cultures of foreign resident youths is a challenge for Swiss political and educational institutions. An empirical survey of pupils (n = 437) and teachers in selected schools of the city and metropolitan area of Zurich investigated leisure activities in urban forests and public green spaces for their potential to facilitate social interaction between Swiss and immigrant young people. Patterns of socialising and making friends in these outdoor locations were found to differ depending on age, school level, gender and the percentage of immigrants in each residential area. Public urban green spaces were found to play an important role for children and youths in making contacts and friends across cultures, which is considered a prerequisite for social inclusion. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

12,110.0,2003,Article,Visions of nature and landscape type preferences: An exploration in The Netherlands,"A survey was carried out among inhabitants of Gennep, a small-town municipality in the east of The Netherlands, questioning about (1) the types of nature that people distinguish and the levels of naturalness ascribed to these types of nature; (2) the images that people hold of the appropriate relationship between people and nature and the level of adherence to these images, and (3) people's preference of broadly defined landscape types. Types of nature inferred by means of factor analysis were labeled arcadian, wild and penetrative nature, the last category comprising elements such as mosquitoes and rats in the barn. Factor analysis was used as well to infer images of appropriate relationship, which appeared to hinge around the concepts of mastery over nature, responsibility for nature and participation in nature, respectively. Levels of adherence to the responsibility and participation images were very high, indicative of a 'new biophilia' mainstream in Dutch culture. Landscape types were defined, roughly, as (1) landscape made by and for people; (2) park-like, arcadian landscape; (3) wild, interactive landscape and (4) landscape ""in which one may experience the greatness and forces of nature"". Strikingly, more than half of the respondents expressed preference for this last ('deep ecology') landscape type, with another third preferring the wild, interactive landscape. The highest preference of the 'greatness and forces' landscape was found among the respondents with high ascription of naturalness to the penetrative type of nature and respondents adhering to the participation-in-nature image of relationship. Preferences for landscape types as defined here should be distinguished from visual or behavioral landscape preferences. Even if people may not select landscapes of the 'greatness and forces of nature' in daily behaviors, these landscapes of wilderness and greatness do connect with human visions and desires. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

13,107.0,2008,Article,Social impact assessment and public participation in China: A case study of land requisition in Guangzhou,"This study examines the current prospects for and obstacles facing the implementation of social impact assessment (SIA) and participatory planning in the People's Republic of China. During the past two decades, rapid urbanisation and the conversion of rural land for urban development have led to numerous social conflicts and tensions between the Chinese government and its people. SIA and public participation in development decisions have received increasing attention from the Chinese authorities as possible ways to tackle the problem. Based on a Guangzhou case study, this paper argues that the assessment and mitigation of adverse impacts on the community from urban development have been carried out with different objectives, core values and principles when compared with those in Western societies. It concludes that the poor prospects of SIA and collaborative planning in China lie not only in the weak framework for environmental legislation, but also in all institutions concerning state-society relations, the socialist governing ideology and traditional Chinese culture. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

16,98.0,2013,Article,"Evaluating the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating various outdoor urban environments in the hot dry city of Damascus, Syria","Consideration of urban microclimate and thermal comfort is an absolute neccessity in urban development, and a set of guidelines for every type of climate must be elaborated. However, to develop guidelines, thermal comfort ranges need to be defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of different thermal indices by investigating different thermal environments in Damascus during summer and winter. A second aim was to define the lower and upper limits of the thermal comfort range for some of these indices. The study was based on comprehensive micrometeorological measurements combined with questionnaires. It was found that the thermal conditions of different outdoor environments vary considerably. In general, Old Damascus, with its deep canyons, is more comfortable in summer than modern Damascus where there is a lack of shade. Conversely, residential areas and parks in modern Damascus are more comfortable in winter due to more solar access. The neutral temperatures of both the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and the outdoor standard effective temperature (OUT_SET*) were found to be lower in summer than in winter. At 80 % acceptability, the study defined the lower comfort limit in winter to 21.0 °C and the upper limit in summer to 31.3 °C for PET. For OUT_SET*, the corresponding lower and upper limits were 27.6 °C and 31.3 °C respectively. OUT_SET* showed a better correlation with the thermal sensation votes than PET. The study also highlighted the influence of culture and traditions on people's clothing as well as the influence of air conditioning on physical adaptation. © 2012 ISB.",Damascus; Microclimate; Thermal comfort; Thermal indices; Thermal sensation; Urban design,"Yahia M.W., Johansson E.",10.1007/s00484-012-0589-8

Singapore has undergone rapid urbanization after its independence in 1965, with a concomitant decline in natural habitat extent and accessibility. Using coastal mangrove forests as a case study habitat, changing cultural values were explored with a novel array of techniques, including qualitative archival analysis (photographs, oral histories), current sources (publically uploaded social media photographs), and surveys of (a) the general public and (b) visitors to publically accessible mangroves. Cultural value changed through time, with a significant transition from intrinsic, intrapersonal values (spiritual, cultural heritage) to instrumental, interpersonal values (recreation, education). Additionally, cultural value varied between different mangroves depending on their public accessibility, and the evolving degree of human interaction with the ecosystem as urban development occured. Cultural values change as development transitions, though mangroves still play an important cultural role in a heavily urbanized environment. © 2015, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",Coastal; Ecosystem services; Mangrove; Recreation; Singapore; Urbanization,"Thiagarajah J., Wong S.K.M., Richards D.R., Friess D.A.",10.1007/s13280-015-0647-7
23,66.0,2017,Book,Urban sustainability transitions,"The world’s population is currently undergoing a significant transition towards urbanisation, with the UN expecting that 70% of people globally will live in cities by 2050. Urbanisation has multiple political, cultural, environmental and economic dimensions that profoundly influence social development and innovation. This fundamental long-term transformation will involve the realignment of urban society’s technologies and infrastructures, culture and lifestyles, as well as governance and institutional frameworks. Such structural systemic realignments can be referred to as urban sustainability transitions: fundamental and structural changes in urban systems through which persistent societal challenges are addressed, such as shifts towards urban farming, renewable decentralised energy systems, and social economies. This book provides new insights into how sustainability transitions unfold in different types of cities across the world and explores possible strategies for governing urban transitions, emphasising the co-evolution of material and institutional transformations in socio-technical and socio-ecological systems. With case studies of mega-cities such as Seoul, Tokyo, New York and Adelaide, medium-sized cities such as Copenhagen, Cape Town and Portland, and nonmetropolitan cities such as Freiburg, Ghent and Brighton, the book provides an opportunity to reflect upon the comparability and transferability of theoretical/conceptual constructs and governance approaches across geographical contexts.

25,63.0,2015,Article,"Autonomous adaptation to global environmental change in peri-urban settlements: Evidence of a growing culture of innovation and revitalisation in Mathare Valley Slums, Nairobi","The growth of peri-urban areas is increasingly recognised as a dominant planning and urban design challenge for the 21st century. In burgeoning poor urban settlements growing on city margins, autonomous adaptation strategies are often the only measures to respond to increasing climatic and compounding stressors. Yet, in both research and practice there remains lack of understanding regarding the dynamics of adaptation and risk reduction at the level of the community. In this paper, we argue urban slums are ideal places to consider adaptation because they offer examples of more extreme social-ecological stress than one finds in more established communities - the kind we can anticipate more broadly in the face of climate change. A framework for identifying local adaptation processes is presented and applied to analyse the case of Mathare Valley Slums in Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated suburb, where residents are regularly exposed to flooding from heavy rainfall. Findings reveal that slums, often viewed as illegitimate, makeshift, and temporary settlements, are places experienced by many residents as permanent communities characterised by rapid environmental change. Processes of adaptation in Mathare have become institutionalised through time, as a new generation of people imagine themselves staying and (re)organise to achieve a higher level of functioning through various strategies to reduce risk. Innovative and revitalising adaptation occurs as residents shift from employing more generic and expected coping strategies, such as evacuating homes or economic diversification, to creating ""gated"" communities and savings schemes to maintain and improve the settlement, despite uncertain tenure. Both formal and informal institutions, such as youth groups, play an important role in governing such heterogeneous localities, incrementally upgrading the slum and providing critical public services. Long-term residents' increasing recognition of the permanence of the slum community and its stressful conditions appears to lead to more collective action toward adaptation pathways. However, this is in marked contrast to the dominant non-local perspective of Mathare's status as both impermanent and illegal, which prevails among government officials. As such, strategies are generally not incorporated into planned interventions. While progressive policies designed to reduce risk exist, they remain nascent in their establishment and fail to benefit slumdwellers. The case illustrates the need to incorporate the wealth of knowledge, techniques, and experience extant at the community level in the development of adaptation planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Autonomous adaptation; Climate change; Flooding; Mathare valley slums; Urban slums; Urbanisation,"Thorn J., Thornton T.F., Helfgott A.",10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.12.009
26,60.0,1994,Article,Reading landscape meanings: State constructions and lived experiences in Singapore's Chinatown,"The term 'landscape"" embodies multiple levels of meaning: it articulates the ideological intent of the powerful who plan or shape the landscape in particular ways and at the same time reflects the everyday meanings implicit in the daily routines of ordinary people associated with the landscape. Through an analysis of four themes constituting the landscape of Singapore's Chinatown, we unpack two different but interdependent versions of landscape reality: the construction of social meanings from the state's perspective and those derived from the lived experiences of Chinatown's inhabitants. In our first theme, we explore the multiplicity of meanings invested in Chinatown's housing landscape. For the state, urban renewal and public housing schemes in Chinatown represent the redrawing of landscapes along modernist lines informed by efficiency and rationality of land use, in tandem with the larger goals of nation-building. Among residents, however, the vision of modern living in everyday life was only a reality for a few; others experience the landscape in more contradictory ways. Second, in the landscape of community building, we show that state-initiated efforts at inculcating a sense of community have replaced the old spontaneous, interpersonal ties and the strength of organised vernacular associations. Inadvertently, these state strategies have in some ways actually been damaging and deleterious to community ties. In our third theme, we show how the state has, to a large extent, successfully rewritten the socially and physically polluted landscapes of Chinatown. Yet, there are examples of resistances where the state's vision of an unpolluted landscape has been punctured. Since the mid-1980s, a fourth imperative has emerged in the state's management of the Chinatown landscape in the form of attempts to conserve the landscape as a ""historic district"", a repository of the nation's tradition, history and culture. We show that there are different interpretations of the state's effort to revitalise Chinese culture in the conserved landscape and its attempt to cast Chinatown in the role of a ""common bond place"" for all Singaporeans.

Drawing principally on qualitative research findings from a study involving both adult and child researchers, our aim is to chart the diversities and commonalities of urban young people's mobility experiences in the everyday - how they use and experience the city - developing a comparative perspective across three urban study sites which links young people's mobility with the power relations that operate to shape their movements in individual locations. In particular, we consider how positive and negative images of young people's mobility play out in terms of the inter-generational frictions and negotiations generated by their mobility performances. We also reflect on the developmental implications, in terms of young people's access to services and income and their participation in the social networks and peer culture which may shape their life trajectories. Three themes are explored in detail: mobility as challenge, mobility as temptation and mobility control. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Children; Ghana; Inter-generational relations; Malawi; Mobility; South Africa; Transport; Urban; Young people,"Porter G., Hampshire K., Abane A., Robson E., Munthali A., Mashiri M., Tanle A.",10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.05.001

Since today all people are engaged in emerging collective experiments on matters as varied as climate, food, landscape, health, urban design, and technical communication as consumers, militants, and citizens, they can all be considered co-researchers. Co-researching has consequences for our understanding of nature and demands a renewed attention to ""multinaturalist"" politics.

29,52.0,2011,Book,Greater Portland: Urban life and landscape in the Pacific Northwest,"It has been called one of the nation’s most livable regions, ranked among the best managed cities in America, hailed as a top spot to work, and favored as a great place to do business, enjoy the arts, pursue outdoor recreation, and make one’s home. Indeed, years of cooperative urban planning between developers and those interested in ecology and habitability have transformed Portland from a provincial western city into an exemplary American metropolis. Its thriving downtown, its strong neighborhoods, and its pioneering efforts at local management have brought a steady procession of journalists, scholars, and civic leaders to investigate the “Portland style” that values dialogue and consensus, treats politics as a civic duty, and assumes that it is possible to work toward public good. Probing behind the press clippings, acclaimed urban historian Carl Abbott examines the character of contemporary Portland-its people, politics, and public life-and the region’s history and geography in order to discover how Portland has achieved its reputation as one of the most progressive and livable cities in the United States and to determine whether typical pressures of urban growth are pushing Portland back toward the national norm. In Greater Portland, Abbott argues that the city cannot be understood without reference to its place. Its rivers, hills, and broader regional setting have shaped the economy and the cityscape. Portlanders are Oregonians, Northwesteners, Cascadians; they value their city as much for where it is as for what it is, and this powerful sense of place nurtures a distinctive civic culture. Tracing the ways in which Portlanders have talked and thought about their city, Abbott reveals the tensions between their diverse visions of the future and plans for development. Most citizens of Portland desire a balance between continuity and change, one that supports urban progress but actively monitors its effects on the region’s expansive green space and on the community’s culture. This strong civic participation in city planning and politics is what gives greater Portland its unique character, a positive setting for class integration, neighborhood revitalization, and civic values. The result, Abbott confirms, is a region whose unique initiatives remain a model of American urban planning. © 2001 University of Pennsylvania Press. All rights reserved.",,Abbott C.,
30,49.0,2010,Article,Influence of hot arid climate on the use of outdoor urban spaces and thermal comfort: Do cultural and social backgrounds matter?,"Climate-sensitive open spaces within cities may have a positive effect on economic, social and environmental aspects of the urban environment. Improvement of microclimatic conditions in urban spaces can enable people to spend more time outdoors, with the potential to influence the social cohesion of a space and increase economic activity. The wider aim of this research is to develop a better understanding of the complex relationship between the microclimate and human behaviour in open public spaces in hot arid climates. Case studies are selected in two different parts of the world (Marrakech in North Africa and Phoenix, Arizona in the US) to represent a variety of users in a similar climatic context. This enables the authors to study the effects of socio-economic and cultural diversity on thermal comfort, behaviour and use of space. Field surveys include structured interviews with a standard questionnaire and observations of human activities, along with microclimatic monitoring, carried out during the summers and winters of 2008 and 2009. The analysis consists of: microclimatic influence on thermal sensation, preference and people attendance; effect of psychological adaptation on the subjective thermal evaluation of outdoor spaces; and investigation of socio-economic and socio-cultural impact on the behaviour of people in outdoor spaces. © 2010 Earthscan.",Hot climate; Microclimate; Outdoor thermal comfort; Socio-culture; Urban design,"Aljawabra F., Nikolopoulou M.",10.3763/inbi.2010.0046
31,48.0,2011,Article,Reclaiming the city: Waterfront development in Singapore,"In its quest to be a world city, many of Singapore's urban spaces have been subjected to constant redevelopment. Derelict waterfronts and ageing neighbourhoods have been given new life, enjoying their reincarnation as landscapes of economy and leisure. A prevalent theme in Singapore's transformation has been the reclamation of landscapes to cater to new users, activities and agendas. Adopting a case study of the Singapore River waterfront, this paper analyses three forms of urban reclamation. They include reclaiming functionality, aimed at infusing the waterfront with new land uses; reclaiming access, as a way of opening up the landscape to more people; and reclaiming the local, as a way to commemorate local cultures and histories. While government planners and private enterprise are intent on developing a world-class environment, Singaporeans and visitors respond to this urban vision in different ways with some praising the dynamism of worldly transformations and others criticising them as a prelude to a soulless city. While some degree of worldliness is essential in any redevelopment, a fine balance has to be sought between the excesses of global urbanism and the parochialism of vernacular concerns. © 2010 Urban Studies Journal Limited.",,"Chang T.C., Huang S.",10.1177/0042098010382677

35,41.0,2016,Book,Bike lanes are white lanes: Bicycle advocacy and urban planning,"The number of bicyclists is increasing in the United States, especially among the working class and people of color. In contrast to the demographics of bicyclists in the United States, advocacy for bicycling has focused mainly on the interests of white upwardly mobile bicyclists, leading to neighborhood conflicts and accusations of racist planning. In Bike Lanes Are White Lanes, scholar Melody L. Hoffmann argues that the bicycle has varied cultural meaning as a ""rolling signifier."" That is, the bicycle’s meaning changes in different spaces, with different people, and in different cultures. The rolling signification of the bicycle contributes to building community, influences gentrifying urban planning, and upholds systemic race and class barriers. In this study of three prominent U.S. cities-Milwaukee, Portland, and Minneapolis-Hoffmann examines how the burgeoning popularity of urban bicycling is trailed by systemic issues of racism, classism, and displacement. From a pro-cycling perspective, Bike Lanes Are White Lanes highlights many problematic aspects of urban bicycling culture and its advocacy as well as positive examples of people trying earnestly to bring their community together through bicycling. © 2016 by the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska.",,Hoffmann M.L.,
36,40.0,2018,Article,Assessing the sustainability of Spanish cities considering environmental and socio-economic indicators,"The conception of urban metabolism has considered the perspective of environmental sustainability in the framework of cities. In this context, cities can be regarded complex entities driven by material and energy flows that entail consumption of resources and production of waste materials in the pursuit of economic welfare and social progress. According to a sustainability perspective, environmental, social and economic indicators must also be integrated into urban planning processes. However, methodological advances regarding the definition and development of sustainable cities are required since a consensus of indicators, weighting and data management is still lacking. In this paper, a multi-criteria approach that combines three methodologies: Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been developed and applied to a sample of 26 representative Spanish cities with different characteristics (i.e., population, location, demands, economy, topography and culture). The combined approach allows identifying the non-sustainable cities considering an offset of indicators from the three pillars of sustainability. With this purpose, the mentioned items are implemented in a DEA model of efficiency, being the inefficient cities with an efficiency score lower than 100% defined as non-sustainable ones. Finally, this multi-criteria method allows setting the target values for the assessed indicators (benchmarked values), which become objectives for the non-sustainable cities to evolve toward a more sustainable performance. The outcomes from the analysis have identified six cities that ranked worse, with efficiency scores ranging from 57.9% to 85.8%. According to the targets of socio-economic indicators, attention should be paid to AROPE rate (people at risk of poverty and social exclusion), unemployment rate and number of crimes, meanwhile lower levels of electricity consumption, municipal solid waste and on-site greenhouse gases emissions are desirable from an environmental perspective. These outcomes are of potential interest for politicians, governments and inhabitants to aid in the identification of the metabolic flows and social/economic indicators to be optimized in search of sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Data envelopment analysis; Life cycle assessment; Material flow analysis; Multi-criteria tool; Urban metabolism,"Gonzalez-Garcia S., Manteiga R., Moreira M.T., Feijoo G.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.01.056
37,39.0,2020,Article,Development and implementation of Mobility-as-a-Service – A qualitative study of barriers and enabling factors,"Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has been argued as part of the solution to prevalent transport problems. However, progress from pilots to large-scale implementation has hitherto been slow. The aim of the research reported in this paper was to empirically and in-depth investigate how, and to what extent, different factors affect the development and implementation of MaaS. A framework was developed, with a basis in institutional theory and the postulation that formal as well informal factors on different analytical levels (macro, meso and micro) must be considered. The research was organised as a multiple case study in Finland and Sweden and a qualitative approach was chosen for data collection and analysis. A number of factors with a claimed impact on the development and implementation of MaaS was revealed. At the macro level, these factors included legislation concerning transport, innovation and public administration, and the presence (or not) of a shared vision for MaaS. At the meso level, (the lack of) appropriate business models, cultures of collaboration, and assumed roles and responsibilities within the MaaS ecosystem were identified as significant factors. At the micro level, people's attitudes and habits were recognised as important factors to be considered. However, how the ‘S’ in MaaS fits (or not) the transport needs of the individual/household appears to play a more important role in adoption or rejection of MaaS than what has often been acknowledged in previous papers on MaaS. The findings presented in this paper provide several implications for public and private sector actors. Law-making authorities can facilitate MaaS developments by adjusting relevant regulations and policies such as transport-related subsidies, taxation policies and the definition of public transport. Regional and local authorities could additionally contribute to creating conducive conditions for MaaS by, for example, planning urban designs and transport infrastructures to support service-based travelling. Moreover, private actors have key roles to play in future MaaS developments, as both public and private transport services are needed if MaaS is to become a viable alternative to privately owned cars. Thus, the advance of MaaS business models that benefit all involved actors is vital for the prosperity of the emerging MaaS ecosystem. © 2019 The Authors",Barriers; Enablers; Formal institutions; Informal institutions; MaaS; Mobility-as-a-Service,"Karlsson I.C.M., Mukhtar-Landgren D., Smith G., Koglin T., Kronsell A., Lund E., Sarasini S., Sochor J.",10.1016/j.tra.2019.09.028
38,38.0,2015,Article,"Slum upgrading and inclusive municipal governance in Harare, Zimbabwe: New perspectives for the urban poor","The story of the urban poor in Harare and Zimbabwean cities in general is a story of evictions, fear and misery. In May 2005, at the behest of the Government of Zimbabwe the infamous Operation Restore Order, a house demolition campaign left more than 700 thousand people homeless. Nearly a decade later, there are increased opportunities for improvement and change in the lives of the urban poor in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital city. The purpose of the paper is to present how the Harare Slum Upgrading Programme is creating and strengthening municipal and community partnerships to tackle city challenges in an inclusive manner. This research indicates the housing struggles of the urban poor and the emerging City-community engagement in urban services provision (water, sanitation, tenure security and roads) and changing municipal attitudes towards the urban poor. In particular, the article presents participatory urban planning and development, slum upgrading institutional structure, profiling and enumeration, and slum upgrading impacts (resilience of the urban poor, living in slums without fear, expansive pool of beneficiaries, review of planning regulations and land ownership) as major issues promoting inclusive municipal governance. Inclusivity is implemented through incremental development, which is allowing people to settle on land first and access municipal services gradually over time. Two main factors explain such positive steps towards inclusive governance in Harare. First are indications of gradual institutional change in which the City of Harare's governance culture is changing through 'opening up' and embracing the urban poor. Second, over the years, the urban poor have built a strong and vibrant alliance which is acting as a medium of participation in City governance. The paper concludes that slum upgrading sustainability at city-wide level requires active City participation and institutionalisation as opposed to a project based approach. Lastly, addressing concerns of the urban poor is susceptible to political contestations, requiring strong impartiality to counter such forces. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Citizen participation; Gradual institutional change; Harare; Housing; Inclusive municipal governance; Slum upgrading; Urban poor; Urban services; Zimbabwe,Muchadenyika D.,10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.03.003

Urban green spaces have particular value because they offer the benefits of cultural services to those living in urban areas. This study analyzed perceptions of cultural ecosystem services in the urban context of Gwacheon, Republic of Korea. We analyzed the cultural services provided by green space by surveying 240 residents of Gwacheon about which green spaces they frequently visit and what their major activities are in these green spaces, in order to find out how green spaces are utilized by urban residents. Since forests and large parks in Gwacheon are easily accessible from downtown areas because of the city structure, they play major roles in providing cultural ecosystem services. This study suggests that people find diverse cultural value in their everyday surroundings, not just in spaces with excellent ecosystems.

44,32.0,2004,Article,On the waterfront: Globalization and urbanization in singapore,"Although many cities aspire to ""global-city status,"" few have been as explicit as Singapore in its quest to create urban landscapes to project its global aspirations. This paper presents the case of the Singapore River development zone as a ""hyper-symbol"" of Singapore's global urbanism. By creating a world-class riverfront not unlike the acclaimed waterfronts of London, Sydney, or San Francisco, Singapore's urban planners hope to project the city as a venue worthy of world-class tourism and leisure activities, an important node in international circuits of capital, and a vibrant city for both foreign visitors and local residents. Our paper, however, also argues that local forces and influences play a significant role in the waterfront's development. The Singapore River landscape is the negotiated outcome of both globalism and localism—a dialectical landscape formed by dominant global influences on the one hand, and emerging local processes on the other. Fieldwork comprising a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews, and on-site observations provide evidence of such global-local interactions. The paper contends that the challenges at the river are symptomatic of the broader Singapore experience as the city-state grapples with issues of national identity, local empowerment, and community rights in the midst of a global convergence of tourists, capital, people, and cultures. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Chang T.C., Huang S., Savage V.R.",10.2747/0272-3638.25.5.413
45,30.0,2013,Book,"The middle class in neoliberal China: Governing risk, life-building, and themed spaces","Since the late 1970s, China's move towards neoliberalism has made it not only one of the world's fastest growing economies, but also one of the most polarised states. This economic, social and political transformation has led to the emergence of a new Chinese middle class, and understanding the development and the role of this new social group is crucial to understanding contemporary Chinese society. Investigating the new politics of the middle class in China, this book addresses three major questions. First, how does the Chinese state deal with problems of national sovereignty and political representation to create the middle class both as a legitimate category of the people and as an ideal norm of citizenship? Second, how does the recognition of the middle class norm take place in the practice of everyday life? Finally, what kind of risks does the politics of the middle class generate not only for middle class subjects but also for the disenfranchised? In answering these questions, this book examines a set of practices, bodies of knowledge, measures, and institutions that aim to manage, govern, control, and orient the behaviours, gestures, and thoughts of Chinese citizens. This investigation contributes not only to the understanding of the Chinese middle class society but also to the scholarly debate over the relationship between governmental apparatuses, subjectification, and life-building. Drawing on ethnographic information, historical archives, and the media, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars working in the fields of Chinese studies, Chinese politics, ethnic studies and urban studies, as well as those interested in culture, society, class and welfare. © 2013 Hai Ren.

After the questionnaires were completed, noise measurements were made in each area. Community responses were compared on the basis of the dose-response relationships. There were no systematic differences between community responses in Sapporo and Kumamoto, which have the same culture. People living in detached houses in Gothenburg were more annoyed by the same road traffic noise than the people living in Japanese cities. There were no systematic differences among the three cities with regard to activity disturbances indoors, but significant disturbance of activities and resting in gardens or on balconies was noted in Gothenburg. The difference in activity disturbance was due to the differences between lifestyles in the two countries.

49,27.0,1998,Article,Intellectual of empire: Eric Dutton and hegemony in British Africa,"This essay examines the career of Eric Dutton in five British African colonies from 1919 to 1952, with case studies of his work in Lusaka and Zanzibar. In analyzing Dutton's career, I use a Gramscian conception of the role of intellectuals in creating colonial hegemony, against the backdrop of recent research on the relationship of geography to colonial discourse. Dutton worked and corresponded with key players in Britain's African empire. He was a major force behind early urban-planning programs in East and Central Africa and author of four geographical books. Permanently disabled by war wounds, he was also permanently infatuated with the moral rightness of British imperial culture. A concern for geography's professional relationship with, and the geographical legacy of, colonialism has emerged in recent scholarship on Africa, largely through studies of travel writing, fiction, and nineteenth- or early twentieth-century exploration geography. Later scholar-officials like Dutton sought to apply their knowledge to the shaping of spaces to serve the Empire's direct and immediate needs in Africa, even while trying to win the hearts and minds of its subject peoples. Around Timothy Mitchell's (1988) concept of ""enframing,"" I build an analysis of the spatial projects with which Dutton is most associated and show how Lusaka and Zanzibar were enframed by his plans. Through his publications and correspondences, as well as his seemingly omnipresent service, Dutton has an important legacy that has neither been articulated nor analyzed, one which points to the importance of contextualized biography for analyses of colonial discourse. I argue here for seeing Dutton as an intellectual in the service of colonial hegemony and its enframing spatial discourse, although the character of his agency exemplifies why that attempted hegemony failed.",Africa; Colonialism; Cultural hegemony,Myers G.A.,10.1111/1467-8306.00082
50,27.0,1989,Article,"Space, culture and urban design in late modernism and after","Among the questions underlying recent debates about the architecture of the city, two are perhaps more fundamental. The first concerns the legitimacy of architectural practice: can we be assertive about how we should design our cities without seeking to enforce social assumptions which are ultimately authoritarian? The second concerns architectural theory itself: can we be specific about what architecture does without being reductive about what society is? This article identifies and criticizes two kinds of recent responses to these questions: the first is to defend an architecture of localism and containment in some new and some old ways; the second is to retreat into relativism, sometimes supported by the assertion that architecture is of limited consequence because society is increasingly independent of space. The article defends the view that we can and must be assertive about the architecture of cities in global rather than local terms. The experience of genuinely urban environments is about meeting, though not necessarily interacting with, other people, mostly unknown, who can be of recognizably different class, status, race or ethnic origin; it is also about exploring the strange, and becoming aware of, though not necessarily participating in, other ways of life. -from Author",,Peponis J.,
51,26.0,2015,Article,"Wildfire risk, biodiversity and peri-urban planning in the Mt Lofty Ranges, South Australia","Major fires on the periphery of Australian cities are reframing perceptions of what constitutes effective landscape planning and vegetation management. The emerging governance challenge to simultaneously mitigate wildfire risk and support improved conservation practices is reviewed in the context of pre-colonial and modern cultures within the peri-urban Mediterranean climatic region of South Australia's Mt Lofty Ranges. The analysis suggests that anthropogenic burning of landscape has been a vital historical component of risk management. During the early modern era however, improved capacities to manage wildfire risk led to complacency in light of the hazard, which in turn has led to urbanization that has not sufficiently accounted for the levels of risk. A planning conflict is emerging within the wooded uplands as there is renewed interest in wildfire risk, which is reflected in new state policies providing greater allowances for land owners to clear vegetation around dwellings. Although attempts have been made to constrain urban growth around the city of Adelaide, recent workshops with key environmental management stakeholders suggest that urbanization continues within the Mt Lofty Ranges in areas that are both highly vulnerable to fire and of great importance for biodiversity conservation, such that planning is not reflecting the cultures of risk or biodiversity value. For such risks and values to be taken into account within reflexive systems of governance, the narratives on opportunities for adaptation generated by the people who facilitate vegetation management must be accommodated into deliberations on policy. The identification and planning of particularly vulnerable and valuable spaces within the broader landscape and cultural contexts of risk and value would enable complex, targeted responses to environmental hazards, conservation and development needs in the peri-urban uplands. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Biodiversity conservation; Peri-urban; Planning; Reflexivity; Risk; South Australia; Urban development; Wildfire,"Bardsley D.K., Weber D., Robinson G.M., Moskwa E., Bardsley A.M.",10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.06.012
52,26.0,2008,Article,Imagining Portland's urban growth boundary: Planning regulation as cultural icon,"Problem: In the 30 years since its creation, has Portland, Oregon's, urban growth boundary (UGB) become something more than a regulation? Spirited debate about its impacts on land uses and values has inspired vivid descriptions by both supporters and critics and spurred the imagination of artists and creative writers. Purpose: The UGB has become a symbol, metaphor, and touchstone, as people read complex meanings into it that go beyond its simple legal function. This article looks at the UGB as a cultural icon. It explores the increasingly complex ways in which people have tried to describe, understand, and interpret the UGB as part of the regional landscape as well as the regulatory system. It examines metaphorical descriptions of the UGB as well as the growing body of depictions in nature writing, poetry, novels, photography, performance art, songs, and other exercises of the artistic imagination. Methods: We review how supporters and critics of the UGB have described it and how artists have depicted it in various media.Results and conclusions: Although many planning projects have become icons, few planning regulations have done so. Artistic interpretations have familiarized and humanized the UGB and embedded it in the consciousness of everyday life. Artists thus make the invisible more visible or legible. Acting as a viewfinder, the UGB offers an opportunity for conversation and interpretation from multiple perspectives.

53,25.0,2019,Article,Preferences and emotion perceptions of ornamental plant species for green space designing among urban park users in Iran,"The main objective of the present study was to explore preferences and eumotion perceptions of people in Rasht and Ardabil (Iran) to some ornamental plants in order to help designing appropriate urban green landscapes. The study surveyed urban park users in the two cities in 2017 to identify and compare the most important factors underpinning the viability of public open spaces from the perspective of users (mental aspect) and the extent to which these mental factors match the visual features of the selected spaces (visual aspect). A random sample of 232 individuals was taken from students in Ardabil (119 persons) and Rasht (113 persons). A considerable part of the participants (37.2%) reported a feeling of tranquility when they saw flowers, while 28.8% of the participants reported a feeling of love. Flower-bearing plant species were more appealing to the participants than leafy ornamental plants. Red was the most preferred flower color (52.1%) followed by violet (18.6%) and orange (11.4%) among the ornamental species commonly used in the design of green spaces, while tulip (Tulipa gesneriana) (29%), rose (Rosa hybrida) (25%), and Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) (19%) were in the first top ranks of preferences, respectively. Coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides) and garden croton (Codiaeum variegatum) were also reported among preferred species. The results support the assumption of similarity in preferences and requirements of citizens of large cities and despite great diversity in geography, culture, and ethics, people in large cities exhibit similar emotion perceptions. The study findings are expected to support public authorities and urban planners to effectively design and manage urban green spaces to meet users’ needs. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Green space; Public perception; Sense of place; Urban landscape,"Rahnema S., Sedaghathoor S., Allahyari M.S., Damalas C.A., Bilali H.E.",10.1016/j.ufug.2018.12.007
55,24.0,2016,Article,Urban planning in Qatar: strategies and vision for the development of transit villages in Doha,"Doha, the capital city of the State of Qatar, has went through a fast growth in its economy and transformation of its built environment. Currently, major urban public transit systems are under construction. This paper looks at Souq Waqif station and its surrounding neighbourhood as one of the new transit hubs of Qatar. The district is located in the core of Doha and plays a significant role in the social, economic and particularly culture, as a way of life, of the people in Qatar. Within the context of Doha, there is an urge to implement transit villages, also defined as transit-oriented developments (TODs), in most of the existing centres along the rail network. A TOD is a mixed use commercial and residential area designed to maximise access to public transport and to encourage transit ridership. Therefore, it is critical to understand the benefits and impacts that TODs would invite in this context before investing large funds in developing them. The research empirically investigates the level at which transit villages can be implemented and also formed within the built environment of Doha. It is argued that this strategy and vision would encourage sustainable development by supporting better transport integration and land use. The aim is to assess and promote sustainable developments integration in the city of Doha through controlling increasing traffic and planning for transit villages. In order to develop a strategy for intervention, the existing TOD case study of Yeerongpilly in Australia was analysed, followed by the exploration of the conditions of the existing Souq Waqif area. The assessment of the Souq Waqif allowed judgments of the existing development to be made, which in turn leads to the draft of potential recommendations and suggestions for the formation and implementation of transit villages in Doha. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",built environment; Doha Metro; TODs; urban fabric,"Zaina S., Zaina S., Furlan R.",10.1080/07293682.2016.1259245
56,24.0,2015,Article,'China's leading historical and cultural city': Branding Dali City through public-private partnerships in Bai architecture revitalization,"Competing with other Chinese cities for investment and tourism, various governmental bodies with jurisdiction in Dali City have begun to make use of local historical and cultural assets in order to brand the city. This paper aims to reveal how partnerships between the public and private sectors in heritage management have functioned as an approach to city branding, and how local people perceive and are influenced by these partnerships. Applying perspectives from the scholarly literature on city branding and public-private partnerships, this paper examines two cases in Dali City - Zhang's Garden and the Linden Center - to detail how local government and elite entrepreneurs have partnernered in support of Bai architecture revitalization with tourism in mind. This paper also considers opinions from the local general public regarding these partnerships, and investigates the complex relationships among local government, elite entrepreneurs, and the public. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Bai culture; China; City branding; Dali City; Heritage revitalization; Public-private partnership,Zhao Y.,10.1016/j.cities.2015.07.009
57,24.0,2011,Article,Traditional architectural forms in market oriented Chinese cities: Place for localities or symbol of culture?,"China provides a unique social-economic and political context for urban conservation and regeneration within the current trend of modernisation and globalisation. This paper investigates 4 urban regeneration projects conducted in four most internationalised historical Chinese cities from 1989 to 2005, in order to understand how traditional architectural elements are manipulated in these projects. It also examines the roles local governments, developers, designers and local residents played in these projects in the intensification process of the market oriented economy over time. The paper argues that socio-cultural sustainable regeneration of historical urban environments must make places for local people, rather than preserve certain traditional forms as cultural symbols. Tradition must evolve by the collective and traditional forms must be widely used in architectural and urban design with community involvement, in order to achieve real cultural identity and social cohesion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Market oriented economy; Symbol of culture; Tradition; Urban regeneration,Chen F.,10.1016/j.habitatint.2010.11.012

Ecological sustainability requires people's understanding of the role of both diversity and connectivity of riparian areas.

60,22.0,2020,Article,Uncovering inconspicuous places using social media check-ins and street view images,"There is a Chinese proverb, “if your wine tastes really good, you do not need to worry about the location of your bar (酒香不怕巷子深)”, which implies that the popular places for local residents are sometimes hidden behind an unassuming door or on unexpected streets. Discovering these unassuming places (e.g. restaurants) of a city will benefit the understanding of local culture and help to build livable neighborhoods. Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing. These places are potential recreational areas for all groups of people and could be improved regarding urban design and planning to make these public infrastructures more attractive. This work demonstrates how multi-source big geo-data can be combined to build comprehensive place-based representations for different groups of people. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Place semantics; Residents and visitors; Social media check-ins; Social sensing; Street view images,"Zhang F., Zu J., Hu M., Zhu D., Kang Y., Gao S., Zhang Y., Huang Z.",10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101478

These people are too many to mention by name, but I owe all of them a debt of gratitude. While writing this book I was very fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of colleagues, particularly Lucy Horan and Ruth Craggs, as well as the support and encouragement of my other colleagues at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Finally, a huge thank you to John, Muireann and Aoife for absolutely everything.IntroductionIn 1991, Getz wrote that festivals and holiday events represented nouveau, alternative tourism (cited in Lee et al., 2008). How times have changed! Such an assertion is simply unimaginable today when, more than 20 years later, finding a city or town without at least one annual festival or planned event would be quite a challenge. Does this constitute progress? How do festivals and events contribute to contemporary society? What has the remarkable rise in festivals and events meant for the development of tourism destinations; for the development of economies, be they local, national or international? These and many other questions preoccupy what is now an extremely large, international community of scholars from a range of disciplines who adopt a variety of research approaches to study the complex and profoundly important communal celebrations at the heart of the diverse festivals and events treated in this volume.While it is difficult to calculate the size of festival and event activity, academic, policy and industry commentators everywhere concur that its recent growth across the world in terms of numbers, diversity and popularity has been enormous (Getz, 1991; Finkel, 2009; Thrane, 2002). In the USA it is estimated that there were 10,000 festivals per year, attracting over 31 million visitors by the mid-1990s (Janiskee, 1996; TIA, 2004). In Australia, the government notes that festivals have become ubiquitous, with hundreds being held every year (Australian Government, 2012). In Europe, the growth has been similarly dramatic. According to the International Festival and Event Association (IFEA), the special events industry is estimated to comprise between 4 and 5 million regularly occurring events (Wood, 2012). This significant growth in the practice of festivals and events brought a parallel increase in the emergence and development of the festival and event management profession. It soon also brought a rise in academic interest: closely allied to the development of tourism studies, academics began to take an interest in charting developments in the sector and the literature has burgeoned over the last 20 years. Much of the research is published in tourism studies and specific event-oriented journals, but it also finds expression in a wide range of journals dedicated to management and marketing, urban and place studies, arts and cultural policy, as well as many social sciences-oriented journals. In the majority of cases, festivals and special events are presented as broadly positive phenomena. Throughout the literature, opening paragraphs emphasise the important roles they play in advancing local and regional economies, branding places, attracting visitors, extending the tourism season and fostering community spirit. Yet, festivals and special events, the subject matter at the heart of this book represent a very substantial, complex and dynamic set of activities that can be both deeply rooted and rapidly changing in countries throughout the world. In academia, they are studied from diverse management, social sciences and humanities perspectives. As such, interpretations of their impact and contribution to contemporary economies and societies as well as approaches to valuing, managing and shaping appropriate policies for their advancement are multiple and at times conflicting.The literature in the field is now enormous and growing all the time. Increasing familiarity with the literature brings an increasing awareness of the unevenness of knowledge, the fractures between academic disciplines and the continuous emergence of new sub-fields. The literature on the Olympic Games, for example, is now in and of itself very substantial, yet the extent to which knowledge generated on this particular event translates across into the study of other events that differ by scale and type is very unclear. Getz and Andersson (2010) explained that festival tourism has been studied by many researchers from many perspectives: impact (of varying types), place marketing, travel patterns, displacement effects, motivation, market segmentation, quality and satisfaction, regional development, relationship to urban renewal and development, and links to culture and community. However, this sector is nothing if not dynamic and while knowledge gaps are closing in some areas, they continue to open up elsewhere all the time. This book tries to take cognisance of this dynamism in including concepts that would seem very important in terms of future development. The concept of ‘ risk management', so important from an applied perspective, and that of ‘ emerging economies', so important from a geographical perspective, are two examples of this.This volume is tasked with introducing, defining and reviewing the current state of knowledge of the key concepts in the contemporary study of festivals and events. While this involves reviewing literature that is either part of, or closely associated with, tourism studies, in reality, it is a multi-disciplinary task that draws on a wide breadth of discipline areas. It is well recognised that festivals and special events are important from community, social, cultural, political and economic perspectives. Despite the growth and popularity of festivals and special events, researchers were initially slow in directing research beyond economic impacts and motivations (Gursoy et al., 2004). However, this imbalance is now being corrected. The recent evolution of the academic study of festivals and events cannot be understood in isolation from the simultaneous evolution of the academic study of tourism. As themes of enquiry have emerged and developed within tourism studies, they virtually always evolve into a new theme of enquiry within festival and event studies. This link between the two areas of study is very strong, with tourism studies the primary field of enquiry and festivals and events a large and distinct sub-field within.The task of advancing knowledge about the meanings, practices and policies associated with festivals and events remains ongoing. As this volume will show, the understanding of core concepts remains uneven, and our knowledge of certain dimensions of festival and event activity far exceeds that of others. Some of the extant gaps are recent, emerging only when contemporary political and societal debates begin to highlight particular concerns. The concept of innovation is a case in point: questions as to the role that the festival and event sector plays in promoting, adopting and managing innovation are now coming to the fore in the literature. Others, such as the sustainability of the sector's activities have been an issue for longer. Most recently of all, the question as to how festival and event activities are affected by global recession has begun to be investigated, in response to the harsh realities negatively affecting the health of the sector in very recent times. The 35 concepts that are discussed in this volume are laid out in alphabetical order. © Bernadette Quinn 2013.",,Quinn B.,10.4135/9781473914742
62,22.0,2008,Article,Property rights and landscape planning in the intermountain west: The Teton Valley case,"Non-participation in landscape planning presents a formidable challenge to sustainable development. We hypothesize that even when people hold negative attitudes toward unplanned development, natural property rights values (favorable evaluations of property as an inviolable and pre-political right) prevent them from acting on their concerns. We chose an intermountain west community as a case study to evaluate our hypothesis regarding natural property rights values. All groups were equally and strongly opposed to continuation of rapid unplanned growth, but those with natural property rights values were also adamantly opposed to land use planning. We used a multiple logistic regression model to evaluate the relationship between support for landscape planning and a natural property rights values. An overall significance test of the regression equation indicated the independent variables were significantly predictive of the dependent variable (χ2 128, 8 d.f., p &lt; 0.001) and had high (88.7%) predictive capacity. Natural property rights value was the most important predictor variable, but income was also significant. Sustainable landscape planning requires uncoupling property rights from inviolable and pre-political natural rights. Our results suggest a conversation focused on themes associated with loss of local culture, hypocrisy of building practices, and market control over development could facilitate the aforementioned uncoupling and development planning that promotes both security for land owners and public welfare. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These 'stonewall' trees denoting synergy between nature (trees) and culture (masonry) are worth preserving. This study aims to identify factors influencing public attitude toward this important but threatened natural-cum-cultural asset in a compact city milieu. Evidence is solicited from a face-to-face questionnaire survey involving 800 citizens of Hong Kong. Results indicate that Hong Kong people generally appreciate the existence of stonewall trees. Younger adults harbored doubts about their value, whereas the older ones were more sympathetic. Local residents of the suburbs that host the majority of stonewall trees registered stronger commitment than non-local residents. Community attachment had positive effects across both resident groups, but length of tenure was not a key factor. This suggests that affinity for stonewall trees is a function of the affective bonding between people and the community where they live. Deep engagement with the local community elevated the desire for preserving the walls and associated trees. The findings are important for understanding public perception and enlisting support from the larger society for preserving the urban asset against mounting pressures for urban development and renewal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Compact city; Place attachment; Public perception; Stone-retaining walls; Urban nature conservation; Urban trees,"Lo A.Y., Jim C.Y.",10.1016/j.cities.2014.09.006
65,21.0,2009,Article,"Factors affecting compliance with residential standards in the city of Old Salt, Jordan","The aim of this paper is to examine the factors which impact on the extent to which urban housing complies with residential standards in the city of Old Salt based in Jordan. The research found that the level of compliance with residential standards is quite low and can vary from one standard to another and from one house to another due to differences in the socio-economic characteristics among people. The findings of multiple regression analysis reveal that there is a good level of public awareness of residential standards, but this does not result in complete compliance with residential standards. Factors, such as household income per month, household size, finance facilities, municipal administration culture, monitoring, enforcement and the uncertainty of residential standards have a significant impact on the extent of compliance with planning standards. Suggestions for improved urban planning practices which address these issues are summarised in the paper and include reassessed current residential standards through comprehensive legal frameworks, linking residential standards with urban design approaches, changing planning practices, developing information systems to produce effective monitoring systems of construction processes and enforcement mechanisms, the development of local staff including planners, designers and environmental engineers, supported partnerships between private and public sectors, and the use of participatory planning and citizen involvement.

67,20.0,2010,Book,Cities and design,"Cities, initially a product of the manufacturing era, have been thoroughly remade in the image of consumer society. Competitive spending among affluent households has intensified the importance of style and design at every scale and design professions have grown in size and importance, reflecting distinctive geographies and locating disproportionately in cities most intimately connected with global systems of key business services. Meanwhile, many observers still believe good design can make positive contributions to people's lives. ities and Design explores the complex relationships between design and urban environments. It traces the intellectual roots of urban design, presents a critical appraisal of the imprint and effectiveness of design professions in shaping urban environments, examines the role of design in the material culture of contemporary cities, and explores the complex linkages among designers, producers and distributors in contemporary cities, for example: fashion and graphic design in New York; architecture, fashion and publishing in London; furniture, industrial design, interior design and fashion in Milan; haute couture in Paris and so on. This book offers a distinctive social science perspective on the economic and cultural context of design in contemporary cities, presenting cities themselves as settings for design, design services and the 'affect' associated with design. © 2011 Paul L.

68,20.0,2009,Article,An imaginable community: The material culture of nation-building in early republican Turkey,"This paper examines the spatial strategies used to achieve national integration in the formative years (1923-45) of the Turkish Republic. During this critical period, despite a severe shortage of human and material resources, Turkey's leaders undertook ambitious infrastructural projects, including the construction of roads, railroads, bridges, institutional buildings, and the implementation of uniform urban plans, which were meant to transform the face of the country. These projects generated webs of uniform and centralized services, which enabled the state to assume a more active role in shaping the daily life of its citizens. Crucially, they also forged a standard recognizable material culture throughout Turkey. I argue that this extensive tangible scaffolding of public works, which introduced new types of spaces and practices, reworked the rhythms and routines of daily life, and created new networks of accessibility across the country, was instrumental for cultivating people's ability to relate the local with a larger national geography, thus rendering the nation an imaginable community. © 2009 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",,Kezer Z.,10.1068/d10907

In this paper, the author uses first hand information to chart the development and actual implementation of urban planning in the PRC using the national capital, Beijing, as an example. The study finds that the concepts, standards and methods used in the USSR had greatly influenced urban planning in Beijing between 1949 and 1991. However, there were also locally derived influences involved - Confucianism and Maoism. After 1978, market forces as well as contemporary Western planning ideas and methodologies started to have an effect on the planning of Beijing.

71,19.0,2017,Book,The Russian empire 1450-1801,"Being an empire is inseparable from modern Russian identity and historical experience: the Russian empire was founded in the early modern era and endures in large part today. The Russian Empire 1450-1801 surveys how Russia’s many subject areas were conquered and how the empire was governed. It considers the Russian empire a “Eurasian empire,” characterized by a “politics of difference”: the rulers and their elites at the center defined the state’s needs minimally (control over defense, taxation and mobilization of resources, criminal law) and otherwise tolerated local religions, languages, cultures, elites, and institutions. The center related to communities and religions vertically, according each a modicum of rights and autonomies but not allowing “horizontal” connections across social, ethnic, confessional, or other groups potentially with common interest. This book gives detailed attention to the major ethnic and religious groups as it surveys strategies of governance-centralized bureaucracy, military reform, judicial system, tolerance of difference. It pays particular attention to the dissemination of a supranational ideology of political legitimacy in a variety of media, particularly symbolic, such as public ritual, painting, architecture, and urban planning. Beginning with foundational features, such as geography, climate, demography, and geopolitical situation, the book explores the empire’s primarily agrarian economy, serfdom, towns and trade, religions, nobility, and high culture. It tracks the emergence of an “Imperial nobility” and a national self-consciousness that was, by the end of the eighteenth century, distinctly imperial, embracing the diversity of the empire’s many peoples and cultures. © Nancy Shields Kollmann 2017.",Architecture; Belarus; Crimea; Dynasty; Empire; Ethnic groups; Eurasia; Politics of difference; Siberia; Ukraine,Kollmann N.S.,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199280513.001.0001
72,19.0,2014,Book,Blue urbanism: Exploring connections between cities and oceans,"What would it mean to live in cities designed to foster feelings of connectedness to the ocean? As coastal cities begin planning for climate change and rising sea levels, author Timothy Beatley sees opportunities for rethinking the relationship between urban development and the ocean. Modern society is more dependent upon ocean resources than people are commonly aware of, from oil and gas extraction to wind energy, to the vast amounts of fish harvested globally, to medicinal compounds derived from sea creatures, and more. In Blue Urbanism, Beatley argues that, given all we've gained from the sea, city policies, plans, and daily urban life should acknowledge and support a healthy ocean environment. The book explores issues ranging from urban design and land use, to resource extraction and renewable energy, to educating urbanites about the wonders of marine life. Beatley looks at how emerging practices like ""community supported fisheries"" and aquaponics can provide a sustainable alternative to industrial fishing practices.Other chapters delve into incentives for increasing use of wind and tidal energy as renewable options to oil and gas extraction that damages ocean life, and how the shipping industry is becoming more ""green."" Additionally, urban citizens, he explains, have many opportunities to interact meaningfully with the ocean, from beach cleanups to helping scientists gather data. Ultimately, he explains that we must create a culture of ""ocean literacy"" using a variety of approaches, from building design and art installations that draw inspiration from marine forms, to encouraging citizen volunteerism related to oceans, to city-sponsored research, and support for new laws that protect marine health. Equal parts inspiration and practical advice for urban planners, ocean activists, and policymakers, Blue Urbanism offers a comprehensive look at the challenges and great potential for urban areas to integrate ocean health into their policy and planning goals. © 2014 Timothy Beatley.

73,19.0,2004,Article,Toronto and Vancouver bound: The location choice of new Canadian immigrants,"Ethnic clustering plays an important role in the location choice of new immigrants to Canada. A concentration of people in the same geographic area who are of similar ethnic background, culture and language can be an important source of financial and personal support, information and guidance, and social mores. Evidence is found that, after controlling for a range of other observable and unobservable factors important to the location decision, the concentration of people of a particular ethnic group in a particular area has a significant effect on the chance that new immigrants of the same ethnic group will choose to live there. The size of the effect, however, depends on the personal characteristics of immigrants. The attraction of ethnic concentrations of immigrants is significantly smaller for new immigrants with a university degree and for those who normally speak English at home. Characteristics of the local ethnic community related to education and language profiles are also significant determinants of location choice. © 2004 by the Institute of Urban Studies All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Immigrants; Mobility; Neighborhood effects,McDonald J.T.,
74,18.0,2019,Article,Yanama budyari gumada: reframing the urban to care as Darug Country in western Sydney,"In non-urban places of Australia, caring-as-Country frames natural resource management (NRM) as a practice of reciprocal, more-than-human care-giving (S. Suchet-Pearson, S. Wright, K. Lloyd, and L. Burarrwanga. 2013. ‘Caring as Country: towards and ontology of co-becoming in natural resource management.’ Asia Pacific Viewpoint 54 (2): 185–197). Caring-as-Country is an idea that encapsulates the entangled, reciprocal relationships that people have with, and as part of, agentic more-than-human worlds. In more urbanised places, however, practices of caring-as-Country are often unrecognised, undervalued and undocumented. In this paper we make explicit practices of caring, healing and rejuvenation at Yellomundee Regional Park, Darug Country in western Sydney. Our discussion of care, entanglement and reciprocity at Yellomundee focuses on two specific activities that embody caring-as-Country: the return of cultural burns and sustained presence on Country in the form of Darug-led culture camps. The Darug principle of yanama budyari gumada, to ‘walk with good spirit’, embodies and invites new ways of thinking and practising intercultural caring-as-Country in heavily colonised, urban places like Yellomundee. As we document the practices arising from this invitation, we consider its far-reaching implications for NRM and planning, and we expand on the importance of geographies of care for unceded urban places. © 2019, © 2019 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.",caring-as-Country; Darug Country; Indigenous; more-than-human; National Parks and Wildlife Service; natural resource management; Yellomundee Regional Park,"Ngurra D., Dadd L., Glass P., Scott R., Graham M., Judge S., Hodge P., Suchet-Pearson S.",10.1080/00049182.2019.1601150
75,18.0,2015,Book,"Vilnius between nations, 1795-2000","The inhabitants of Vilnius, the present-day capital of Lithuania, have spoken various languages and professed different religions while living together in relative harmony over the years. The city has played a significant role in the history and development of at least three separate cultures-Polish, Lithuanian, and Jewish-and until very recently, no single cultural-linguistic group composed the clear majority of its population. Vilnius between Nations, 1795-2000 is the first study to undertake a balanced assessment of this particularly diverse city. Theodore Weeks examines Vilnius as a physical entity where people lived, worked, and died; as the object of rhetorical struggles between disparate cultures; and as a space where the state attempted to legitimize a specific version of cultural politics through street names, monuments, and urban planning. In investigating these aspects, Weeks avoids promoting any one national narrative of the history of the city, while acknowledging the importance of national cultures and their opposing myths of the city’s identity. The story of Vilnius as a multicultural city and the negotiations that allowed several national groups to inhabit a single urban space can provide lessons that are easily applied to other diverse cities. This study will appeal to scholars of Eastern Europe, urban studies, and multiculturalism, as well as general readers interested in the region. © 2015 by Northern Illinois University Press.

76,18.0,2011,Article,Planning for sustainable urban areas or everyday life and inclusion,"This paper discusses the extent to which the diversity and equality agenda is being taken into account at street level as planners and urban designers seek to create sustainable settlements. The paper argues that many design policies inspired by the sustainability agenda do not take into account inclusive urban design considerations, and thus large sectors of the population are adversely affected. While attention is given to the needs of the disabled, particular emphasis is put in this paper upon the design needs of women and older people who together compose around a third of the population. The impact of compact layouts and higher densities in residential areas is first discussed, along with the problems created by increased car control, without commensurate transport policy alternatives, or adequate, safe pedestrian routeways. Second the problems of city centres are discussed where sustainability policy is also being targeted, but other priorities including the new urbanism, the 24-hour city, the evening economy and the city of culture jostle for pre-eminence. It is concluded that the lack of awareness of people's needs and inclusive design principles are reducing the chances of ordinary people accessing, comfortably moving around and enjoying the city. In order to bridge the gap between sustainability and inclusive design in planning, it is concluded that greater emphasis must be given to user needs and the constraints of everyday life.",Pavement design; Social impact; Sustainability,Greed C.,10.1680/udap.2011.164.2.107
77,18.0,2009,Article,"Town planning in postcolonial India, 1947-1965: Chandigarh re-examined","The objective of this article is to reassess the new town building movement in India from 1947 to 1965 through a re-examination of the making of Chandigarh, to show how nationalism, modernism, and local regional influences affected the design and building of new towns. Chandigarh emerged as part of the post-Partition need for a new capital for the Punjab, and involved the efforts of several people and levels of government. The context of newly achieved nationhood became important in the way it shaped the ideals of both national and local political leaders, who wanted architects to transfer these into built form. How successful the architects were in this enterprise was shaped by their professional ideologies and understanding (or lack of it) of the local. Much scholarship exists on issues such as early decisions about Chandigarh's establishment, the Mayer and Le Corbusier plans for the city, and the buildings comprising the Capitol complex that were designed by Le Corbusier. Much less attention has been given to the residential areas of Chandigarh and all that lay beyond the Capitol complex and constitutes the actual town. How did the ideas of modernism, the requirements of the nationalist state, and concern for the local shape the built environment? Was a Western urban design simply replicated here or were there modifications to suit locality and culture? Copyright © 2009 by Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.

78,18.0,2008,Article,"Scales, regimes, and the urban governance of Glasgow","Over the last two decades, urban regime theory has become one of the most dominant paradigms of thought in urban studies. In particular, regime theory offers a complex account of urban governance, or how local governments, the business communities, and community organizations gain the capacity to shape the policies that affect cities, that is, govern. Although regime theory is a dominant theory in urban studies, it does, nevertheless, have its share of detractors, and one criticism has been its failure to take into account geographical scale. While there is an acknowledgment in urban regime theory of wider economic processes, such as the broad transformations in international and national trade, investment, finance, etc., or the role played by federal or state governments, the bias has remained mostly local, particularly in regards to urban governance. In urban regime theory literature the policies and actions of international and national institutions either nicely conjoin with local interests or are nearly totally absent. Due to this oversight, urban regime theory tends to underemphasize how the capacity to govern a city effectively is sometimes the result of the interaction of actions of people at multiple scales. This article attempts to address this oversight in an analysis of Glasgow, Scotland, during the 1980s. By focusing on the role of the European City of Culture in the revitalization of the city, this article demonstrates how the capacity for a ruling coalition to transform the city and to govern effectively was the consequence of the policy and administrative actions undertaken at other geographical scales. © 2008 Urban Affairs Association.",,Tretter E.M.,10.1111/j.1467-9906.2007.00375.x

82,17.0,2010,Article,Study on building plan for enhancing the social health of public apartments,"Mass-produced in a short period of time, Korea's public apartments contributed to easing the housing anxiety of the common people. Nonetheless, they also gave rise to problems of social exclusion and conflict, becoming undesirable facilities that weakened social health. This study examined ways of producing an improved building plan that can raise the level of social health of public apartments, which were consistently built in the past but will no doubt continue to be developed in the future. For this study, the survey method was employed through a questionnaire with visual contents especially developed to raise the level of social health based on two ideas. One was to increase the possibility of social interaction among residents, and the other was to increase opportunities for residents to interact with society as well as for their social integration. The results showed that residents had mostly favorable views on the proposed plans: in particular, they favored highly the formation of a lobby in each apartment building as a venue for social interaction. They also responded very favorably to the plan of creating within the buildings spare space that will be used not only to promote a communal culture, but to open to outside society as well for integration. This study showed vital ideas to ensure the recovery of the residential function of promoting social health in the public apartments of Korea. It has significance in inspiring an innovative approach to allow social mixture in a relatively different feasible manner from the conventional approach. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is argued that central state, local state, church and voluntary agencies resort to different understandings of pity in order to acknowledge responsibility for different groups of homeless people and shape action in a variety of local settings. Official rhetoric addresses visible homelessness but conceals exclusions, selecting deserving from non-deserving clients and 'clean-ups' of public spaces. Radical voices aim at revealing hidden homelessness and sustain inclusive practices such as street or community work, but they fail to secure access for the homeless to housing, income and good quality of care. © 2004 The Editors of Urban Studies.",,Arapoglou V.P.,10.1080/0042098042000178717

In this wave of revival, many groups are marginalized, the reclaimed public space is often sanitized, gentrified and fortified, and not inclusive. However, there are urban public spaces that defy or at least resist these trends. Examining urban neighbourhood main streets reveals that even though the contemporary urban street can never be an unregulated place of unconstrained diversity, there are streets that counter the prevalent culture of consumption, and one can find visible signs of spontaneity and diversity of people and activities, and genuine social life. Using research in urban sociology, a taxonomy for sociability is developed, and the existing range of classifications of outdoor social activities is expanded. Through empirical examination, this paper explains how these streets perform as social spaces—how sociability is enacted, and what is the nature of planning, design and management, which supports social behaviours. Finally, the research emphasizes the role of the street as an ordinary public space in creating affordances for everyday social contacts that are crucial to personal well-being and social cohesion. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",Main streets; Public space; Sociability; Social life; Taxonomy; Urban design,Mehta V.,10.1057/s41289-018-0069-9
85,16.0,2010,Article,Community of trust: A socio-cultural approach for community planning and the case of Gaza,"This paper defines Community of Trust as socio-spatial settings in which there are substantial trust relationships among people and where they feel defended (safe) from internal risks. Our scheme suggests five categories of conditions that together create Communities of Trust: Shared place, shared daily-life practices, shared basic beliefs, and shared perceptions of community interests and risks. This scheme was examined in five communities in Gaza city. Data were collected first by informal talks with residents and local decision-makers and then by means of 973 personal interviews in residents' homes. Undoubtedly, the human conditions of the people of Gaza are among the worst in the world. Living conditions in the city have been difficult for the past century due to a number of factors, including: waves of incoming Palestinian refugees of the War of 1948, and decades of Israeli occupation. In spite of difficult housing conditions, poor services and the pressure of lasting internal risks, this study found livable communities and strong trust relationships among people of Gaza's communities. This article explains this by the high levels of agreement on basic beliefs, the shared daily-life practices, the strong shared perception towards external risks and a few common interests, which were found within each studied area. The last part of the paper is related to the issues of generalizing from the case of homogeneous urban community in Gaza to the frequently heterogeneous communities of Western cities. This study concludes that trust relationships are the corner-stone upon which communities are based anywhere in the world. Hence, in order to sustain communities, planners should support trust relationships among residents.

Many urban theorists consider open space as an important component of a healthy urban environment. It is well established in the literature that the utilisation of public space varies from context to context. This article investigates whether the utilisation of open space at the neighbourhood level is more associated with the physical and functional properties of open space or if it varies across different cultures and contexts of cities. This research adopts the method of comparative analysis, involving three case studies from different cultures, and climatic and geographical contexts. In each of these three cities, the opinions of residents and visitors about public open space were obtained and observation surveys were conducted to measure the utilisation of these spaces. The research found that the utilisation of public space at various levels of neighbourhood significantly differs between cities because of the local context, such as culture, social values and climate, instead of just being due to the physical and functional properties of open space. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",culture; design; local context; open space; people's perception; utilisation of open space,"Karuppannan S., Sivam A.",10.1057/udi.2012.34

The book reveals hardships the city encountered in the 1950s and the glamour enjoyed in the 1980s. It depicts the public and private developments, and especially the public housing which has sheltered millions of residents. The author identifies the architects practising in the formative years and the representatives of a rising generation after the 1980s. Suffering from land shortage and a dense environment, the urban development of Hong Kong has in the past 70 years met the changing demands of fluctuating economic activities and a rising population. Architecture on the island has been shaped by social demands, the economy and technology. The buildings have been forged by the government, clients, planners, architects, many contractors and end-users. The built environment nurtures our life and is visual evidence of the way the city has developed. Hong Kong is a key to East Asia in the Pacific Era. The book is a must-read for a thorough understanding the contemporary history and architecture of this oriental pearl. Endorsement: ""Hong Kong sets an extreme example of hyper-density living.

Although infrastructure is conceived and designed with particular goals and capacities, its temporal and spatial scale means that it is a constant work in progress that engages numerous agents: civic authorities design and implement infrastructure; designated agencies maintain and repair infrastructure; and ordinary people utilize, modify, ignore or destroy it. Infrastructure can be thus analyzed as a materialization of ongoing communication, in which there are often conflicts among different constituents to achieve consensus. The linguistic concepts of expert language and turn-taking are utilized to assess three brief case studies: historical New Orleans; a multipurpose micro-park in Vienna, Austria; and the archaeological city of Sisupalgarh, India. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",communication; consensus; identity; Infrastructure; performance; turn-taking,Smith M.L.,10.1080/00438243.2015.1124804
90,14.0,2014,Book,"Visual pollution: Advertising, signage and environmental quality","In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the problems that public spaces face because of the design of commercial signs. The negative consequences that commercial signs can have on the visual quality of urban areas and further more, on people's quality of life, has been studied from both architectural, planning and psychological perspectives. While the issue of visual pollution, as this phenomenon is commonly described, has been widely debated, there is as yet no clear conclusion as to how best to control commercial signage and whether different urban contexts and people from different backgrounds and cultures have universal or distinct preferences. Several different commenrcial signage approaches are currently applied to different historic cities, but these initiatives are not based on principles derived from the perception and evaluation of users. Drawing on a range of comparative and contrasting empirical studies of historic city centres in the UK and Brazil, this book examines questions of commercial signage control management, the preservation of historic heritage and user preference and satisfaction. The author takes an environment behaviour approach to this research, involving theories, concepts and methodologies related to environmental psychology, architecture, planning and urban design. In doing so, it argues that there are in fact visual preferences common to the majority of people, independent of their urban context and that these common views can be useful to the development of a general theory of how to control commercial signage. In conclusion, the book suggests that the best way of controlling signage is not only to recommend general guidelines related to the operation of commercial signage, but also to recommend design principles that can create commercial streetscapes evaluated positively by different users. © Adriana Portella 2014.

92,14.0,1989,Article,"Human Nature, Society and the Home","The New Psychology', which combines biology, psychology and the social sciences, is now generating considerable insights and debates. Such work gives special emphasis to 'the expressive orders; people's own understandings and statements deriving from the innate drives affecting their behaviour as well as the socially-constructed cultures of which they are part. Housing and urban studies, this paper suggests, should be part of these developments. Involvement in such issues should, for example, help us address questions which have recently been raised in Housing Studies by Saunders and Williams. They underlined the fact that the home is of central significance to the lives of individuals and they suggested that the significance of the home for contemporary social change has been underestimated. The intention of the present paper is to suggest that the new syntheses of ethology, sociobiology, social psychology and sociology might be one means of establishing the home's wider significance and its centrality to people's lives and identities. This paper concludes by arguing that housing studies could make major contributions to this emergent combination of the natural and social sciences. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

It should be kept in mind that while strategic planning and planning in general are opportunities for the government and dependent on political will, land-use planning, even in a simplified zoning form, is a necessity: the urban market needs it; there is no way of managing city growth without some form of grids and regulations.

99,12.0,2008,Editorial,Introduction modern architecture and the middle east: The burden of representation,"The essays in this volume investigate the contribution that local Middle Eastern contexts make to discourses in international modernism. The essayists define modernization not only as the extension of industrialized building processes and urban infrastructure, but also as the spread of ideals of progress and standards of comfort-which is to say, modernization is the ideology as well as the built framework for the administration of industrial societies. Architecture can help consolidate identity by providing both a degree of social cohesion and iconic forms that can become a source of pride for communities. Yet, for others, such architectural forms can become stereotypes that flatten culture into amere sign.Throughout these essays, one discerns an abiding concern for questions of representation, for how buildings and monuments-or in some cases, the lack of them- acquiremeaning, harden conviction, and set the spatial infrastructure for subsequent generations. The Middle East, with its diverse social, religious, and national histories, has often been seen by architects and academics as rich in traditional architecture but poor as a resource for understanding the Modern period. Europeans have idealized the Middle East as an almost timeless place, a region that stands in distinct and didactic contrast with the disruptive displacement and disillusionment that has resulted from its own industrialization.1 These essays describe the unique ways by which Middle Eastern countries have invented their own versions of modernism, sometimes aligned and sometimes at odds with more familiar European versions, and in varying relations with larger patterns of imperialism and colonialism. When individual designers and decision makers crossed national borders to build or to learn, to provide aid or extract resources, as architects, teachers, or tourists, the dichotomies of modern-traditional orWestern-Eastern did not truly hold. Our goal here is to build into the study of transnational architectural exchange the widest consideration of constituencies and the most extended opportunities for input.Contributors examine awide range of cultural encounters in terms of institutionalization of relationships, dynamic interactions of bureaucratic structures, and patterns of patronage amid debates over design and urban planning. Even local histories aremultiple, often disputed in their formation, and inevitably shifting over time. Taken together, they illustrate the various strategies that set national policies and decidewho is housed and who goes wanting, who is remembered and who is forgotten, and who is empowered to remake the built landscape. Several essays profile the individuals who helped realize certain specificallyMiddle Eastern forms of modernity. Some of them, such as European art historians and expatriate architects and archeologists, positioned themselves as the arbiters of Western knowledge, while others were seen as importingWestern ideals and technologies to theMiddle East. In other cases, institutions, such as governments or development agencies, assumed these roles. In many instances, however, cultural authority was as much a matter of dynamic transitions in political or architectural sympathies as it was the result of official credentials. These essays call attention to circuits of intention and response, which inflamed allegedly objective depictions of technological progress into heated debates regarding the nature of modernity itself. Modernism and the Middle East contextualizes the challenges facing building efforts today by placing themwithin a larger historical trajectory stretching from colonialism and the rise of nation-states to the present postcolonial search for local identity.By detailing howarchitecture has been integral to complex political ambitions and economic programs, the contributors make evident the historical roles played by competing visions of the built environment, as forms of representation and as ameans of directing capital and labor flows. With such attention to its deep traditions and rapidmodernization, the Middle East emerges as a rich setting for the study of modern architecture. Modernism and the Middle East begins at the cusp of the twentieth century amid the decline of colonialism and the rise of independent nation-states in regions once ruled by theOttomans (r. 1290-1924) in present-day Turkey and North Africa, and the Qajars (r. 1779-1924) in Iran (see fig. I.1).2 Under the dynastic leadership of the Sultan, overseer of the holy sites of Mecca andMedina and the supreme ruler of the Sunni Islamic world, the relatively stable and unified Ottoman Empire had administeredmuch of today's Middle East. But this administrative unity and geographic cohesion was eroded greatly during the nineteenth century, and it dissolved completely in the twentieth.3 Beyond the actual loss of land, Ottoman rule was disrupted by major infrastructure developments, most notably the Suez Canal (1854-69), which brought French and, later, English capital and technology to Egypt.4 By the twilight of World War I, in 1918, Istanbul had itself come under Allied control, and the six-hundred-year-oldOttoman Empire came to an end, its former lands divided into areas administered by the French (Syria and Lebanon) and the British (Iraq and Palestine).5 Even as newnations emerged with at least nominal sovereignty from the Mandate period, the idea of a coherent, if not exactly cohesive, Middle East was reinforced. The Mandates carved new political entities, such as Palestine and Iraq, out of former Ottoman administrative zones, but it kept these nations from being fully independent, and left them wanting in terms of industrial development. At the same time, European occupation sparked nationalist movements in neighboring Turkey and Iran, resulting in the overthrow of puppet monarchies and the rise of charismatic military leaders,who threwoff centuries of imperial rule and modernized in the name of national progress. The advent of Mustafa Kemal in Turkey (1919) and Riza Khan in Iran (1921) brought new modes of judicial and educational reforms (often based on European models), in an effort to forge homogeneous, if fictive, native identities.6 The characterization of entire peoples by their positions along the trajectory of history and modernization was asmuch embraced by regional leaders as it was imposed by European power and ideology. Oil came to be written into this idea of a cohesive Middle East as much by its discovery there as by the increasing industrial thirst for sources of fuel. The image of Arab states unified by oceans of oil lying unseen beneath their soil emerged in the nineteenth centurywith the advent of a British-controlled Anglo-Persian oil company. It was extended as new fields were discovered, such as those in Iraq in the 1930s and those in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia by 1945. With the institution of the American's Marshall Plan (1948-52), the European economy was reconfigured according to American precepts, resulting in an emphasis on continued growth in productivity and an even greater dependence on oil. The Middle East thus moved to the center of foreign-policy strategies for a number of Western nations, becoming also a site of contentious ideological positioning between the Soviet Union and the United States, with both nations acting out their political differences through technical aid and development projects as well as cultural exports. Although some small Persian Gulf monarchies enjoyed considerable advantages over their oil-poor neighbors, toWesterners the regionmaintained its conceptual integrity as a site of superpower struggle and vast economic opportunity.7 The creation of the state of Israel, on May 14, 1948, also helped consolidate an idea of the Middle East, albeit in a way unanticipated by mostWestern politicians. Although Jewish immigration to the area in the first half of the twentieth century had profoundly accected the economic and demographic character of Mandate Palestine, the United Nations' 1947 plan to partition the area into Jewish and Arab states,whichwas rejected by the Arab League, formed in 1945, seemed only to reassert Western colonialism at the very moment it was breaking apart elsewhere. Within this context, theMiddle Eastmust be historically situated as a place defined both by European colonial interests and by the specific imperial configurations that had existed in the region. Just as the specter of essentialism hovers over the term ""Middle East,"" one may argue that it also haunts the idea of a homogeneous ""Europe""; nonetheless, as Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued in another context, these terms highlight, rather than obfuscate, the problematic of domination and intellectual dependency that permeates any discussion of these two entities.8 The interdependency of Europe and the Middle East can be seen in the unfolding of an ""Oriental"" supplement to European identity: what was understood by nineteenth-century policymakers as the ""Eastern question"" had to do less with the inhabitants of these regions than with the raw currency of human labor and material wealth promised through imperialism. © 2008 by University of Washington Press.

100,11.0,2015,Book,"Cosmology, calendars, and horizon-based astronomy in ancient mesoamerica","Cosmology, Calendars, and Horizon-Based Astronomy in Ancient Mesoamerica is an interdisciplinary tour de force that establishes the critical role astronomy played in the religious and civic lives of the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica. Providing extraordinary examples of how pre-Columbian peoples merged ideas about the cosmos with those concerning calendar and astronomy, the volume showcases the value of detailed examinations of astronomical data for understanding ancient cultures. The volume is divided into three sections: Investigations into Mesoamerican horizon-based astronomy, the cosmological principles expressed in Mesoamerican religious imagery and rituals related to astronomy, and the aspects of Mesoamerican calendars related to archaeoastronomy. It also provides cutting-edge research on diverse topics such as records of calendar and horizon-based astronomical observation (like the Dresden and Borgia codices), iconography of burial assemblages, architectural alignment studies, urban planning, and counting or measuring devices. Contributors—who are among the most respected in their fields— explore new dimensions in Mesoamerican timekeeping and skywatching in the Olmec, Maya, Teotihuacano, Zapotec, and Aztec cultures. It will be of great interest to students and scholars of anthropology, archaeology, art history, and astronomy. © 2015 by University Press of Colorado.",,Milbrath S.,
101,11.0,2014,Article,"Indigenous Rough Sleeping in Darwin, Australia: 'Out of Place' in an Urban Setting","Much of what is known of street homelessness is informed by accounts from urban centres throughout North America and the UK. The nature of the problem and the ways in which it is addressed are implicitly assumed to be similar across diverse major cities. The street homeless are thought to be highly marginalised and vulnerable. In turn, contemporary policy aims to provide housing/accommodation and welfare to address this form of homelessness as deep exclusion. Based on empirical research in Australia's northernmost capital city, Darwin, this article demonstrates the role of culture in how homelessness is experienced and addressed. It argues that cultural mobility and modes of behaviour that normalise rough sleeping are embedded within condoned poverty and discriminatory legislation directed towards Indigenous people. Indigenous people are constructed as out of place in urban environments and rather than housing and welfare, the focus is directed towards moving the problem. © 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.",,"Parsell C., Phillips R.",10.1177/0042098013484541

This distinctive opportunity has lead the authors to explore a form of design brief and virtual design studio (VDS) format not well addressed in the literature. Instead of sharing the same design brief, students in this alternative format design a project in the other students' city and do not collaborate on the same design. Collaboration with other students takes the form of teaching each other about the city and culture served by the design. The authors discovered these studios produce a focus on site context that serves our pedagogical objectives - a blend of architectural, landscape architectural and urban design knowledge. Their students use a range of commercial CAD and computer supported collaborative work (CSCW) software common to that used in many VDS experiments reported on in the literature. However, this conventional use of technology is contrasted with a second distinctive characteristic of these studios, the use of custom software tools specifically designed to support synchronous and asynchronous three-dimensional model exchange and linked attribute knowledge. The paper analyzes some of the virtual design studio (VDS) work between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, the University of Toronto, and the University of Melbourne.

105,10.0,2019,Conference Paper,Enablers and Barriers of Lean Implementation in Construction Projects,"Lean aims to maximize customer satisfaction while minimizing waste. However, Lean philosophy has not been well understood yet in the construction industry for the fact that the complexity and dynamic nature of construction projects bring up uncertainties that may be hardly handled by construction practitioners. Moreover, project-based nature of construction business makes Lean implementation even more challenging for construction people. Even though Lean efforts in construction have recently increased, there are problems with the implementation processes. It is undeniable that successful Lean implementation strongly affects project performance. Therefore, it is essential to reveal enablers and barriers in Lean implementation so that the construction industry practitioners might conduct projects more effectively and satisfy project requirements (i.e. schedule, budget, safety). This study aims to provide a set of core enablers and barriers of Lean implementation in construction projects and guide construction professionals to better satisfy project requirements. Within this context, the study proposes seven major enabler and barrier groups, namely the financial, managerial, technical, workforce, culture, government, and communication and twenty-seven components for each group. Moreover, a survey was designed and administered to Lean practitioners to rank the enablers and barriers based on importance level. Clear understanding of technical requirements in Lean practices was ranked as the most important enabler of Lean implementation whereas lack of top management support was ranked as the most important barrier in the Lean implementation. However, the average rankings were not found to be diverging indicating that selected components of enabler and barrier groups are properly chosen. The study is expected to lead Lean practitioners with creating value to customers while preventing them from experiencing waste. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bayhan H.G., Demirkesen S., Jayamanne E.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/2/022002
111,9.0,2016,Article,The Role of the Built Environment in Human Life. Selected Issues,"Creation of the built environment and research in this field pose a particularly difficult challenge nowadays. The pace of social and technological change does not allow for evolutionary development of cities and the formation of their land use according to current conditions. Creating spatial solutions that are unmatched in their contexts is becoming not only possible, but very probable (see Alexander, 1964). The development of the built environment involves not only art, technology, history, economics and law, but also philosophy, culture, medicine, psychology, sociology and many other spheres in which human life is manifested. However, only a relatively small number of disciplines such as spatial planning, urban design, urban planning, etc. (ignoring at this point the differences in the meaning of the concepts) in their application layer are meant to create space and bear responsibility for it. Also society has certain requirements of practical nature towards them. This article attempts to outline the nature of research on space urbanised by people and to determine the four main fields of research aimed at the problems of man and the built environment. In the next part, particular attention is paid to issues related to the impact of the built environment on the life of its residents in order to highlight the particular role and complexity of this area of research. This study, acting as a kind of test of the research, cannot be considered representative. Nevertheless, the analysis prompts several reflections on the current and future role of the built environment in the development of our civilisation, as well as further challenges related to it. © 2016 European Spatial Research and Policy 2016.",built environment; physical environment; quality of life; spatial planning; urban planning,Lamprecht M.,10.1515/esrp-2016-0011

Efforts should therefore be concentrated on accommodating this phenomenon through the promotion of sustainable urban planning and development. Relying on secondary data, this paper examines models of indigenous African urban forms and architecture to understand these forms and their characteristics, and how these models and associated management, design, and planning principles can be adopted in contemporary SSA urban development in the quest to achieve sustainable urban development. This paper argues that planning is culturally and contextually defined and the specificities of a place are critical in planning. Developing strategies based on indigenous urban forms which embody local peoples' culture, aspirations, experiences, and values is consistent with the concept of sustainable urban development. The article concludes that there exist clear elements of socially, politically, economically, culturally, and environmentally sound and responsive sustainable planning principles to be derived from indigenous urban forms and architecture which can inform current urban development process in SSA. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",indigenous; Sub-Saharan Africa; sustainable urban development; urban form,Asomani-Boateng R.,10.1080/17549175.2011.634573
115,9.0,2007,Article,Information technologies and civic engagement: Perspectives from librarianship and planning,"Urban planning and librarianship are parallel fields in many ways. Both have theoretical and practical underpinnings driving each discipline; are interdisciplinary in focus; and both professions gather and disseminate information to stakeholders. Essential to the success of each discipline is an engaged user population. The authors use a case study from the Village of Oak Park to examine and reflect upon the effect of the Internet and other technologies in the public's ability to participate in an open planning process. The Village of Oak Park is known for its architectural heritage and outspoken community. Within its 4.5 square miles live a diverse population of approximately 52,000 people from different cultures, races, ethnicities, professions, lifestyles, religions, ages, and incomes where a majority of the population have some advanced education and over 80% of the households report home Internet use. How does a community like the Village of Oak Park engage in the planning process? What role does information play in this process? Can modern Information Technologies facilitate civic engagement? These questions are examined during a year-long case study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in cooperation with the Village of Oak Park (VOP). Specifically, the investigators examined how information is gathered and used in the planning process and how the introduction of Information Technology (IT) tools influenced public participation and introduced many citizens to e-government through the planning process. The use of these tools is compared to the traditional planning process. Data from the project is presented to demonstrate a different kind of role librarians play in the research process. Last, the authors discuss the role of privacy in the gathering and sharing of information with the reliability of that information and the impact of privacy on the public planning process. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

116,9.0,2000,Article,Integrative analysis of city systems: Bangkok 'man and the biosphere' programme study,"This paper argues that integrative analysis of city systems helps us to see beyond their current environmental and social problems to underlying causes, and it suggests different opportunities for possible interventions. Focusing on a single aspect of a city or its people without understanding its context risks interventions which treat symptoms rather than causes and whose short-term 'solution' often means that the problem returns in the same or perhaps a different form. Our integrative analysis of Bangkok suggests that the root of its environmental (and some social) problems lie in decision-making structures and a political culture which has historically fostered self interested decisions by stakeholders rather than the public interest. This has produced a land use and built environment configuration that largely ignores the functioning of the natural flood plain ecosystem and the well-being of residents. People adapt their behaviour to their environment but often in ways that have serious cumulative impacts on the city. This analysis suggests that problems need to be addressed at their source: the nature of decision-making by stakeholders, at every level. This requires the engagement of all parties inside and outside government, the elite and otherwise. To the extent that planning has a viable role, the focus needs to be on the source of the impacts, such as national development planning, rather than in sectors such as transport, where the problems are evident.",,"Ross H., Poungsomlee A., Punpuing S., Archavanitkul K.",10.1177/095624780001200212
117,9.0,1980,Article,Chicago sociology and urban planning policy - Sociological theory as occupational ideology,"This account has provided one illustration of the possibility of an alternative approach to the sociology of knowledge other than the ""reductionist"" analysis of ideas as mere epiphenomena of material interests. If the sociology of knowledge cannot be pursued in any other fashion, the field's oft-lamented neglect seems entirely justifiable. But sociologists of knowledge can choose to define the purpose of their work, not as the exposure of perceptual distortions conditioned by social position, but as the elucidation of factors which lend certain formulations plausibility within a given socio-cultural context. Ironically, such explication of the relationship of ideology to work has been consonant with the developing Chicago tradition, although not unique to it, for Chicagoans have been concerned to elucidate the means by ""which people respond creatively to the limitations of their institutional context."" As we have seen, the pre-World War II manifestation of that tradition has permitted urban bureaucrats to maximize their possibilities for action within the constraints of their formal obligations. Not only has their faith in the accuracy of evolutionist predictions sustained civil servants in the belief that they have maintained value-neutrality, but it has also allowed them to enjoy the pleasures of power and concrete accomplishment. For the city is conceptualized as an ever-expanding frontier, perpetually subjected to cycles of devastation and construction. Hence, while ostensibly acting as instruments of inexorable historical forces, urban bureaucrats are constantly provided with opportunities to raise tangible monuments to their personal authority. And evolutionist sociology has sanctioned a viable occupational strategy for the bureaucrat qua bureaucrat, for it justifies the civil servants' favored relationship with powerful clients, allowing them to negotiate their continued occupational survival. Although Chicago sociology has proved useful to planning professionals, I do not mean to suggest that its creators would have approved of the consequences of bureaucratic activity. In fact, both in method and substance the practices of government agencies have violated the human ecologists' ideal; Chicagoan Louis Wirth deplored planners' operational categories, arguing that they should be replaced with more sophisticated sociological ones. More importantly, federal officials used Chicago sociologists' projections to support policies counter to the Chicagoans' prescriptions for civilized society. Government policy has been effectively anti-urban. Based on the Chicago evolutionists' model, and in the name of sound business practices, central city decline has been assured and suburban expansion facilitated. Chicago sociologists saw conflict arising from large-scale urban migration and rapid industrialization, but they accepted conflict as necessary to progress; the highest development of civilization required diversity and an urban milieu. Within the city various groups created homogeneous communities, but heterogeneity of the population as a whole was essential to urban culture. Federal agencies, while adhering to the sociologists' premises, turned the model on its head; they sought to minimize conflict by eradicating social heterogeneity, and encouraged the growth of homogeneous suburban neighborhoods in which residents were protected from alien persons and lifestyles. © 1980 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.",,Kuklick H.,10.1007/BF00169091
119,8.0,2020,Article,Investigating learning and diffusion strategies for sustainable mobility,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the concepts of learning and diffusion within the context of urban development and sustainable active mobility. A model is proposed, which treats learning as a diffusion process in a dynamic way, so that key strategies and their effects are investigated over time. Specifically, the question being examined is how learning and information technology strategies can change the mindset of people to be more physically active in their mobility around a city. This is carried out by developing a system dynamics (SD) computer simulation model, where learning strategies that promote walking can be tested prior to implementation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the specific key stages of knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation, the proposed SD model incorporates individual citizen and group level learning and diffusion processes in a unified integrated approach. The SD model gives a clear picture on how learning and changing mindsets occur in the context of a city, whereby we can explore the main drivers to learn new sustainability related habits. A case study is used to contextualize and demostrate the active mobility issue, in order to develop practical scenarios for promoting a walking mindset. This is done in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the model and show its practicality. Through the model we investigate the relationships among variables such as awareness, contact, communication and adoption and evaluate their impact on city policies to promote a walking mindset. Findings: The developed SD model exhibits important dimensions, such as social learning, motivation to change behaviour and an analysis of the effects of plausible strategies for promoting sustainable active mobility. The authors have proven that through simulation experimentation, we can significantly accelerate the shaping and diffusion of a walking mindset, by influencing individual and community learning via the introduction of Information and Communication Technology in conjunction with an awareness campaign strategy. Research limitations/implications: The diagrammatic representation and the quantification of the factors that contribute to active mobility give rise to better understanding of how policy makers could promote a walking culture in a city. The implications are that the proposed SD model could be used by city planning authorities as a framework for shaping mindsets towards active and sustainable mobility. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the further understanding of learning, diffusion of new ideas and strategic planning within the city context. Through the proposed SD model, a number of strategies are formulated and tested using scenario planning, sensitivity analysis and optimization, in order to develop a walking mindset and an urban culture of sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Active mobility; Diffusion theory; Learning capability; Organizational learning; System dynamics; Urban development,"Papageorgiou G., Demetriou G.",10.1108/SASBE-02-2019-0020

Minecraft is employed as an innovative tool to tackle the present lack of engagement and involvement of key societal actors such as children and young people in urban planning. Thus, how can games support children to co-design their future city? Which heritage values do they represent graphically in the game environment? Geogames are games that provide a visualization of a real spatial context and in this study, Minecraft is the tool which we use to explore youth engagement. We designed two experiments, which tested Minecraft as a geogame environment for engaging young people in urban planning. These experiments were conducted with children, who emerged as active emancipated actors to bring their values to the planning practice. The playtesting results revealed the potential of Minecraft to keep children engaged in the design workshop, as well as their relevant ludic ability to co-create walkable, green, and interactive places. New research questions arose about the potential of creating a culture of planning among children in order to motivate other social actors to share responsibilities for sustainable development and management. © 2020 by the authors.",Children’s engagement; Geogames; Minecraft; Urban planning,"de Andrade B., Poplin A., de Sena Í.S.",10.3390/ijgi9030170

Despite lip-service to ""triple bottom line"" assessments of policies and developments, Australia's policymakers have advanced no further than a ""double bottom line"" based on economic and environmental values, the latter preferably expressed in dollar terms. The economic (or market relation) also substitutes for the social dimension in a continued policy emphasis on customers rather than citizens or community members. An overemphasis on behavioural economics, a lack of social, political and cultural theory, and neglect of people's actual practices means that much policy and research around water fails to grapple with such basic social elements as gender, different roles and access to resources within households, cultural diversity, or ethical orientations. A major challenge is to mobilise rather than ignore the altruistic and socially-oriented human capacities for adapting to change beyond the customer relation or the confines of technical and economic rationality; including by collective innovations in values and practices of caring for water. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.",Cultural innovation; Customer behaviour; Gender and water; Household water; Socially sustainable urban water; Sustainability models,Sofoulis Z.,10.7158/W13-018.2013.17.2

129,8.0,2005,Article,The transitional space in the traditional urban settlement of Cyprus,"The interactions between public and private, people and environment, open and closed, inside and outside, and part and whole are important design criteria in traditional environments. This interaction and indissoluble whole of the fabric, transitional space, which is described as the overlapping of indoor and outdoor spaces, has great importance. In different cultures, transitional spaces have different names: arcade, engawa, vestibule, eiwan, and hayat. It is commonly named sündürme in Cyprus. Sündürme is the essential component that determines the spatial patterns and formal configurations in the traditional architecture of Cyprus. At the same time, it is the forthcoming transition device between traditional and contemporary environments of Cyprus. Through open and renewed interpretations, sündürme has the potential to be a cultural transition that can achieve continuity of traditional values and maintain physically and socially satisfying environments. Furthermore, any planning and designing strategy that considers the potential of sündürme in new housing developments as a shared image of all communities living on the island could contribute to the sociopolitical process. Under this scope, this study points out the cultural and architectural role of sündürme and describes its spatial, functional, and climatic characteristics by referring to the formal analysis results of 154 houses. The study aims to draw attention to the importance of sündürme in the development of living environments towards achieving better living conditions and a higher quality of living environments, while maintaining the spirit of the social and cultural lifestyles of the past and possibly integrating them with the requirements of our time.

COVID-19-induced immobility in the mobile risk society,"Since the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declared the Coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic, the virus has invaded lives around the globe. The ongoing health, social and economic crisis that followed forced urban life, business, culture, community etc. into idle mode for weeks resulting from mandated immobility. What was once taken for granted as the essence of urban experience such as cultural activities, meeting friends, relatives and colleagues in public space or in professional encounters, disappeared overnight. Free movement became significantly restricted all over the world. It seemed that immobility, social and physical distancing, and isolation were the only antidote to the fast-moving virus. For many people, working from home while also schooling their children and providing social care at a distance, peak activity at maximum physical immobility became the “new normal.” A culture emerged where rules and norms of mobilities previously taken for granted were re-negotiated and re-defined. Before the crisis and despite the negative ecological side effects, mobility has been positively connotated as a signifier for progress and success. Under the Corona regime mobility turned into a life-threatening risk.

In underdeveloped countries this fact is expressed in a chaotic manner, generating social and structural problems. The city of Rio de Janeiro is a megalopolis known worldwide for its natural beauties, including beaches and forests and because of favelas (subnormal clusters of houses of economically poor people).The favelas are composed of a mosaic of cultures which reflects even in urban afforestation. In this work we characterize the afforestation structure of a favela to understand its ecological and social functionalities. The survey was conducted in the favela Morro da Formiga, with an area of approximately 30 ha. It was conducted through a census and using the list of species, a classification based on 11 parameters was carried out. 1,042 individuals were found, belonging to 110 genera, 148 species and 42 families. The most abundant species shows that the planters intend is, leastwise partially, generating an extra-support for community in terms of feeding fruits (62% of the subjects had this purpose). In relation to the nature thereof, the natives species represents 54% of the total, while the exotic species 39%. About 50% of the trees are in the backyards of houses and a few in squares and streets. It was found that 70% of individuals were planted by residents. Studies are needed to identify which native species can replace community demands currently supplied by exotic species that have been used for decades. The “forestation” in favelas is quite distinct from that implemented by the city hall in more urbanized areas.

The following available research methods of evaluation were used: analysis of literature, observational in-situ studies of objects and own research. Analysis were performed on dozens of bridges constructed over the centuries.

Specifically, the article explores the relationship between the spatial dynamics of the conflicts-in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity-and the following four dimensions of urban space: social composition; built environment; propensity to associate and to voice; and accessibility to various urban resources. The results of statistical analyses by means of a Kruskal-Wallis test and a Mann-Whitney test show, regardless of the dimension considered, to what extent certain areas are characterized by frequency, duration, or intensity of the conflict activity. Specifically, the results suggest that the degree of involvement of local people in a conflict varies very much depending on the nature of the social composition. Other findings show a relationship between areas with a high propensity to associate and to voice and a conflict activity that is more intense, more frequent, but not necessarily longer. These forms of social practices are thus testimony to the existence of know-how, i.e., a culture of conflict activity oriented towards efficiency. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Spatial analysis; Statistical analysis; Territorial decision-making processes; Urban conflicts; Urban environments,"Pelletier M., Joerin F., Kestens Y., Villeneuve P.Y.",10.1007/s12061-010-9050-8
138,7.0,2010,Conference Paper,Extending boundaries with meta-design and cultures of participation,"Human-computer interaction (HCI) has refocused many research efforts within computer science from a technology-centered view to a human-centered view. The developments so far, however, have seen humans mostly as users and consumers rather than as active contributors and designers. This paper provides a conceptual framework based on meta-design and cultures of participation that democratize design and allows all stakeholders to evolve systems to fit their needs. It establishes a new extended discourse for HCI research in which information technologies are interwoven with human lives in all aspects of our existence (at home, working, teaching, learning, and being a citizen). Specific socio-technical environments instantiating the framework in different application domains are described, including: (1) environments for people with cognitive disabilities, (2) table-top computing systems for framing and solving complex urban planning problems, (3) modeling the buildings of the world in 3D, and (4) using Smart Grids to support energy sustainability. These examples show how metadesign and cultures of participation are design approaches that allow researchers and practitioners to extend boundaries by allowing all stakeholders to have more control over their artifacts and by providing opportunities to encourage and to support contributions by many people in personally meaningful activ ities. © 2010 ACM.",Boundaries; Control; Cultures of participation; Distances; Meta-design; Motivation; Socio-technical environments; Systemic problems,Fischer G.,10.1145/1868914.1868937
139,7.0,2010,Article,Rethinking urban design for a changing public life,"Purpose – The nature and conceptualization of public space and public life have been always associated with collective participation and socialization – in other words, the capacity to live together among strangers. Today these associations seem to have become challenged and problematic, and often end in questioning whether public space still matters for our public life? This paper aims to bring new understanding to the reading of public life in public spaces and also contribute to rethinking of the role of urban design today within our changing public life. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts participant/observation within a case/study area, “Parque das Nações”, in Lisbon, Portugal. Findings – The paper identifies a number of spatial, social and experiential conditions that are conducive to social interactions amongst strangers. Often it is the combination of three factors that generates the most interaction. Research limitations/implications – Participant observation is a useful method to study public behaviour in the public realm. Nevertheless, as the study was conducted in one location, the findings may not be transferable to other locations/cultures, etc. Practical implications – This paper demonstrates the need to rethink and adapt urban design practices to an increasing changing public life. Urban design needs to be much more sensitive to all locations (planned and unplanned) and the favourable spatial, experiential and social conditions people make use of and which can provoke positive interactions need to be recognised. Social implications A better understanding of the factors that are conducive to positive interaction between strangers and non/strangers in the public realm will help to develop more favourable conditions for these to take place. The interaction between people is part of the fabric of social life. Originality/value – This is the first paper to combine social/spatial and experiential factors in the observation of social interaction in public places. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Physical planning; Portugal; Social interaction; Urban areas,Simões Aelbrecht P.,10.1108/17538331011062667

The findings reveal that a good quality of life for the dying person and his or her family and friends is essential for a good death. The resulting conceptual model emphasized four dimensions: physical, spiritual, social, and emotional/psychological. These dimensions were determined to be similar to those discovered through a previous urban study, indicating that there may be considerable overlap between good deaths in rural and urban areas. Some findings of this Quebec French-language rural study were similar to those of an Alberta English-language rural study, indicating that rural people may have some common needs and interests with regard to the good death. As such, there could be some common elements of the good death that transcend culture or ethnicity.

Public Art in Canada broadens the critical discussion by exploring public art's varied means of engaging with public space and the public sphere. Annie Gérin and James S. McLean have assembled contributions from new and established Canadian scholars, curators, and artists. Each contributor enlivens our understanding of public art as a practice and its place in the social and aesthetic formation of which it is a part. As a result, the book provides an overview of the current debates in the field of public art that are informed by the theories and critical literature of art history, communication studies, cultural studies, sociology, and urban studies. The rigorous essays and original works of art collected in this volume present a compelling demonstration of the strategies, aesthetic and otherwise, used by artists to elicit intellectual, sensual, or emotional responses that can only be obtained through artistic practices in public places.

143,6.0,2018,Article,"Racial projections: cyberspace, public space, and the digital divide","Scholars of critical race studies, urban history, and information and communications technologies (ICTs) share an interest in the relationship between spatial and racial disparities, including the quality of basic infrastructure, degrees of connectivity, and participatory culture. However, contemporary research on the digital divide struggles to link historical legacies of uneven development, as well as social justice strategies, with digital participation in urban spaces. By examining contemporary digital art that critiques the spatial inequalities encountered by U.S. racial minorities, this article illustrates how public intellectuals use ICTs in ways that draw upon past strategies to territorialize space for political ends. It focuses on digital pop-ups, open-air installations that cast images onto public space using projectors. Historicizing these new efforts illustrates a continuity of tactics engaged by communities of color in response to socio-spatial inequalities in the urban United States, such as the 1970s mural movement’s efforts to re-politicize spaces of exclusion. While existing literature finds that digital inequality results in differential digital human capital, this research indicates that place-based claims, such as digital pop-ups, are important sites for combatting racial injustice and creating more inclusionary spaces, especially among youth adults. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital arts; Digital divide; race; urban studies; young people,Carpio G.G.,10.1080/1369118X.2016.1271899
144,6.0,2017,Article,"Disruption, resilience, and vernacular heritage in an Indian city: Pune after the 1961 floods","This paper offers insights into production of vernacular architectural heritage that result from disruption caused by disaster such as a flood in a city. To understand the complexities surrounding vernacular heritage, this paper proposes a conceptual approach derived from Lefebvre’s theory of production of space constituting the triad of spatial practice, representation of spaces and representational space. The strength of this approach in explaining resilience and vernacular architectural heritage is illustrated by examining rehabilitation settlements that evolved after the devastating floods of 1961 in Pune (a city with a population of 4.5 million). The paper focuses on the rehabilitation process that was undertaken in response to the floods and relies on secondary data and primary field observations in the rehabilitated settlements. It was found that these settlements had twofold characteristics; externally, they directed the trajectory of growth and expansion of the city owing to their strategic location in the periphery around the old core, and internally within, they contributed to reshaping of urban form and vernacular architecture as the affected people reconstructed their houses and everyday lives. A significant contribution to the making of these rehabilitation spaces was the state’s provision of land for rehabilitation and encouragement to the mechanism of Cooperative Housing as a representation of space incorporating contemporary planning ideologies. These settlements comprised the ‘architecture of the dispossessed’ where material culture and imagery informed different and hybrid forms of houses but these were a departure from the past as they needed to accommodate rebuilding and expansion while serving aspirations of those affected. © 2016, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2016.",disruption; floods; heritage; India; Pune; resilience; vernacular architecture,Shinde K.A.,10.1177/0042098016652777

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology consisted mostly of in-loco observations, pedestrian counts and extensive reviews of the literature, city plans and regulations. Findings: The findings include the need to properly design, maintain and retrofit pedestrian facilities, while reducing safety conflicts among street users as well as the establishment and the nurturing of a culture of walking. Research limitations/implications: A fivefold international walkability research agenda with implications for other cities around the world is established: the value and the need for comparative studies and best practices; the need for urban design interventions; the cultivation of attractiveness and aesthetics; the implementation of safety, construction and maintenance criteria; and responsible funding programs. Practical implications: This paper has twofold implications for stakeholders with direct responsibilities in the design, planning, building and maintenance of streets and public spaces, and for those who simply use those places at their own discretion. Social implications: A succinct set of recommendations include the need to augment endogeneity, the need to make cities for people and not for automobiles and commitment to resolving pedestrian safety concerns. Originality/value: This paper discusses the factors affecting street vibrancy from both a stakeholder’s and a user’s perspective.

146,6.0,2015,Book Chapter,Festive Cities: Multi-Dimensional Perspectives,"Until recently there has been limited attention paid in urban studies to features that relate to sensory, not material features, to consumption not production, pleasure not work, and to episodic rather than permanent characteristics. However festivals, episodic events lasting a few days, do provide such functions. They take people outside their routine behaviours of work, leisure and family, providing joy, excitement and new experiences, sometimes linking to historical traditions. Although such events have always been part of the life of the bigger places, new valuations of their utility have led to an enormous growth in such activities in recent decades, both in numbers within cities, and many other urban places, adding to their vitality and often providing major economic returns. A review of the variety of festivals shows that most fall into six main types, linked to temporal or cyclical, religious, political, tradition-heritage, new cultures and lifestyle functions, although some may overlap the categories and others have morphed from one type to another through time. A multidimensional model of the nature of festivals based on eight components provides a basis for assessing their varied character and reveals their often contradictory nature and conflicted consequences. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Festival dimensions; Festival growth; Festival impacts; Festival typology,Davies W.K.D.,10.1007/978-94-017-9655-2_14
147,6.0,2013,Article,From designed spaces to designer savvy societies: The potential of ideas competitions in willing participation,"The design of public space has gained importance as cities are increasingly positioned in global flows of people, capital, and ideas. These spaces speak to the culture of a place as much as to the quality of its design, but the implementation of design as an inclusive process is fraught with difficulty. This is particularly pertinent in discussions about better ways of engaging people with urban design, where there is often a language barrier between those who specialise in spatial manipulation and the broader 'society' that uses this space. This paper gives an empirical account of how a spatial consciousness can be translated to society through an international design competition. The competition method of urban design relies upon promotion and 'eventfulness', both of which interpolate the public and contribute towards the generation of a deeper interest in the spatial imaginary of city planning. The creation of 'urban design consumers' through the visual consumption of the designs themselves offers an alternative way to gain public interest to the established traditions of public notices and formal public meetings. In this case, the competition extended the activity of urban designers beyond the mechanics of 'space production' to include 'consumer production' where a more intimate relationship between city planning and the people began to emerge.",Competition; Consumerism; Public spaces; Urban design,Picken F.,10.1068/a45460
148,6.0,2011,Article,Small businesses and the vitality of main street,"People use the neighborhood Main Street for shopping but also for other leisurely activities, active and passive engagement, social affiliation and interaction, sensory stimulation, and relaxation. Traditionally, small businesses have made up a fair share of businesses on Main Street. Small businesses have been an integral part of the American culture of entrepreneurship, individualism, and self-reliance and have played an important role in American economic development. Community development programs recommend supporting small businesses for their social and economic benefits. This paper examines the role of small businesses in supporting public life on the neighborhood Main Street. The study urn conducted in two cities and one town in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. Extensive behavior mapping and interviews were conducted to determine the relationship between social interaction and small businesses. The findings expand our understanding of the social value of small businesses and suggest a strong relationship between small businesses and the vitality of Main Street as a result offour qualities of small businesses: uniqueness, engagement, friendliness, and responsiveness. These findings have implications for urban design, community planning, and economic development policies because they suggest that small businesses influence their immediate public space by paying more attention to it than large businesses. Small businesses provide qualities that help make Main Street a good place for people to interact. © 2011, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc.",,Mehta V.,

152,6.0,1996,Article,The urban fabric of Igbo architecture in South-eastern Nigeria in the 1990s,"This paper seeks to explore the extent to which local building traditions have been retained within modern urban housing development in primarily Igbo-speaking areas of South-eastern Nigeria in the 1990s. Its premise is that there are vestiges of tradition which remain part of the urban fabric in most southern Nigerian towns. It is thought that these traditions can, and should, be developed further to ensure that there is a positive integration of the old with the new, in the physical form, aesthetics and theoretical interpretation of urban design. Also as a development model, this integration approach has considerable relevance to other aspects of Nigerian urban life where there is the need for the accommodation of various cultures and social backgrounds. Relevant material, including documented data, will be used to discuss the premises and theories put forward. Central to the main theme is the argument for a re-ordering of architectural design and urban planning in southern Nigeria to better accommodate the more traditional or cultural features of life as the illustrations shown will highlight. The paper focuses specifically on the Igbo-speaking area of South-eastern Nigeria. The development of its housing fabric has varied distinctly from that of Northern and South-western Nigeria, which both have the effects of Islamic influence and, in the latter region, Brazilian and European influence, on local culture to be considered. Both these regions have had more urbanised and cosmopolitan cultural indigenous development patterns than the south-east. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with these Nigerian regions and other developing areas. It would seem that 'Igboland' escaped these influences mainly due to its geographical location in the hinterland of South-eastern Nigeria. Islam did not penetrate as far down from North-eastern Nigeria to the south-east as it had done from North-western Nigeria to the south-west. This was partly due to the more tropical humid terrain which was detrimental to horses and mounted warfare and the way in which religious wars or Jihads were traditionally fought. Also, the acephalous societal organisation of the Igbos, when contrasted with the more hierarchical Northern Hausa and Western Yoruba societies, were less predisposed to convert voluntarily from native individualised worship to a more structured heirarchic monotheistic religion. Being away from the Atlantic coast of Nigeria meant that European influence took longer to affect hinterland Igbo lifestyles. It also meant that the area had few settlements of repatriated and freed African slaves who had made their way back to Nigeria from America and Brazil. Called Saros and Agudas respectively, these returnees brought with them new cultural styles and established residential settlements which were influential in the development of coastal towns such as Lagos and Calabar. Similarly, missionary and government enterprise reached the Igbo hinterland much later than the coast, thus Christianity and its cultural influence was felt much later in this area. The text occasionally, however, draws architectural comparisons with other Nigerian regions and other developing countries.",,Uduku O.,10.1016/0197-3975(95)00052-6
153,5.0,2021,Article,Hybrid coordination of city organisations: The rule of people and culture in the shadow of structures,"Under far-reaching reforms, many cities have delegated core tasks previously delivered by their administrations to independent organisations that they formally own, e.g. municipal companies, or supervise, e.g. municipal trust funds. The coordination of these (as we call them) ‘domestic’ city organisations has proven challenging. Extant literature argues that such coordination is achieved through a mix of various hierarchical, market and network mechanisms. Yet it is unclear how these modes are combined. Addressing this gap, we ask: How do governance modes interact in the hybrid coordination of domestic city organisations? Analysing the case of Vienna, where 100 domestic organisations employ about 60,000 people, we find that while cultural mechanisms, rooted in the network mode, are predominant, they unfold in the shadow of latent structural mechanisms, which are associated with hierarchy and market. In the background, structural mechanisms keep cultural coordination effective, while cultural mechanisms allow structural coordination to remain (generally) hidden. This study aims to contribute to the literature on the governance of public organisations by exploring the relationship between governance modes as well as furthering urban governance studies by applying insights from studies on the coordination of public organisations to the city context. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.",(domestic) city organisations; coordination; governance; integration; Vienna,"Leixnering S., Meyer R.E., Polzer T.",10.1177/0042098020963854

159,5.0,2017,Conference Paper,Review on the Traditional Uses and Potential of Totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) as Construction Material,"The recent advances in the wood construction field have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall buildings structures and other constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in CO2eq emissions of the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials like concrete or steel, with wood and biomass-based materials. Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO2eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Hidalgo-Cordero J.F., García-Navarro J.",10.1088/1757-899X/245/2/022068
161,5.0,2016,Conference Paper,Applying social norms to high-fidelity pedestrian and traffic simulations,"Smart cities are founded on complex interactions among architectural and urban designs, sensors, actuators and crowds of people with their devices. In this context, simulation becomes essential to study the effects of the technology and to understand how to improve its effectiveness on the social environment. The majority of the current pedestrian and traffic simulations adopt a bird-eye view and are driven by statistical models. While this is enough in many cases, e.g. to study traffic flow under common conditions assuming average cases, it is not appropriate when a higher level of fidelity is required. Simulated people need to show both a plausible behavior and mechanisms to coordinate with human participants in a natural way. Much of this coordination happens silently and is driven by social norms, that may vary according to culture and context. In this paper, we propose an approach to represent social norms in multi-agent systems that enables implicit coordination driven by observations of others' behaviors. This is applied specifically to the case of pedestrian movement. In order to allow for a more effective participation of humans in the simulation, our approach does not use central coordinators or coordination protocol, but rather each agent takes its own decision so to make more realistic interactions.

Envisioned in 1947 but not completed until the mid-1960s, the arch today attracts millions of tourists annually and is one of the world's most widely recognized structures. By weaving together social, political, and cultural history, historian Tracy Campbell uncovers the complicated and troubling history of the beloved structure. This compelling book explores how a medley of players with widely divergent motivations (civic pride, ambition, greed, among others) brought the Gateway Arch to fruition, but at a price the city continues to pay. Campbell dispels long-held myths and casts a provocative new light on the true origins and meaning of the Gateway Arch. He shows that the monument was the scheme of shrewd city leaders who sought to renew downtown St. Louis and were willing to steal an election, destroy historic buildings, and drive out local people and businesses to achieve their goal. Campbell also tells the human story of the architect Eero Saarinen, whose prize-winning design brought him acclaim but also charges of plagiarism, and who never lived to see the completion of his vision. As a national symbol, the Gateway Arch has a singular place in American culture, Campbell concludes, yet it also stands as an instructive example of failed urban planning. © 2013 by Tracy Campbell.

164,5.0,2010,Article,"Designing affordable housing with cree, anishinabe, and métis people","Three levels of government are investing in the renewal or construction of affordable housing in Manitoba's inner-city areas. Much of this housing is targeted to communities that are predominantly Aboriginal. Little consultation has occurred about the underlying cultural assumptions of the design of these homes. This is in spite of the fact that the layout of a home may significantly direct the life ways of a family or affect their relationships to relatives or neighbours. Lack of consultation has proved problematic in some Indigenous communities, whereas in those few cases where consultation has occurred, the emerging designs have been significantly different from conventional designs. This article describes a four-year process of consultation on cultural concepts in the design of buildings intended for Aboriginal families in urban communities in Manitoba. Participatory design activities drew out numerous themes that, if incorporated into buildings, might help Indigenous families retain or recover their cultural values and lifeways. A number of these Indigenous themes have been incorporated in buildings that have already been constructed. The themes relate not just to the decorative features of the buildings but to conceptual assumptions underlying their design.

Developing Guidelines for Human-centered Outdoor Spaces in China that Citizens Can be Proud of,"Creating livable cities through cultural development is important not only because of the inherent value of culture itself, but also because of the social, economic, and environmental benefits afforded by communities with increased pride and attachment to places and people they share the city with. This is increasingly more critical for children and young people, as educating them to become better citizens, it also do strongly relate with development habits and their awareness of interacting with outdoor environments surrounding them. For inhabitants of cities to live an enriched life in every means, they require more than just the infrastructure and the trappings of material wealth: They require an attachment to a place, a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose, of which, a sound cultural development can help generate. Given the central government's recent emphasis in the 13th 5-year plan on encouraging creative and innovative industries, it is relevant to generate programs on cultural development focusing on younger generations. Through this, municipal governments can improve the quality of life and empower the young generation to shape the long-term prosperity of their cities. What are various ways to develop solutions based on strengthening community relations? What are the dynamics of relationship of people with each other from different social milieu?

172,4.0,2016,Conference Paper,Dilemmas of Identity in Contemporary Cities. the City of Gdansk as an Example,"The article is aimed to answer the question how, depending on the historical heritage, the collective memory, the physical space of the city and their images were shaped, through the politics of memory. All known cultures and languages distinguish the 'self' and the 'other', 'us' and 'them'. Neither do we know cities which wish to differ in some particular way, although they can have numerous identities. Their multitude and diversity may be a source of conflicts or contradictions in a creating their coherent image. From a sociological perspective, all identities are constructed. The real problem, however, is how, with what, by whom, and for what? Although identities are not time-proof, in favourable circumstances, they legitimize and rationalize dominant institutions of authority and culture. The public discourse on memory and identity of the modern Gdansk is dominated by multiparadigmatism, going beyond the authenticity of the material and cultural heritage and the state of knowledge presented by historians.

173,4.0,2014,Article,"Unexplored elasticity of planning and good governance in Harare, Zimbabwe","The state of the city of Harare in terms of its present general outlook and critical analysis of its carrying capacity as a colonial city tends to perpetuate an ingrained myth among urban planners and the common people alike that planning has failed the former so called sunshine-city. Yet such a view treats with amnesia the wealth in the elasticity of planning as an instrument for change as well as a strategic force to command and direct the trajectory of cities. It is in this context that this paper discusses the elasticity of planning of Harare as anchored on a complex but well-knit constellation of the factors of good urban governance and political will. These can allow for urban reform and smart transformation. A close look at the city after 1980 shows that the city of Harare has been subjected to much bickering, contestations and intergovernmental impositions of policy hence it exemplifies policy from above as opposed to policy from below. This is largely explained by the central government's hard and fast wrenching control in directing the affairs of the city hence negating the role of the residents' needs and wants. Recently the city has been facing several challenges, more than ever before, and the more critical challenge now is the adopted culture of colonial blaming rather that solving the deep seated problems of poor management approaches. The present study is skewed towards assessing the historical and contemporary socio-economic and political dynamics as far as they have inspired, championed, ignored, and arm-twisted planning. This has largely been to the detriment of the city. Thus, a vortex and maelstrom over the relevance of planning has been created which now requires planning to exonerate itself by proving its worthiness to the citizens and investors whose creeds and needs it has betrayed over the years. © SPSD Press from 2010, SPSD Press, Kanazawa.",Colonialism; Elasticity; Governance; Spatial planning,"Chirisa I., Kawadza S.T., Muzenda A.",10.14246/irspsd.2.4_19
174,4.0,2012,Article,Diversity and thermal comfort in outdoor places,"Sustainable cities should be livable cities where people from different backgrounds and with different aspirations can meet and interact with each other. Public places being the urban stages where the social interactions happen are considered important parts of cities (Thompson, 2002; Varna, 2009). They can contribute to enhance the quality of life within cities, or contrarily increase isolation and social exclusion (Lo et al., 2003). As a consequence of globalization and the development of global cities, the level of international migration has been growing in the last decades creating a plurality of different cultures in global cities and inspiring in such cities a multicultural nature (O'Byrne, 1997; Short and Kim, 1999; Hawkins, 2006). This created new challenges in urban planning or the management of the coexistence of different people that are having different characteristics that shape their unique identity and needs in the shared spaces (Sandercock, 2004). Ideally, in order to invite a diversity of users, urban outdoor places should provide significant functional and physical qualities, and accessibility to them, which induce the fulfillment of physiological, psychological and social needs (Carr et al., 1992; Jacobs, 1993; Sandholz, 2007). Users' state of comfort as stated by researchers gives a good indication for how successful is the public outdoor places (Rosheidat et al., 2008; Kwong et al., 2009; Aljawabra and Nikolopoulou, 2010). In order to create a successful open space usable by all members of a community, urban designers need to satisfy their comfort needs in its wider meaning according to a variety of different ages, genders and cultural backgrounds (Knez and Thorsson, 2006; Thorsson et al., 2007).

177,4.0,2005,Article,The socio-cultural dimension of housing: Quality in Osogbo Nigeria,"House-form has played a significant role in the socio-cultural adaptation of most people and societies in Nigeria. Specifically, within the Yoruba ethnic group of south-western part of Nigeria. To them, the house represents a status symbol, which every member of a particular family identifies with. The pattern and form of such dwelling have played vital role in shaping and influencing the lifestyle of the people. The house to them is a place for moral and social formation as well as for physical and psychology reformation. Unfortunately, the effect and infusion of western cultural contact through civilization, technological advancement and the unfolding world order of globalization on majority of African societies and people have created loss of originality in housing forms and patterns as well as loss of cultural values of the people. This paper, which emanated from a previous resear ch by the Authors, intends to evaluate the significance of house- forms on housing quality as well as on the lifestyle of the Nigeria people. Osogbo, a traditional as well as an urbanized township was used as case study. (The findings of the research are representative of the Housing situation in most Nigerian societies). The study, which identified three (3) zones of res idential and urban development revealed a significant relationship between House-form and Housing quality within the residential districts of Osogbo. It also affirmed the predominance of the Yoruba ethnic origin over other ethnic origins in Osogbo. The paper submitted that any housing planning and de velopment that ignores the relevant socio-cultural forms and patterns would invariably lack originality and relevance to the target population. It, therefore, recommends that Government, housing planners and developers should take house-form of the different sub-cultures into consideration before embarking on future housing development.

178,3.0,2019,Article,Suggesting theoretical urban neighborhood design concept by adopting the changing discourse of social capital,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review, analyze and synthesize different pieces from literature to explore, define and describe the concept of social capital and its relationships with urban neighborhood design concepts. Additionally, to define the indicators and principles that can enhance social capital within urban design context. Moreover, to suggest theoretical urban neighborhood design concept that can adopt the changing discourse of social capital. Design/methodology/approach: This research used the theoretical, analytical and descriptive approach-driven case study method. In all, 29 papers were analyzed to conclude the indicators that can measure social capital within the urban neighborhood design context and to conclude the required neighborhood design features and principles that influence social capital. Additionally, two new urban neighborhoods design concepts, cohousing and hybrid concepts that adopt new forms of social interaction, were studied, analyzed and then synthesized to suggest new neighborhood design concept, which is a heterotopia concept. Findings: Heterotopia neighborhood concept aims to create real, different and heterogeneous functional spaces with different layers of meanings for people from different cultures in one place. Different visible enclosures are merged into spaces of otherness while the diversity gives a sense of entering another alternative place. The heterotopias neighborhood design principles aim to create a wide variety of forms, shapes and elements [different new spaces for different ritual activities to reflect the otherness self-reflection (homogeneous and scattered spaces)] and create linkage, hierarchy, contrast and mingling between spaces and places; well-defined functional effective spaces; different fantasy and leisure spaces; high standard quality of life and otherness space; flux in social realm and fluidity of spaces; mixed use and joint experience; and innovated technologies spaces to offer strange new temporalities. Research limitations/implications: This research recommended that different community stakeholders should participate in planning process, neighborhood urban design and decision-making process about public spaces to strengthen the community ties and achieve a heterotopia concept. Architect, urban designers and planners should adopt bottom-up design approach when designing neighborhood. Additionally, to avoid poor social capital research studies, the new researchers, practitioners and journal reviewers approaching social capital for the first time must read widely to gain an understanding of the concept from different perspectives and narrow their scope to their particular area of interest. Practical implications: This research highlights the needs for empirical studies to examine the relationships/interrelationships between all neighborhood design principles and social capital. This might increase the knowledge on how we can design and increase the quality of neighborhood to foster social capital, which might offer interesting insights into how neighborhood urban design principles are combined to foster social capital within neighborhood context. Originality/value: Neighborhood-based research encourages new suggesting concepts in designing every single place in the residential neighborhood in a way that can adapt the new forms of social interaction. This research scanned the current concepts of neighborhood design that concerned successfully with the changing forms of social relationships to conclude some design features and principles for neighborhood design to ensure and promote social public health and well-being. This research offers a unique perspective for better understanding the relationships between the neighborhood urban design as a spatial dimension and social capital. This research aims to enrich the socio-spatial knowledge and build a resilient urban community by suggesting theoretical urban neighborhood design concept, which is the heterotopia concept, and providing the urban designers and architects with a valuable thinking tool to design spaces. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cohousing; Heterotopia spaces; Hybrid spaces; Neighborhood design; Social capital,"Alhusban S.A., Alhusban A.A., AlBetawi Y.N.",10.1108/JEC-09-2018-0064

There are many issues related to the integration and dialogue between cultures. Urban design plays a key role in how migrants participate in their host community and it is an important driver for the inclusion process. Facilitating the participation of residents in designing public spaces and their use helps to create a better sense of belonging. Promoting in public spaces the interaction of different cultures becomes a crucial element to facilitate social cohesion and living together. The research project explores an innovative approach in the use of public spaces, through the design of smart urban furniture. Based on a survey of the user’s needs, and on co-design activities, the project investigates innovative solutions for facilitating migrants’ integration and the dialogue between different cultures, through the design of innovative urban furniture, with smart technologies embodied inside. The project, based on the co-design approach of rapid prototyping, creates different kinds of new interaction among urban space and people, and between users of different social or cultural background.

Courtney Elizabeth Knapp chronicles the politics of gentrification and culture-based development in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by tracing the roots of racism, spatial segregation, and mainstream ""cosmopolitanism"" back to the earliest encounters between the Cherokee, African Americans, and white settlers. For more than three centuries, Chattanooga has been a site for multiracial interaction and community building; yet today public leaders have simultaneously restricted and appropriated many contributions of working-class communities of color within the city, exacerbating inequality and distrust between neighbors and public officials. Knapp suggests that ""diasporic placemaking""-defined as the everyday practices through which uprooted people create new communities of security and belonging-is a useful analytical frame for understanding how multiracial interactions drive planning and urban development in diverse cities over time. By weaving together archival, ethnographic, and participatory action research techniques, she reveals the political complexities of a city characterized by centuries of ordinary resistance to racial segregation and uneven geographic development. © 2018 The University of North Carolina Press.

182,3.0,2017,Article,An integral lens on Patrick Geddes,"Patrick Geddes is a significant figure in the landscape and urban planning canon. In addition to situating cities within a regional context and advancing a socioecological understanding of urbanization, he viewed cities as the principal artifact of, and theater wherein, human culture evolves. This expansive view of cities may be one of the more challenging aspects of Geddes’ legacy to assimilate. Working during a late 19th and early 20th century period when the limitations of modernity were becoming increasingly apparent, much of Geddes’ aspirational thinking can be seen as an effort to create what he described as a “larger modernism.” In this regard, Geddes can be counted amongst those whom we portray as integrative holistic thinkers, people whose worldview draws them toward meaning-making narratives and frameworks that include the many dimensions of the human condition. Today, a new generation of holistic approaches called “metatheories” – and “integral theory” in particular – provides an orienting lens through which to review, assess, and potentially extend the work of Geddes in the 21st century. Towards that goal, this article first provides an introductory primer to some of Geddes’ noteworthy “thinking machines” as well as integral theory. We then assess correspondence between the two, focusing on Interdisciplinary Holism; Evolution, Development and Complex Systems; Human Agency and Ethics; and Spirituality. A closing discussion addresses prospects for future research, and suggests that the holistic, evolutionary, and generative orientation of our principal subjects may have particular relevance in an anthropogenic biosphere characterized, in part, by significant environmental challenges and the concentration of humans in cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Anthropocene; Anthropogenic biosphere; Cities; Integral theory; Landscape and urban planning; Metatheories; Patrick Geddes; Sociocultural evolution; Socioecological planning; Urbanization,"Eisenman T.S., Murray T.",10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.011

Nowadays, humanity faces a multidimensional crisis, socio-economic crisis, cultural crisis, which is directly related to the environmental one. In the last few decades, the current development model has been questioned by international organizations and scientists of various specializations. Sustainable development or ecodevelopment approaching interdisciplinary the problem explores the exit from the socio-economic and environmental crisis. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively examine the contents of ecodevelopment and to express it in simple words, so as to be understood by people. In particular, it aims to review and clarify the concept of eco-development, defining its content in its entirety, considering it together with the role of spatial planning (regional and urban) and suggesting methods of organization of society, to provide better quality of life and achieve the exit from the crisis. A need to create a new model based on the concept of ecosystem arises from the research, where the laws of nature and culture of each place will be seriously considered in formulating development policy. A key-element for ecological spatial planning is the carrying capacity of ecosystems. The aim of spatial planning appears to be the sustainability of natural systems in order to be able to sustain and supply the anthropogenic systems, meeting the 'real' human needs. For the implementation of these and the exit from the crisis of utmost importance the role of education is highlighted in creating active citizens, who are required to undertake, through self-organization [1, 2], to promote eco-development and eco-design. © 2017 PSP.","Eco-development; Environment; Spatial planning (regional, urban)",Lantitsou K.I.,
185,3.0,2016,Article,"Urban survey and planning in twentieth-century Japan: Wajiro Kon's ""Modernology"" and its descendants","Since the nineteenth century, the survey of people's way of life were the basic method to study big cities. Even though the surveys were motivated by social awareness, the result was mainly analyzed by scientific, political and economical interests, and often was devided from the cultural and psychological research of urban phenomena. However, as it is obvious that these are closely integrated, the method and idea of the urban survey reflect the bilateral relationship between perceiving and conceiving urban space. This study will explain how urban surveys transformed and reflected the ideas and interests in urban space and its study in Japan from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1980s. Especially in examining a research named ""Modernology"" by a Japanese architect Wajiro Kon from 1925 to 1930, and the works of later Japanese architects inspiered by ""Modernology"" after 1960s, this study will explain how they tried to create urban studies with cultural identity by conducting surveys and integrating with international theories. ""Modernology""described the emerging urban space and people's way of life in Tokyo, and was often recognized as a method of popular culture. However, Modernology represented critical aspects of social space and encouraged people to be more engaged with it. While modernist architects distanced from urban realities to solve its problems scientifically, Modernology was often recognized as their counter part. When we recognize its primal objectives and influence on later generation in seeking the social ethos in the dialectical progress with the bilateral approaches between surveying and planning, we can understand the alternative aspect of Japanese urban studies. ©The Author(s) 2016.",anthropology; Christopher Alexander; Design Survey; everyday phenomena; fashion; idea of urban space; Konpeito and Iryuhin Kenkyujo; lifestyle; marketing theory; Modernology; Patrick Geddes; social survey; Street Observation Society; Tokyo; visual description; Wajiro Kon,Kuroishi I.,10.1177/0096144216635151
186,3.0,2016,Book,Geo-architecture and landscape in China’s geographic and historic context: Volume 4 symbolism and the language of geo-architecture,"This book approaches the concept of geo-architecture by analyzing the symbolic characters of architectures. It proves that the relationship between architecture and geography is not merely an embodiment of physical and functional demands but rather a formal expression of the materialization of culture. After analyzing the vast number of villages, groups of buildings and individual buildings the forms of which closely resemble the forms of the Bagua (symbol of the Eight Trigrams), Taichi, animals and plants, this book finds that this kind of symbolism creatively places living and working places within the natural geographic environment and, by seeking a relationship between architecture and its surrounding environment, comes to express people’s hopes and dreams, evolving slowly to take on certain cultural connotations. This book is the fourth of a 4-volume book series. The series develops the innovative concept of “geo-architecture” by exploring the myriad influences of natural, human and historical factors upon architecture. These influences are considered in three categories, namely, interaction between architecture and nature, interaction between architecture and its human users and change in architecture over time--each category serves as a lens. Augmenting these lenses is the Time-Person-Place concept applied different geographic. The analysis ultimately focuses on two aspects: geographic influence on architecture and architectural response to geography. The over 1000 pictures of case architectures enriches the study with stunning and unique visual angles. ""This unprecedented work will be a unique and valuable contribution to the literature.

The controls from the state and other pertinent forces led to the actual outcomes of political-economic ambitions and spatial policy rhetoric. It was an inherent feature of the society and economy to go outside of the state's controls, and the unintended consequences were unavoidable.

Accessible and open to everyone, they are designed for a variety of uses where people can participate in public life. They also contribute to the collective identity of the community as they represent the culture and values of its users. In recent decades, the different ways in which public spaces are used have been the subject of studies from different disciplines including but not limited to anthropology, geography, sociology, architecture, and urban planning. It has been argued that the way in which urban life is lived and experienced changes according to demographics of its users such as age, sex, and social class.In this study, the use of public spaces based on gender differences is analyzed using space syntax methodology. The context of the study is the city center of a small Anatolian town, Balikesir, which is located in western Turkey. The methodology of the study includes a visibility analysis of the historic city center and pedestrian movement observations on the selected locations within this center. The results indicate that male users dominate the city center at all times while the density of women users is much lower, and is even lower than that of teenagers. A major contribution of this study is the finding that there is a discrepancy between the most integrated streets in terms of visibility and the most densely used ones. Given that the users of this small Anatolian town are mostly its residents, this finding suggests that for route-choice decisions,pedestrians utilize prior knowledge and experience of the city center more than the visual information provided to them via the geometry of the space. © 2014, Istanbul Teknik Universitesi, Faculty of Architecture.

The factors that support this point of view are: 1) the ubiquity of the high rise and new town way of life; 2) a shared value system and culture within the new towns that is shaped by and reflected in the architecture and planning of the new towns; 3) the importance of relationships between spaces in the new towns; 4) the ability of the architecture and planning of new towns to adapt to changes within Singaporean society; 5) the acceptance, legitimacy, and identification of the high-rise way of life by Singaporeans.

195,3.0,1987,Article,The study of urban history in the People’s Republic of China,"Since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, most of the topics associated with the study of urban history have languished largely unstudied beneath a pall of ideologically based neglect. The list of understudied subjects includes urban population, physical structure, social structure, economic activity, urban politics, urban planning and the environment, and urban culture. This lack of interest in urban history directly reflects the emphasis on the role of the peasantry as a creative force in Chinese history. The history of Chinese peasant uprisings and wars became the focus of attention and left little interest for what changes might have taken place in urban settings. Today, a combination of forces has generated considerable changes in the institutional structure of historical studies in China, as well as compelling historians to reconsider established research preferences. In this atmosphere it appears that for the first time since 1949 topics that concern urban historians in the West and Japan are receiving serious attention in the People’s Republic of China.

196,2.0,2021,Article,Using decision support system to enable crowd identify neighborhood issues and its solutions for policy makers: An online experiment at kabul municipal level,"Planning a city is a systematic process that includes time, space, and groups of people who must communicate. However, due to security problems in such war-ravaged countries as Afghanistan, the traditional forms of public participation in the planning process are untenable. In particular, due to gathering space difficulties and culture issues in Afghanistan, women and religious minorities are restricted from joining male-dominated powerholders’ face-to-face meetings which are nearly always held in fixed places called masjids (religious buildings). Furthermore, conducting such discussions with human facilitation biases the generation of citizen decisions that stimulates an atmosphere of confrontation, causing another decision problem for urban policy-making institutions. Therefore, it is critical to find approaches that not only securely revolutionize participative processes but also provide meaningful and equal public consultation to support interactions among stakehold-ers to solve their shared problems together. Toward this end, we propose a joint research program, namely, crowd-based communicative and deliberative e-planning (CCDP), a blended approach, which is a mixture of using an artificial-intelligence-led technology, decision-support system called D-Agree and experimental participatory planning in Kabul, Afghanistan. For the sake of real-world implementation, Nagoya Institute of Technology (Japan) and Kabul Municipality (Afghanistan) have formed a novel developed and developing world partnership by using our proposed methodology as an emerging-deliberation mechanism to reframe public participation in urban planning processes. In the proposed program, Kabul municipality agreed to use our methodology when Kabul city needs to make a plan with people. This digital field study presents the first practical example of using online decision support systems in the context of the neighborhood functions of Gozars, which are Kabul’s social and spatial urban units. The main objective was to harness the wisdom of the crowd to innovative suggestions for helping policymakers making strategic development plans for Gozars using open call ideas, and for responding to equal participation and consultation needs, specifically for women and minorities. This article presents valuable insights into the benefits of this combined approach as blended experience for societies and cities that are suffering long-term distress.

This study aimed to evaluate the range of positions held by urban forest managers from local governments in the state of Victoria, Australia, regarding the management and governance challenges that affect their decision-making. This study was based on a Q-method approach, a procedure that allows researchers to evaluate the range of positions that exist about a topic in a structured manner based on the experiences of a wide group of people. We created statements on a wide range of urban forest management and governance challenges and asked urban forest managers to rate their level of agreement with these statements via an online survey. Managers generally agreed about the challenges posed by urban development and climate change for implementing local government policies on urban forest protection and expansion. However, there were divergent views about how effective solutions based on increasing operational capacities, such as increasing budgets and personnel, could address these challenges. For some managers, it was more effective to improve critical governance challenges, such as inter-departmental and inter-municipal coordination, community engagement, and addressing the culture of risk aversion in local governments. Urban forest regional strategies aimed at coordinating management and governance issues across cities should build on existing consensus on development and environmental threats and address critical management and governance issues not solely related to local government operational capacity. © 2020 by the authors.",Ecosystem management; Municipal government; Nature-based solutions; Q-method; Urban forest governance; Urban planning,"Ordóñez C., Kendal D., Threlfall C.G., Hochuli D.F., Davern M., Fuller R.A., van der Ree R., Livesley S.J.",10.3390/f11090963

In this paper, we discuss the physical and historic centre of Cluj-Napoca, the place that exhibits distinctive structural and functional features and which, throughout history, was shaped and adapted to different ages and needs. As a result, it is the most refined and monumental cultural landscape, granting the city a strong identity and a space rich in cultural significances. Analysing the cultural landscape of these spaces from a past, present and future perspective, it is necessary to emphasise the link between the users' perception of the city centre and the ""cold demarcation"", through official urban planning, based mainly on quantitative data and on urban indicators (e.g. consistency of the built space, buildings height, proportion between inhabited space and the organised one, accessibility, urban connectivity, etc.). Quite a lot of times, urban planning ignores users' perceptions, being focused on businesses and ensuring people's daily needs and not necessarily on preserving or creating symbolic places, which inhabitants are attached to and where they feel ""at home"". Therefore, our aim is to highlight the cultural significance of the public spaces within the city centre of Cluj-Napoca and to assess users' perceptions of these places more and more altered and affected by globalisation spaces. We used the results of two questionnaire surveys and of an extensive research on the history and present features of these spaces. The first survey consisted of 150 filled-in questionnaires designed to set the perceived limits of Cluj-Napoca central area and, the second one, with 300 filled-in questionnaires, aimed to establish the inhabitants' perceptions of the public squares' aesthetics and functionality. Many cities are part of or head towards the so-called cultural vacuum, mainly a result of a profound globalisation and of interpreting culture itself in a wrong way. One more reason for such research approaches to be welcomed and up to date. © 2020 Austrian Geographical Society.

201,2.0,2020,Article,Post-pandemic city: Historical context for new urban design,"Cities have been almost completely unpre-pared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Urban history has known many epidemics and pandemics, and there are clear historical parallels between the 13th and 19th century plague pandemics and cholera epidemics and the 21th century COVID-19 pandem-ic, from an administrative point of view. However, the cities’ public administration did not take into account the experience of the cities of the past to be prepared for the future problems. This requires developing flexible pandemic strategies and focus-ing on the decentralization of urban space through an even distribution of population in the urban en-vironment. The COVID-19 pandemic will change the city, as previous pandemics and epidemics did. Urban-ism v.3.0. will emerge, combining a green vector of development and digital technologies to ensure the autonomy and sustainability of buildings, dis-tricts and cities. At the same time, the role of culture will increase, which will become an effective tool for consolidating the soft power of the city in order to attract new people as the opposition of nowadays trend for living in the countryside. © 2020, Babes-Bolyai University.

203,2.0,2020,Conference Paper,Landscape Parks in China: Steering and Handling Growing Tourism,"Chinese ways of organizing and exploiting landscape park areas, particularly those of historical importance are specific, due to the contemporary overexploitation of these sites. Historic landscape Park of Quin Shi Huang, contains the world-famous “Terracotta Army”. Such a tourist attraction demands organization of access and traffic on an archaeological site and throughout the immense landscape park. The administration of Panjin Park in the Liaoning Province acts to extend the tourist season beyond August/September, when Suaeda Salsa is in bloom and the “Red Beach” attracts millions of visitors. The ideas of spreading tourist goals beyond icons of nature and history and directing them towards rural culture are the most challenging. Eco-farmsteads with animals and traditional crops from orchards, vegetable plots and fields are viewed as an attraction by people who never experienced village life.

206,2.0,2018,Article,Mental map of the city: Elements of visual argumentation and creativity in modern city planning [Miesto mentalinis žemėlapis: Vizualinio argumentavimo elementai ir kūrybiškumas šiuolaikinio miesto planavimo procese],"Lewis Mumford in The City in History (first edition in 1961) emphasises that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in Western society. Urban planning should concentrate on an organic relationship between people and their living spaces. The city is a product of Earth, a fact of nature, man’s method of expression, Mumford writes in his The Culture of Cities (first edition in 1938). This also means that both the designer and the user must have a high degree of creativity in order to design and utilise the built environment. By analysing the definition of the city Mumford examines its changes during history from ancient times to recent planning method. He criticises the most dominant design processes of the 20th century: the functionalist and mechanical urban design. He is an advocate of the organic method in planning and understanding cities. The organic approach requires an active and creative approach as opposed to mere passive reception. This organic approach by Mumford to understanding cities is based on the theory of Kevin A. Lynch. We may distinguish 3 normative ways of city planning theory: (1) the cosmic, (2) the mechanic and (3) the organic model. In my paper I will first apply the onion model of culture developed by Geert Hofstede for the city and its analysis, and also for the appearance of creativity in them. After that I am going to examine the city with a special, architectural based mind map theory: the five elements by Lynch. Lynch suggests that these five elements (paths, edges, districts, nodes, landmarks) create the mental map for readability. Finally, I will investigate a usage of mental map in modern city planning (Le Corbusier) and works on the process of “debabelisation” (Otto Neurath). © 2018 The Author(s).",City planning; Creativity; Hofstede; Lynch; Mental map; Urban design; Visual argumentation,Jász B.,10.3846/cs.2018.6901
207,2.0,2018,Book Chapter,Sustainable social innovations in smart cities: Exploratory analysis of the current global situation applicable to Colombia,"In the current world most of the population is concentrated in urban areas, where people receive their education, work and leisure activities. Therefore, many challenges have appeared in cities all over the world related to growth, over- population, urban planning, quality of services, competitiveness, environmental factors and citizenship values, which have become main priorities of the managers and mayors of these cities. The Smart City concept emerges as a paradigm that aims to solve these problems and challenges, by developing policies, infrastructure, ser- vices and public awareness programs that will transform today cities, for example a future self-sustaining innovation, growth, technological development, civic and ethical citizenship and social progress. This study presents an exploratory analysis in respect of the current global situation related to the concept of Smart City, com- paring the different essential definitions and dimensions described in recent litera- ture by cited authors and related to the nomenclature of the term. The effects, challenges and opportunities that Smart Cities can offer to their citizens, has been presented, for example in different programs, projects and initiatives, that cities all over the world have implemented, focusing on sustainable social innovations, eco- nomic growth, environmental protection, quality of life, participatory governance, social and community development, citizenship education, efficient urban mobility, tourism services, health and safety. The situation in Bogota and Medellin, the two main cities of Colombia have been reviewed and studied in this work, the aspects previously mentioned have been taken into account to establish a new definition of the Smart City concept. To perform this task, a set of six dimensions and 27 subcat- egories are essential to define and measure this concept in the Colombian paradigm, which can be used to monitor the current status, in order to approximate evaluations of Colombian cities to the qualification concept described as the Smart City. Due to the lack of studies observed in this work, further research must be focused, not only on getting more data from Bogota and Medellin, but also having the opportunity to observe the situation in other important cities such as Barranquilla, Cali, Bucaramanga or Cartagena, currently no data is available. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

208,2.0,2018,Conference Paper,The Development of a Web-Based Urban Soundscape Evaluation System,"Acoustic quality is one of the important aspects of urban design. It is usually evaluated based on how loud the urban environment is. However, this approach does not consider people's perception of the urban acoustic environment. Therefore, a different method has been developed based on the perception of the acoustic environment using the concept of soundscape. Soundscape is defined as the acoustic environment perceived by people who are part of the environment. This approach considers the relationship between the sound source, the environment, and the people. The analysis of soundscape considers many aspects such as cultural aspects, people's expectations, people's experience of space, and social aspects. Soundscape affects many aspects of human life such as culture, health, and the quality of life. Urban soundscape management and planning must be integrated with the other aspect of urban design, both in the design and the improvement stages. The soundscape concept seeks to make the acoustic environment as pleasant as possible in a space with or without uncomfortable sound sources. Soundscape planning includes the design of physical features to achieve a positive perceptual outcome. It is vital to gather data regarding the relationship between humans and the components of a soundscape, e.g., sound sources, features of the physical environment, the functions of a space, and the expectation of the sound source. The data can be measured and gathered using several soundscape evaluation methods. Soundscape evaluation is usually conducted using in-situ surveys and laboratory experiments using a multi-speaker system. Although these methods have been validated and are widely used in soundscape analysis, there are some limitations in the application. The in-situ survey needs to be done at one time with many people at the same time because it is hard to replicate the acoustic environment. Conversely, the laboratory experiment does not have a problem with the repetition of the experiment. This method requires a room with a multi-speaker reproduction system. This project used a different method to analyse soundscape developed using headphones via the internet. The internet system for data gathering has been established; a website has enabled to reproduce high-quality audio and it has a system to design online questionnaires. Furthermore, the development of a virtual reality system allows the reproduction of virtual audio-visual stimulus on a website. Although the website has an established system to gather the required data, the problem is the validation of the reproduction system for soundscape analysis, which needs to be done with consideration of several factors: the suitable recording system, the effect of headphone variation, the calibration of the system, and the perception result from internet-based acoustic environment reproduction. This study aims to develop and validate a web-based urban soundscape evaluation method. By using this method, the experiment can be repeated easily and data can be gathered from many respondents. Furthermore, the simplicity of the system allows for the application by the stakeholders in urban design. The data gathered from this system is important for the design of an urban area with consideration of the acoustic aspects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Sudarsono A.S., Sarwono J.",10.1088/1755-1315/158/1/012052
209,2.0,2018,Article,'Auraldiversity': Defining a hearing- centred perspective to socially equitable design of the built environment,"Historically, sound, soundscape and human hearing have collectively received litt le att ention in the design of urban spaces and places, particularly with regards to the psychological and sociological impact of hearing on the experience of individuals in the built environment. It is proposed that the sonic considerations which have been made in urban design are commonly developed within an assumption of otologically normal hearing, and, more broadly, without the acknowledgement of the actual diversity in people's auditory and sensory abilities. Existing considerations of sound and hearing within inclusive design research, particularly in the built environment, are grounded in an 'auraltypical' perspective where the primary focus is hearing individuals or those with hearing loss. This position supposes to some degree that an idealized otological profi le and consistent model of hearing profi ciency is shared amongst all citizens and engenders a culture of urban design driven by 'good/bad' ears and homogenized sonic interaction. This paper introduces the theoretical paradigm of 'auraldiversity' - an emerging agenda that acknowledges the diversity of human hearing and the multitude of elements that place the hearing modality within a state of constant fl ux. The paper situates this theoretical perspective within the context of the built environment through the mapping of three 'auraldivergent' hearing profi les. Each profi le charts the lived sonic experiences of a d/Deaf or disabled individual in the built environment. The paper concludes by positioning the auraldiversity paradigm as a catalyst in the development of a hearing-centred approach to inclusive design research, a new agenda where the opportunity for more socially and sonically equitable design of the built environment is established. © 2018 Ingenta.",,Renel W.,10.2148/benv.44.1.36
213,2.0,2016,Article,Lewis Mumford's Urbanism and the Problem of Environmental Modernity,"This essay reconsiders the early career of Lewis Mumford and the assumption that modernity has been disastrous environmentally. Might it be possible to see Mumford, especially in his writings of the 1930s, as an early exemplar of green urbanism? Within environmental history, Mumford has been treated mostly as a regionalist - sometimes even as an opponent of the city. This essay argues that in fact his path toward ecological ""balance"" led directly through the city, not out of it. Indeed, he gives us access to modernity's ambivalence and complexity by accompanying his trenchant critique of modern cities with a positive vision for how people might design and occupy urban spaces more sustainably. To rediscover Mumford is to reconsider the city not just as a site of erasure and hubristic ""renewal"" but also as a landscape full of what he called ""remnants"" and ""persistents""; it is to rediscover modernity's environmental possibilities, in line with current trends in urban ecology and design, and with the new momentum in urban environmental history to combine material and cultural perspectives. © 2016 The Author.",,Sachs A.,10.1093/envhis/emw034
216,2.0,2015,Article,The meaning of centrality and margin in Lisbon’s Rossio: Spatializing urban processes before and after the 1755 earthquake1,"Praça do Rossio has been the most emblematic space in central Lisbon both before and after the 1755 earthquake that destroyed much of the city. Up until the thirteenth century Rossio was a barren area outside the walls of the medieval city and was used as a common space where people held ceremonies for 500 years. The Rossio also connected inland rural area with the city within the walls, acting as a bridge between those two worlds. For this reason Rossio has always been a space for all kind of vendors, outsiders, beggars and social rejects, while also a route into the city for agrarian culture, rituals and people. Despite the attempts by the city’s masters and the Crown to seize the space for the construction of their institutions, it was not until the 1755 earthquake that this finally happened. The reconstruction of Lisbon under the gaze of the enlightened rationalist Marquis of Pombal represented the beginning of a new era for the city: giving birth to the modern bourgeois city, in which the historical organization of space was reshaped, the Rossio’s traditional functions displaced and the meaning and contents of the hegemonic city representations and imaginaries such as fado music and the annual People’s Saints (Santos Populares) celebrations renewed. In this article, the centrality of Rossio is reviewed, with a stress on the displacement of some of its attributes to the districts after the earthquake by the romantic heritage processes of meaning. However, the Rossio maintained some of its traditional functions, with the daily presence there of African migrants as an example. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Dossier.",1755 earthquake; Heritage; Lisbon; Praça do Rossio; Urban planning; Urban processes,Malet Calvo D.,10.1386/pjss.14.2.123_1
217,2.0,2015,Article,"Swettenham pier waterfront redevelopment, Penang","A waterfront is a place where life of a city bloomed. Water is the source of life. Life is the practice of living. A waterfront signified a city's growth, bounded by water. Swettenham Pier is one part of Penang Island's east coast waterfront link, and happened to be at the sport where Georgetown started. The spot where in history, Sir Francis Light landed on this island and where Georgetown is established along with the blooming of international entrepot activities. It was glorious back in the late 80's. The main objective of this thesis is to bring back the glory moment of Swettenham Pier, giving back the waterfront to the people of Georgetown, people of Penang. Having to attend to this said aim, the redevelopment of Swettenham Pier waterfront is to give a chance to the people to claim a part of this waterfront, for living, for leisure or for any unplanned activities, as to establish its aim to contribute back to the local people, local culture and local living. This call for a strategy to design a waterfront to revive the history, while injecting new life to the place for people and activities to be carry on care freely. The design potential of this project is to look through the entire master plan of the waterfront and then move into the micro elements that support the entire scheme. The master plan plays a crucial role in supporting the waterfront with various types of activities that serve various demographics of users. The redevelopment of the new cruise terminal would also be explored thoroughly in conjunction with Penang Structure Plan in order to come out with the design that could cope with future development. One of the key outcomes of this research is that community magnet or a civic component inserted in the scheme will contribute back to the local people and culture. © 2015 AENSI Publisher All rights reserved.",Public spaces/function plaza; Redevelopment; Revitalize; Socio-cultural; Tourist destination area; Urban design characteristics; Waterfront; Waterfront development,"Teoh Tong M., Ismail S., Yusoff S.Y., Utaberta N., Yunos M.Y.M., Ismail N.A.",
218,2.0,2015,Article,Planned to be reclaimed: Public design strategies for spontaneous practices of spatial appropriation,"Several contemporary studies on public space focus on its loss, in relation to an increase in people's disengagement from these types of spaces. Since the 1960s, a considerable part of urban culture has attempted to develop strategies for people to re-appropriate public space and to 'inhabit the city again.' This has defined a line of research that, although now consolidated, is still little known in its complexity. In the effort to create a unified framework for the different attempts through which architecture has historically responded to the rise of spontaneous forms of urban creativity, this paper outlines a short history of design strategies aimed at enabling and encouraging different forms of spatial appropriation. It also highlights a gradual shift from prescriptive and repeatable rules to site-specific approaches, prompting a new disciplinary convergence between urban planning and design, interior architecture, industrial design and public art. © Authors and Editors - Lisbon, November 2015.",Interior architecture; Public spaces; Spatial appropriation; Urban design,Leveratto J.,
219,2.0,2014,Article,From ecology landscape to construction of rural aesthetic spaces,"On the surface, rural aesthetic spaces are not considered practical or utilitarian. However, mapping them out is valuable, because permanently sustainable development is the essence of the relationship between man and land. In the early agrarian age, the layout of rural areas was guided by people's aesthetic views of ecology rather than modern precise statistics, calculations, and related design principles. The inherited philosophy of respecting the natural landscape is the original driving force for preserving aesthetic spaces. Ancient feng shui landforms should be preserved in China. These non-utilitarian elements carried villagers' natural aesthetic philosophy across generations and captured the meaning of continuous development of the man-land relationship. At present, rural research focuses on the economics of land use. Research on the ecological landscape construction of rural aesthetic spaces is limited, and this needs to be investigated as an important topic in the field. As rural landscapes evolve, human agricultural activities leave an imprint on the aesthetics of ecological spaces, and modern layout patterns result in an inversion of the rural landscape. In recent years, the destruction of the regional geographical structure by the rapid development of modern urbanization has been devastating.My research aims to analyze rural ecological landscapes and aesthetic spaces corresponding to the elements, and how aesthetic spaces are constructed based on geographical frames. I will carry out a multi-scale study of morphological characteristics, landscape space, and the relationship between evolution patterns and response mechanisms. In large-scale landscape areas, preserving the spatial relationship between villages and geographic landscapes is particularly essential if villages are to inherit cultural and historical traditions. Town regions are medium-scale landscape areas. Based on the investigation of geographic elements such as mountain ranges and water systems, the principle of ecological art composition requires villages and fields to consider distribution contrast and plan the height, scale, and density of rural construction, road linearity and strength, and other urban construction indexes from the perspective of ecological aesthetics. Small-scale areas usually adopt aesthetic space composition with architectural design methods, which should consider natural aesthetic philosophy, interior and exterior spaces, and rural social factors. The combination of geography and urban planning that shapes spaces and the connotation of space far exceeds social relationships when determining the development scale and construction layout of rural areas. The priority is to maintain harmony in the social space. The construction of rural aesthetic space operates through the ""hardware"" of the geographical landscape and the ""software"" of cultural inheritance and accumulation with respect to landscape forms, mechanisms, functional structures, and so on. Rural landscape planning must use geography as its basic space structure, base itself on regional geographical space analysis and landscape preservation, and place importance on indexes of preservation of the regional landscape and traditional culture. It should be specified that the requirements of landscape optimization and socioeconomic development are embedded in the requirements of ecological civilization and social development in the layout of landscape space. These elements form a landscape network that can maintain the comprehensive environment. The philosophy of landscape aesthetics should be expanded to broader spaces in order to introduce the concept of landscape beauty to towns, villages, and even farmlands. © 2014, Ecological Society of China.

This research with excluded ""others"" articulated an exploration of modern environmental hazards in a place isolated from outsiders. The research reveals not only that epistemic difference shaped these women's perception of risk, but also that their responses were modified through ongoing obligation to cultural and religious separation, and a centuries-old resistance to change and modernity. By focusing on the influence of culture in risk perception, this case study contributes essential insights for environmental planners and managers into developing collaborative work with conservative religious communities faced with environmental hazards.

These changes are not to be interpreted as homogenious adaptations abstract global effects, but they are translated in a dynamic process and mixed with existing (and ""traditional"") everyday practices. In urban space. which is composed by the materiality, historicity, social practice, and experience of the people who live this space are inscribed. Therefore urban space as a site of the local can be considered as the site where global tendencies we adopted subjectively and on the level of everyday life.

It was formed by the Tungusic people in association with refugees from Koguryo, which had fallen in 668. It actively imported Chinese culture and political system and boasted a high standard of civilization. While bringing tribute to Tang China, it dispatched envoys to Japan many times across the sea.

227,2.0,1997,Article,Art in the urban landscape,"This paper discusses the emerging use of public art in cities as a means of positively transforming the urban environment. It emphasizes the need for a symbiosis between an appropriate urban design and the natural transformation that occurs with the placement of sculptures in an urban context. It comments on several examples of planned artistic interventions and, in particular, analyses a recent major project of urban design in Concepcion, the third largest city in Chile. An environmental vision, that addresses itself to the contemporary city's development, has also to consider that urban spaces should provide adequate venues for leisure and civic entertainment for the inhabitant. Historically, the notion of art has been associated with the degree of culture of society and, indeed, it represents the expression and spirit of our urban communities. Hence, together with the macro-planning goals of development, there exists a chance to restore people's sense of belonging and pride of place, providing adequate spaces related to artistic manifestations that can contribute to the overall quality of life in neighbourhoods and inner city areas. The conclusions suggest that these types of artistic expression can be a key factor, but only by integration, that is a combination of an appropriate scale of intervention through urban design, rather than 'parachuting' the art into different places. © 1997 E. & EN Spon.",,Cartes I.,10.1057/udi.1997.31
228,2.0,1991,Article,Space as a resource,"At the micro level of a shelter programme, space is the most important commodity, which needs to be optimally used not only for upgrading the immediate and overall environment but also for reasons of the economics, finance, life style, tradition and culture of the people who are expected to live there. The author, one of the leading architects and planners in India today, brings out the futility of a cosmetic approach to planning ideas, where significant resources are ignored and which remain untapped and unutilized but which could make our living environment more congenial and desirable. This paper highlights the most intimate relationship of man with the immediate environment in our settlements. The author has made suggestions which can integrate and transform the space we are wasting as an invaluable resource for upgrading the quality of life in human settlements.

229,1.0,2021,Article,Continuity in tradition: A narrative on the cultural heritage of para and adda in Kolkata,"'Para' and 'adda' are two unique examples of intangible cultural resources of the Indian state of Bengal and Bangladesh. Para signifies a community or neighbourhood that share close spatial proximity and similar emotional ideology, whereas adda denotes an exchange of casual or intellectual discussions among people. Para refers to a spatial connotation with a neighbourhood, but the physical manifestation is not the only pre-requisite to form a para. Para reflects a networked social cohesion as the continuous affection concretely demonstrated in people's decisions about where to live, how to work and with whom to engage in their daily lives. Culture, ethnicity, language, food habit, mutual feelings of belongingness and robust social networking within a neighbourhood contribute to the growth of a para. Adda propagates the intensity of social networking and influence the development of para. The paper uses narratives to comprehend the co-evolution and correlation of para and adda as an unwavering tradition among the Bengali community in Kolkata. © 2021 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.",Infrastructure planning; Town & city planning; Urban regeneration,Biswas A.,10.1680/jurdp.21.00016
232,1.0,2021,Article,Structural beauty: A structure-based computational approach to quantifying the beauty of an image,"To say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder means that beauty is largely subjective so varies from person to person. While the subjectivity view is commonly held, there is also an objectivity view that seeks to measure beauty or aesthetics in some quantitative manners. Christopher Alexander has long discovered that beauty or coherence highly correlates to the number of subsymmetries or substructures and demonstrated that there is a shared notion of beauty—structural beauty—among people and even different peoples, regardless of their faiths, cultures, and ethnicities. This notion of structural beauty arises directly out of living structure or wholeness, a physical and mathematical structure that underlies all space and matter. Based on the concept of living structure, this paper develops an approach for computing the structural beauty or life of an image (L) based on the number of automatically derived substructures (S) and their inherent hierarchy (H). To verify this approach, we conducted a series of case studies applied to eight pairs of images including Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and Jackson Pollock’s Blue Poles. We discovered among others that Blue Poles is more structurally beautiful than the Mona Lisa, and traditional buildings are in general more structurally beautiful than their modernist counterparts. This finding implies that goodness of things or images is largely a matter of fact rather than an opinion or personal preference as conventionally conceived. The research on structural beauty has deep implications on many disciplines, where beauty or aesthetics is a major concern such as image understanding and computer vision, architecture and urban design, humanities and arts, neurophysiology, and psychology. © 2021 by the authors.

233,1.0,2021,Book Chapter,A study of built morphology and cultural imagery—a case of bengaluru pettah: Historic core of the city,"Cities are composition of complex matrix of neighbourhood held together by the movement networks. The local neighbourhood is very important to understand how people conceive the city in their minds. The representative memory captures the elements related to spatial identity of a place, but more often than not, these representations are pictorial images superimposed upon the fabric resulted from the standardized tools used for analysing the spatial qualities and its attributes. The recognition of the finding to capture elements related to experiences of spatial identity problematizes from well-established urban design spatial theories. On the other hand, Indian city is a collective of people, place and events. These neighbourhoods may not be central to social or business relationships nor centre for historic monuments, but the activities, users, events, location and spatial conditions that support them are very different—together key to the legibility of the city. More often than not, the impacts due to the city’s regeneration process sustain the test of time and manifest into a deeper system for building an image of the place. Hence, embedded meaning and meaningful association over time become crucial for the built morphology. One such neighbourhood is Pettah1—the old core of city of Bangalore. Bengaluru was one of the key trading centres of the south during the pre-colonial era. The idea of a town structured around Pettah (market), Kote2 (fort), Kere3 (lakes and tanks) and Totha4 (gardens and parks) was an unquestionable matrix of natural occurrences and cultural practices. Decades to follow many influences on to the town added a layer of new structure, and every stage of progress enunciated the past with a new skin of elements. It is this value of city’s memory that lie buried within us carrying forward our past into its present fabric. Hence, the study reveals the need to radically departure from the routines of recording legibility and imageability through mental, sensory and visual mapping and to record in terms of space, events, time, activities as well as sense of public-ness. Ultimately, the findings also brings optimism into urban design practice, offering new insight into how to record mosaic of an area in an Indian city that will capture the strong perceived and conceived imagery of a place and hence sensitive responsive proposals that will aid to carefully conceive a system for the future. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Character; Culture; Elusive; Morphology; Neighbourhood,"Bydar Shubhashchandra S., Subramanian R.R.",10.1007/978-3-030-51961-2_18
234,1.0,2021,Article,Where do you live and what do you drive: Built-environmental and spatial effects on vehicle type choice and vehicle use,"The carbon footprint of daily travel for an individual household is based on the types of vehicles that the household owns, their fuel efficiency, and the number of miles traveled (Federal Highway Administration, 2009). Therefore, the types and usage of vehicles a household owns are informational to overall sustainable planning. This study develops a multinomial logit model for vehicle type choice and a spatial autoregressive (SAR) model for vehicle use for Ohio households using the most recent Household Travel Survey (HTS) collected in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The developed vehicle choice model identifies the effects of the built environment characteristics on vehicle type based on vehicle size, controlling for socio-economic attributes. People residing in neighborhoods characterized with higher densities in population, employment, and intersection and with fewer single detached housing are more likely to own smaller vehicles as compared to the ones living in suburban areas. A good transit accessibility would decrease the probability of owning pickup trucks. The SAR model reveals how the vehicle a household owns is used is still slightly positively associated with his/her neighbour’s vehicle use after controlling for the effects of the built environment and socio-economics. The models will enable decision makers to estimate potential changes in vehicle fleet composition under changing built environment scenarios and neighborhood culture in using private vehicles. Although the model results and estimated coefficients may be different for different urban areas, the methodology is transferable to other communities, locally and nationally. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cluster analysis; multinomial logit; spatial autoregression; vehicle type choice; vehicle use,"Chen N., Akar G., Gordon S.I., Chen S.",10.1080/15568318.2020.1762950
236,1.0,2020,Article,Resonating the ‘culture’ debate in urban planning,"In this era of rapid urbanisation, an understanding of the role of culture in advancing urban planning and development is important for effective urban management, especially in Africa where the culture of informality is dominant. Yet, there is a dearth of research on the relationship between the culture of informality and urban planning in Africa. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to analyse the influence of the culture of informality on urban planning and development in Kumasi, a rapidly urbanizing city in Ghana; and (ii) to explore how local people perceive and consider their culture of informality in the context of urban planning as a tool for development. Using mixed methods research approach (surveys, agency interviews, document review, and participant observation), findings indicate that four out of five identified values of the culture of informality have statistically significant positive influence on urban planning and development. However, there is institutional neglect of the culture of informality in urban planning due to limited understanding of the relevance of informality in urban development, contributing to environmental and socio-economic challenges (e.g., slums proliferation, extinction of green spaces). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Culture; Informality; Kumasi; Urban development; Urban planning; Urbanisation,"Cobbinah P.B., Asibey M.O., Gyau N.B.",10.1016/j.ccs.2020.100369
237,1.0,2020,Conference Paper,"Monitoring of electrical consumption, including self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic","To date, one of the most relevant tasks is a justified calculation of the electrical capacity of residential buildings and public facilities. Studies conducted by the 'Roselectromontazh' Association have shown a significant difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity, which is further confirmed by the reports of electric grid companies. In some cases, there is a 3-fold difference. This occurs due to the emergence of a sustainable culture of electricity consumption and the use of highly energy-efficient devices. In 2019, the results of the research work were taken into account in the regional urban planning standards of the Republic of Tatarstan. On average, the normative values have been reduced by 2 times. This enabled a significant reduction in the difference between the actual and calculated electrical capacity. From 2020 onwards, leading construction companies in the Republic of Tatarstan are applying up-to-date values to decrease utility services' construction costs. For power grid companies the savings consist of reduction of electrical energy losses and 'locked electrical capacity' and the elimination of inefficient investments. It is important to note that specific values of electrical load were calculated taking into account summer and winter peaks in order to exclude the emergencies. However, it was impossible to predict a time when people would need to stay self-isolated at home to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2019). Corresponding diagrams relative to 2019 were constructed to determine the impact of the electricity consumption of residential buildings during lockdown. © 2020 IEEE.",Calculated electrical load; COVID-19; Daily power profiles; Electrical power supply system; Locked electrical capacity; Standby electric power,"Soluyanov Y., Fedotov A., Akhmetshin A., Khalturin V.",10.1109/USEC50097.2020.9281179
238,1.0,2020,Article,Urban cohesion vis-à-vis organic spatialization of “Third places” in Saudi Arabia: The need for an alternative planning praxis,"Many medium-sized middle-eastern cities like Khobar in Saudi Arabia have become a popular destination for predominantly low-to semi-skilled expatriate workers from several South and South East Asian countries. The social spatialization of these working class people has been manifested in compartmentalized public spaces as specific ethnic oriented “third places”, such as Filipino markets, Bangladeshi bazaar, and Pakistani neighborhood. Yet, there is no research scholarship available on the nature and type of such third places and their importance and influences on plan making process in the middle-eastern context. Certain (re-)defining themes, notably expressing and celebrating everyday culture, feeling of home being away from home, sense of places, and center places for socialization and integration emerge to brand these places as we explored empirical evidence with grounded theory centered socio-cultural lenses. Additionally, exploring spatio-temporal permeability of these third places using Space Syntax accessibility model helped us to draw critical insights about how such lessons and practices can challenge the contemporary city planning and design practices. Critical planning interventions like collaborative governance of third places as proposed here can be adopted in making cities like Khobar cohesive. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Collaborative governance; Public space; Space Syntax; Spatialization; Third place; Urban cohesion,"Nahiduzzaman K.M., Aldosary A., Ahmed S., Hewage K., Sadiq R.",10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102258
239,1.0,2020,Review,Designing healthy mobility in cities: how urban planning can promote walking and cycling [Alltagsmobilität in Städten gesund gestalten: wie Stadtplanung Fuß- und Radverkehr fördern kann],"Mobility is a prerequisite for satisfying essential human needs. Work, education, social participation: all these activities generate regular journeys. Particularly in cities, however, the “side effects” of mobility such as traffic jams, traffic accidents, air pollution, noise and the resulting health effects are also evident. The planning of settlement structures, the necessary infrastructures, and the design of urban spaces are tasks of urban planning. Urban planning can have a decisive influence on the means of transport people choose, the distances they travel, and the environmental and health effects associated with these choices. This article examines how urban planning can promote alternatives to motorized individual travel. It focuses in particular on active mobility, such as cycling and walking. The paper begins by presenting the fundamental effects of everyday mobility and the resulting traffic on health. It then gives an overview of the potential for promoting active mobility in Germany and how urban planning and the factors it regulates, such as settlement density or mix of uses, influence mobility decisions. An overview of current initiatives and an in-depth presentation of planning strategies in the cities of Barcelona and Bogotá will be used to show which instruments and measures are being used. The article emphasizes that urban planning and the built environment it creates can promote walking and cycling. The examples show, however, that promising initiatives are not realised through spatial planning and the creation of infrastructure alone. Rather, they are cross-sectoral measures aimed at changing the mobility culture in cities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",Active mobility; Cycling campaign; Public space; Superblocks; Urban design,"Heinrichs D., Jarass J.",10.1007/s00103-020-03180-1
240,1.0,2020,Book,Youth culture and identity in northern thailand: Fitting in and sticking out,"Youth Culture and Identity in Northern Thailand examines how young people in urban Chiang Mai construct an identity at the intersection of global capitalism, state ideologies, and local culture. Drawing on over 15 years of ethnographic research, the book explores the impact of rapid urbanisation and modernisation on contemporary Thai youth, focusing on conspicuous youth subcultures, drug use (especially methamphetamine use), and violent youth gangs. Anjalee Cohen shows how young Thai people construct a specific youth identity through consumerism and symbolic boundaries – in particular through enduring rural/urban distinctions. The suggestion is that the formation of subcultures and “deviant” youth practices, such as drug use and violence, are not necessarily forms of resistance against the dominant culture, nor a pathological response to dramatic social change, as typically understood in academic and public discourse. Rather, Cohen argues that such practices are attempts to “fit in and stick out” in an anonymous urban environment. This volume is relevant to scholars in Thai Studies, Southeast Asian Studies, Anthropology, Sociology, Urban Studies, and Development Studies, particularly those with an interest in youth, drugs, and gangs. © 2020 Anjalee Cohen.",,Cohen A.,10.4324/9781351127745
241,1.0,2019,Conference Paper,The role of social and cultural interaction between Russian and Chinese students in changing the educational space of the Russian University,"Students as a special social group can be considered as a guide of interaction between the partner countries of Russia and China as representatives of different cultures and different mentalities. Interaction between Russian and Chinese universities in the scientific and educational sphere has specific features and reflects the general mechanisms of functioning in social and cultural environment. The socio-cultural context of such interaction is the life activity of megalopolis, regional features and it is related to the socio-cultural traditions of people relationship. The general purpose of the study was to identify changes in interaction between Russian and Chinese students studying in a Russian University. The study conducted in Russian and Chinese Universities. The research methodology combined both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The primary data was collected using questionnaires and in-depth interviews. Three hundred and ninety respondents - Russian students and five hundred respondents - Chinese students, were questioned on the basis of quota sampling. Depths interviews were conducted with 20 experts. The study has revealed some actual issues and tendencies of social interaction in the educational sphere. It has a temporal character and it is developed in a single educational environment of universities-partners of Russia and China. The study has identified the structure of social interaction, consisting of five levels: 1. At the level of connectivity, social relations between social and ethnic groups (in this case, Russian and Chinese students) are established on the basis of their values. 2. At the level of translation, understanding of the values of another (different) culture through the interpretation of cultural codes (cultural signs) takes place. 3. At the level of transcendence, transition from one's cultural system to another, the development of positive experience and knowledge of another cultural system take place. 4. At the level of adaptation, an interiorization, application in behaviour and activity of values of other cultural system take place. 5. At the level of inter cultural dialogue, an organization of effective and fruitful cooperation between social and ethnic groups and their representatives based on an understanding of the universal values takes place. The five levels of social interaction identified by researches in the joint educational environment of Russian and Chinese universities allow not only to find out the content components of the structure of social and cultural interaction, but also to consider its dynamics and development. Our research has identified a set of factors that affect the functioning of the interaction between Russian and Chinese students structure: geopolitical situation, cost and quality of education, adaptation of training courses for foreigners, comfort of the educational environment of University, the complexity of learning of the host country language, the prestige of education. This model of interaction between social and ethnic groups of Russian and Chinese students being representatives of partner universities is confirmed by the real practice of scientific and educational cooperation between Russian and Chinese universities. Joint forms of University work have been successfully tested and activities that have become events of inter cultural dialogue have been organized. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

242,1.0,2019,Conference Paper,Myths and Realities of Adaptable city. Contemporary City as Adaptable Hybrid,"Global space - both natural and cultural - is the greatest good belonging to the human community. The said community has, therefore, the right and responsibility to protect it, wisely and in solidarity, from wasteful exploitation. The postulate of public utility of this good must also presume such mutual conditioning of the rights and obligations of private owners that would minimise the chance of their infringement of collective interests. The culture of space management became an important measure of cultural level of societies at the turn of the 20th century, perhaps one of those moments which decide upon the future of our civilisation. The conclusion that large agglomerations in particular are ""incorrigible zones of spatial and social pathology, from which we need to escape into pristine areas and there create a more perfect living environment"" is unacceptable, also from the ethical point of view, both as regards the people living in those agglomerations and nature. As far as what has been created by man is concerned, we need to assume that we are able to control and improve this material creation of our civilisation. Such is the fundamental requirement of sustainable development - a difficult, but probably the only way of managing ""the global village"" in the millennium that has just commenced. The spatial structure of the contemporary city as a whole is a broken form: it has formally expressive and perfectly composed elements, it has mutilated compositions, chaotic arrangements and ""lost spaces"", finally, it has spaces that as yet have not been properly used compositionally and are still waiting for their role in the whole. A broken form - in compliance with the principle of irreversibility - may not return to its original composition. Thinking about the future of the city and taking into account the irrefutable fact that a considerable part of the built environment of tomorrow already exists today, we should ask ourselves the question: can it adopt, as a whole, a composition of a different kind? If the urbanised environment, being the basic one, is also to become a full-value environment for human existence, it will require continuous and universal improvement of its quality, as well as new strategies, methods and scenarios for rational organisation of urbanised space that will be able to meet new challenges. It seems that ""dramaturgically consistent logic of composition"" may become an original formula of urban public space.

243,1.0,2019,Conference Paper,"Urban Landscape-Cubic Stone Streets in Historical Areas, Advantages and Disadvantages, Case Study Timisoara Versus Rome","Cubic stone streets are part of the identity of historic cities. Over the last decades, most of the streets have been replaced by new but more perishable finishes, which have seriously damaged their historical appearance. Timisoara, the city on the Bega River, also called Little Vienna, still owns fourteen historic streets covered with cubic stone from the interwar period. From an urban point of view, there are two coherent assemblies of cobbled streets in Elisabetin interwar neighbourhood and four other isolated streets in other areas of the city. Architects, landscape architects and culture people, inhabitants of Timisoara, want to stop the approach of local councillors who adopted in 2016 a feasibility study on the modernization of the last fourteen cubic stone streets by asphalting them. The immediate result of this article is the awareness of those involved in the city's problems by accessing a detailed and clear explanation of their importance to the city and the consequences of removing the cubic stone streets from the city. The multiple advantages of these streets are studied in direct connection with the area they belong to, depending on their local need and the benefits they give. A simple comparison with cities from Italy, such as Rome, can make us not only more aware of their importance, but also teaches us that without a clear set of rules on their maintenance over time, the city could not still benefit from their existence, after hundreds of years of use. Historic areas are massively losing their appearance once the old pavement is replaced by asphalt cover. The areas of the cobbled streets mentioned in the modernization program are part of the historical protective areas or even integral part of the Elisabetin neighbourhood monument areas. To uncover the streets in question and to deprive them of their original image of cubic stone pavement, it simply represents the destruction of the historical identity of an entire area and therefore the image of the city. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Mohora I., Anghel A.A.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/8/082028

245,1.0,2018,Book,From urban national parks to natured cities in the global south: The quest for naturbanity,"This important volume focuses on the sensitive issue of interrelationships between national parks situated near or within urban areas and their urban environment. It engages with both urban and conservation issues and and compares four national parks located in four large cities in the global South: Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Mumbai, and Nairobi. Though primarily undertaken as academic research, the project has intensively collaborated with the institutions in charge of these parks. The comparative structure of this volume is also original and unique: each of the chapters incorporates insight from all four sites as far as possible.The term ""naturbanity"" expresses the necessity for cities endowed with a national park to integrate it into their functioning. Conversely, such parks must take into account their location in an urban environment, both as a source of heavy pressures on nature and as a nexus of incentives to support their conservation. The principle of non-exclusivity, that is, neither the city nor the park has a right nor even the possibility to negate the other's presence, summarizes the main argument of this book. Naturbanity thus blurs the old ""modern"" dichotomy of nature/culture: animals and human beings can often jump the physical and ideological walls separating many parks from the adjacent city. The 13 chapters and substantive introduction of this volume discuss various aspects of naturbanity: the histories of park creation; interaction between people and parks; urban governance and parks; urban conservation models; wildlife management; environmental education; and so on. This is a must-read for students and researchers interested in social ecology, social geography, conservation, urban planning and ecological policy. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

The purpose of the article is to theoretically substantiate the importance of preserving historical memory as one of the key priorities of urban planning and public policy. The leading approach to the study of this problem is the analysis of cultural heritage objects, based on linguistic data, lexicographic evidence (toponyms), ethnocultural communities (voloki), and also on the basis of archaeological excavations, the stages of the formation of East Slavic unity and the settlement of Novgorod Slavs are considered. On the basis examined materials shown that the space of settlement of ethnic communities in specific landscapes is fixed by historical monuments, which on a time scale became signs of the culture of urban development.

248,1.0,2017,Conference Paper,Use of Daylight and Aesthetic Image of Glass Facades in Contemporary Buildings,"The paper deals with the architecture of contemporary buildings in respect to their aesthetic image created by the use of natural light. Sustainability is regarded as a governing principle of contemporary architecture, where daylighting is an important factor as it affects energy consumption and environmental quality of the space inside a building. Environmental awareness of architecture, however, involves a much wider and more holistic view of design. The quality of sustainable architecture can be considered in its aesthetic and cultural context with regard to landscape, local tradition, and connection to the surrounding world. This approach is associated with the social mission of architecture, i.e. providing appropriate space for living, facilitating social relations and having positive impact on people. The purpose of the research is to study the use of daylight in creating an aesthetic image of contemporary buildings. The author focuses mainly on public buildings largely dedicated to art and culture which satisfy high functional and aesthetic requirements. The paper examines the genesis and current trends in the aesthetic image of modern buildings which use daylight as the main design strategy, focusing on the issues of glass facades. The main attention is given to the shaping of representative public areas which feature the glass facades. The research has been based on a case study, critical review of literature review, observation and synthesis. The study identifies and classifies different approaches to using daylight in these areas and highlights changes in the aesthetics of architecture made of glass, which uses daylight as the main design strategy. These changes are primarily caused by the development and spreading of new glazing materials and the use of digital method of design. The influence of light and its mode depends on glass materials but also on the local conditions of the site, and has a significant impact on the relationship between architecture and its natural and cultural environment. The subordination of architectural concept to the idea of natural lighting builds the relationship between form, function and the context of architecture, and is expressed in its structural, material and spatial properties, and in the resulting aesthetic order. Search for new architectural solutions is defined by local topographical, climatic, biological and cultural conditions. The architecture subordinate to the conception of contribution of light corresponds to the aesthetic aspirations of sustainability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Roginska-Niesluchowska M.,10.1088/1757-899X/245/8/082035
252,1.0,2017,Conference Paper,Modality environments: A concept for sustainability and vitality in the multi-modal city,"This paper reviews an idea of vital local high-street places with their walking spaces and economies founded in interfaces between neighbourhood and city (between walking and public transport/bicycle movement infrastructures). It then extends this idea to higher scales, considering interfaces between city and region, which have already been theorised as 'mobility environments' (Bertolini & Dijst 2003) focusing on places and modal transfer points in new regional cities of high mobility. High-streets and mobility environments are both central places and our way of describing them suggests a new definition of central places as interfaces between normative (but also technically-infrastructually supported) political spaces (neighbourhood, city and region). It also clarifies the role of scale in place theory and we will deal with this in a following paper. Here we introduce ideas of 'modality places' and 'modality environments'. The 'modality environment' is concerned with areal and network transportation forms in whole fabrics and resulting conditions of sustainability and urbanity. Modality environments are understood in terms of transportation networks and the social and functional factors (like sustainability and urbanity) they produce. Modality environments are seen as lived environments built around movement infrastructure grids that distribute everyday urban functions. Ideally modality environments would be simple clear grids that distribute all or close to all the functions of everyday life so that a walking grid or a bicycle grid that gets adults to work, their children to school and includes shopping and recreation would be walking or bicycle modality environments. They would be expected to have high levels of direct visibility-legibility in the way urban elements present themselves to a mobile community. Modality environments would also include the central places (like high-streets or mobility environments like stations) at which people would transfer to other modality environments. We will use a notion of 'movement culture' to indicate the convergence of land uses and mobile communities mediated in information-rich networks. We are concerned first with how modality environments (for cycling or walking for example) may afford more sustainable lifestyles. We are concerned in addition with the ways they can be designed to include central places as zones of urbanity and vitality and as socially and culturally mixed centres. We start not with a principle of accessibility of/from nodes in an extensive space but with the idea that particular social and political territories (communities and polities) are already articulations of distinct modality environments.

253,1.0,2017,Conference Paper,Fostering a More 'Cultured' City through Inclusion: Metrics for Sense of Belonging for Migrants in Chinese Urban Areas,"Over the past four decades, infrastructural and economic development in Chinese cities has outpaced its cultural development. As the proportion of people living in cities in China quintupled from 1950 to 2014, from 11% to 54% according to a 2009 report by McKinsey, while at the same time various challenges have paved the way to limit cultural prosperity and quality of life in cities. Cities currently face number of problems: Vehicle-oriented streets are not friendly to pedestrians; public spaces are designed without users in mind [1]; communities are isolated from one another [2]; and finally creative industries are lagging behind other industries according to a 2014 Forbes report. It seems that China's urban development states a condition of ""survivability"" rather than ""livability"". What is understood from the notion of livability within a city today is to be able to sustain quality of life through holistic planning strategies rather than purely economic ones. Such cities create robust natural environments as well as built environments, social equity as well as social stability. And as a result both a more reliable creative prosperity and economic prosperity have been maintained. This paper will seek to establish a 3-pillar approach to social inclusion and will examine each of these through issues related with migrants in China facing today. It seems that there is a great potential in using mobile and web-based technologies to generate rapid and sustainable solutions for migrants.

254,1.0,2015,Article,"Colonial architectures, urban planning and the representation of portuguese imperial history","This article proposes a critical analysis of recent interpretations made to the history of architecture and urban planning in the Portuguese colonial context in the twentieth century, particularly in the former African territories. More generally, it intends to explore how the internal history produced by specific fields of activity, such as architecture or urbanism, can reinforce the logic of a national and nationalized history. This effect is due partly to the fact that the legitimacy of these fields is largely dependent on the national identification in the context of activities that are internationalized. I will argue that the specific field of activity, while creating this internal discourse, can directly or indirectly produce representations of the nation, its history and its people on a larger scale, penetrating popular culture and influencing a shared common sense. In the case in question, the internal discourse on architectural and urbanistic works, on authors and styles, eventually reinforces an idealized and idyllic image of Portuguese colonialism. © 2015 Intellect Ltd Dossier.",Architecture; Modernization; Portuguese colonialism; Representation memory; Urban planning,Domingos N.,10.1386/pjss.14.3.235_1
255,1.0,2015,Article,Definition Expression on the Concept of Urban Ecotourism through Theoretical Review of Related Challenges,"Introduction: To explore the basis of ecotourism, we should look for the basis of literature concerning the tourism development and emersion of sustainability though it. Tourism planning has progressed over this period after the WWII, with a detonation of economic and marketing ideas coming to tourism planning. Thus, it is called ""Boosterism"" which we cannot consider it as a model of planning at all and model of ""Mass tourism"" with the belief of ""the more is the better"" was the best idea for its tourism development. Economic approach, with marketing techniques as its tolls is the next step in tourism development. During the 1970s, the results of tourism development proceeded, was an uneven distribution of benefits, and recognition of multitude of negative tourism's impacts became more evident, so the question of development raised up as ""growth paradigm"" which referred ""cautionary perspective"" to this school of thought which this perspective might be considered as the physical/spatial planning tradition. The summery of evolution in the Think/Idea, Model and Tools in Tourism development after WWII are mentioned in Table 1. (Table Presented) During the 80's decades there are a great discussion between the tourism planning literature and language of marketing to prolong the destination's growth stage. In late 1980, the theorizers described the model of ""soft tourism"" and considered it as the new development model instead of mass tourism. Also during this period ""responsible tourism"", ""green tourism"", and ""appropriate tourism"" introduced as new terms. The concept of sustainable tourism was bring together in the late 1980's by the tourism industry's reaction to the Brundtland report on sustainable development following the WCED in 1987. Some explains that conference report ""Our Common Future"" as ""Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"". All above discussions and critics replaced by the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, that marked the beginning of a worldwide commitment which replaced Sustainable development (as a right in Agenda 21) must be applied in a way that respond to the social and environmental needs of current and future generation. But the problem was it is ignored on the working agenda and three pillars. In Barbados Conference it was for the first time that ""sustainable tourism"" and ""nature based tourism"" recognized as the branch of the sustainable development in final dissertation and action plans, and also ecotourism, economic growth and environmental preservation introduced as sustainable tourism development elements in all conference branches. Discussion and Results: The article, explore the discussion on ecotourism through an expansion of its meaning starts from the Hetzer states about ""ecological tourism"" and then other theorizers, and then explore discussion about ""the concept of ecotourism"" through the viewpoints of some critic. They all can be concluded as below items: • Sustainable use of biodiversity and natural resources; • Impact minimisation, both upon the natural and socio-cultural environment, especially in therms of climate change energy, energy consumption and traditional cultures; • Empowerment and fully informed participation of local stakeholders, particularly local communities and indigenous peoples; • Awarness-raising and environmental education of all stakeholders, especially travellers and hosts; • Lasting economic benefits for all actors. In comparison of the meaning and concept of ecotourism, we have one important question: why ""small scale"" and ""the exact location-the location where action of ecotourism occurs"" is not mentioned in above five elements? By literature review, it is obviously that although there is no great dissension between theorizers but there is not any common agreement on the discussion about that question too. There is a discussion about comparison of the mass tourism and soft tourism and he conclude that mass tourism ought to be useful for preserved areas, so it can be rejected the small scale. Also it can be drawn two polar of extremes for continuum of ecotourism paradigm. One pole is the view that all tourism (including ecotourism) has negative impacts on the nature. Conversely in the other pole, human are viewed as living creatures (as it called fauna) - whose behavior and activities is inevitably ""natural""⋯ so therefore human behavior is ""natural"". As the human is part of the ""natural process"" and, as a result, they are literally unable and powerless to act and behave unnaturally. Therefore, no differention between ecotourism and other models of tourism in terms of their ""naturalness"" and thus, all ecotourism is tourism and conversely. This argument shows that there are no common agreements on the scale of ecotourism. So as it concluded in article three items can be considered as the common agreement on the concept of ecotourism: • Environmental/Biodiversity conservation and reduction of travel and development impacts; • Local economic empowerment; • Education through ecological and cultural Travel and experience. After 1990's decade correlated with the world acceptation on the definitions of ecotourism, the experimental activities tried to implement the concept of ecotourism in the urban area. This pragmatically activity starts with the activities of Green Tourism Association (GTA) in the city of Toronto in 1996. The next important step was the first international Urban Ecotourism Conference hold in in 2004, in its declaration, it respect Urban Ecotourism as an ongoing opportunity to conserve biological and social diversity, create new jobs and improve the quality of life and delivered declaration by these four goal as it deliberately defined by Planeta: • Restoring and conserving natural and cultural heritage including natural landscapes and biodiversity, and indigenous cultures; • Maximizing local benefits and engaging the local community as owners, investors, hosts and guides; • Educating visitors and residents on environmental matters, heritage resources, sustainability; • Reducing our ecological footprint. In the article it discussed ideas and implemented project according to the urban ecotourism. All those projects have this hypothesis that urban ecotourism is an applied idea so all of them try to implement their ideas by experiment them in a real urban region. According to all of them, urban ecotourism is an opportunity to conserve our urban areas and make it more sustainable. Some experimental articles is tried to define the dimension of urban ecotourism using fuzzy numbers construction. They tried to introduce an alternative approach, the fuzzy number construction approach, to construct Sustainable Urban Ecotourism Indicators System (SUEIS), which may contribute to the understanding of urban ecotourism, and to excavate the discrepancies of urban ecotourism and traditional ecotourism. The most important thing is that a relative unanimity is in the urban ecotourism theorizers article and case study. Constituents of their principles includes the concept of ecotourism which deployed expressions like these in their work. The concept of urban ecotourism consequence of the experimented and discussion can be draw in a diagram as below: (Figure Presented) Conclusion: Most of the theorizers believe that urban ecotourism is a Contradiction in term. In this regard there are some practitioners who implemented the ecotourism in an urban region. Conversely, the group believed in urban ecotourism, predicate others as ""traditional ecotourism"" and try to deduce theirselves. In this article by discussion on evolutionary configuring the concept of ecotourism, it tries to consequence that there is no differention between two groups. In the other hand, the urban ecotourism is not a new paradigm and according to their pragmatist approaches it depends on the three main concept which those are as same as the ecotourism. While urban ecotourism is a burgeoning subject in the research of ecotourism, more attempts are needed to interpret the contents of urban ecotourism.",Sustainable development; Tourism planning; Urban ecology; Urban ecotourism; Urban planning,"Sabbaghi H.R., Tabibian M.",

This paper points out that the landscape is not only a space place, but also can reflect people's ideology, moreover, landscape is even more a kind of meaning experience foe people. Using Saussure 's Signifier and Signified Theory and Pierce's three theory of types to discuss the meaning of the landscape symbol, the landscape is regarded as a symbolic text, referring to the relationship between signifier and signified, emphasizing on the landscape symbols to show the meaning recognized by the audiences by means of the the specific form. On this basis, the meaning representation of the landscape symbol can be divided into three types: image symbol, indexing symbol, symbolic sign, and points out the complexity of the symbol is the highest, which needs the viewer has the relevant cultural background. Finally this paper states the ambiguity and openness of the landscape significance, and the relationship with the context design, aiming to provide references and inspirations for the related designing. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Landscape; Meaning; Semiotics,Li Y.,10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.671-674.2792

Modern cities are at the heart of economic growth, driving innovation and delivering a breeding ground for culture. With greater size comes enhanced efficiency, but for large cities to maximize this potential they need to attract innovative people and investment to make the ideas happen. They need to find a way to leverage the benefits big cities bring, while managing the inevitable challenges they face. Social and economic pressures, plus these technological opportunities, create challenges for cities that engineers working in a multidisciplinary environment are well placed to address. These are simple examples of city systems being made more efficient through an integrated approach and the use of technology.

260,1.0,2009,Book Chapter,Staying too long at the fair: Philadelphia planning and the debacle of 1976,"In 1682, 1776, or 1876, the optimism of Edmund Bacon's remarkable 1959 vision for Philadelphia's future-""Philadelphia in the Year 2009""-would have surprised no one. From its founding, Philadelphia's unfolding futures were consistently dynamic, focusing the energies of colonial expansion, democratic governance, and industrialization in one urban crucible. No other city in America exhibited each trend so dramatically. It was the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876- with the glass and steel dome of its Memorial Hall, its displays of telegraphy and the telephone, its prototype steam automobiles-that first demonstrated to Americans what an industrialized nation might really look like. Ed Bacon was an enthusiast of world's fairs and public exhibitions, writing and speaking of them throughout his career to illustrate and promote trends in urban development, and working in the genre himself to advance a far-reaching planning agenda for Philadelphia in the postwar decades. Philadelphia emerged from World War II burdened by creaking infrastructure and a housing shortage, its Center City business district underperforming against rival cities. Deindustrialization was already noticeable by the mid-1950s, an emerging economic reality that foretold difficulty in achieving the social goals of a new and aggressive generation of reform-minded political leadership.1 Residents were embarking for the suburbs at a steady clip, with the city falling by 1960 from third to fourth in population behind Los Angeles.2 Bacon's 50-year vision projected against this backdrop might have struck the reader as cheerful but unrealistic, even naïve. But what good is a prophecy if it does not reveal a hidden future, a future obstructed? Bacon's future was a city revitalized, beautified, and modernized in time to host the nation's Bicentennial celebration and a simultaneous 1976 Philadelphia World's Fair. Imaginative planning was his method, enabling the political gatekeepers along with the citizens of the city to see with him decades ahead and to grasp the occasion of a fair to accomplish lasting change for the city's built environment and its people. ""Philadelphia in the Year 2009"" builds its case on this one powerful idea: A world's fair could transform it into a model of humane urbanism.3 Considering his vantage point in 1959, it is possible to imagine why Ed Bacon might predict the future of Philadelphia with such mesmerizing flourishes. The Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC), under his directorship, was in the midst of one of the longest winning streaks any urban planning body had or has ever achieved. With Penn Center, Society Hill, Independence Mall, the neighborhoods of Eastwick and the Far Northeast each underway or finished, Bacon and his team of young planners were totally in their stride in 1959, working to think, dig, and build the city out of its rut. The Market East transportation center, a pedestrian-friendly Chestnut Street, and a tourist-friendly Delaware waterfront were all on Bacon's drawing board, too. These were the varied pieces, described in turn by each of the authors in this volume, of a full urban-renewal portfolio advanced consistently over more than two decades by the PCPC. Postwar federal legislation enabled city officials for the first time to broadly exercise eminent domain powers, moving masses of residents and bulldozing whole sections of the city, planning and building anew.4 Ed Bacon's PCPC was certainly of its time in this respect and forceful in its place, stirring up both wonder and backlash. The old industrial city, the city that had lain fallow through the Depression and World War II, was awakening slowly to the possibility of highrises and integrated transportation hubs, and at the same time rediscovering its walkable character and the vernacular beauties of its historic neighborhoods. Bacon's idea was to liberate William Penn's grid from over a century of industrial-age clutter and to make the city simultaneously auto-, pedestrian-, and investment-friendly. Bacon understood the power of display and salesmanship as keys to making his idea of the next Philadelphia into something tangible. In this spirit, his ""2009"" essay arrived on newsstands in 1959. Could new high-rises and a suburban-style shopping center downtown reverse massive job losses and a suburban exodus? Whether the PCPC's projects were comprehensive enough remained an open question in 1959. In this context, the Philadelphia World's Fair could provide a shared goal, a focused way for Bacon to complete the projects he wanted. Market East, the Chestnut Street pedestrian mall, and even the heliports and Kabuki dancers really pale in comparison, though, to his essay's boldest claims. In 2009 Philadelphia will not have any bad neighborhoods, suburbanites will have moved back bringing their vitality and tax dollars with them, greenways will ring the city, transportation options will be rational and varied; the entire metropolis will reflect the best and brightest ideas that modern urban planning can deliver. Bacon's predictions still astound with their self-confidence, and throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, from City Hall to the halls of academia and elite architecture firms and bankers' offices, from newsrooms to neighborhoods across the city, Philadelphians would grapple with the idea that a world's fair could help deliver the future city they desired. This chapter examines the fair-as-urban renewal formula that Ed Bacon worked with to promote his long-range planning objectives in Philadelphia. The ""2009"" essay was just one of the many publications and speeches he used to stimulate and sustain interest in the manifold projects of the PCPC. But here was a truly seductive model of development. If a world's fair could leave useful permanent structures behind while simultaneously rejuvenating public faith in the city, then what was the downside? Ed Bacon and scores of Philadelphians would take up this challenge, shaping it over a 15-year period to fit their own visions for the future of their city. From London's 1851 Crystal Palace Exhibition to New York's 1939 World's Fair, such events periodically announced new eras in technology and science, in business, and in culture. As Bacon and other key players in Philadelphia intuited, they also offered host cities opportunities to innovate in urban design. Starting with Brussels in 1958 a new generation of postwar world's fairs began, and the planning for the Philadelphia Fair took place as fairs were held in Seattle (1962), New York (1964), Montreal (1967), San Antonio (1968), and Osaka (1970). The difficulties of the New York Fair and the success of the Montreal one especially played defining roles as the Philadelphia planning process went forward. Learning and applying lessons from fairs in other cities and other eras proved difficult for Philadelphia's planners. The chapter develops two main analytical points. First, world's fairs have historically proven as different and mercurial as the cities and time periods of their creation, and have rarely inspired large-scale urban renewal in host cities in predictable, linear ways. The historical lessons and legacies of world's fairs for urban planners were (and remain) decidedly ambiguous. But by studying the period of gestation for a fair, and perhaps by extension any large-scale civic undertaking, we gain critical insight into the dominant conflicts shaping the modern city. As the planning process moved into the 1960s and early 1970s, it became more and more evident that the Philadelphia World's Fair of 1976-if it was to happen-would not recreate the 1876 Centennial Exhibition or launch an urban renaissance so much as reflect the clashing ambitions of citizens caught in a declining American industrial metropolis. The final plan, to the extent there ever was one plan, deviated starkly in both intention and design from Bacon's 1959 vision. This leads to the second point. The deviation from Bacon's ""2009"" vision shows two quite specific urban historical processes working in conjunction: The decline of the ""master planner"" and by extension New Deal/Great Society urban liberalism, and the rise of a consensus-seeking planning model driven by the maturation of urban community-based protest movements. The evolving plans for the World's Fair vividly show these trends defining one another, with plans for (and protest against) the Fair emerging from all quarters of the city, diluting the strength of Bacon's 1959 vision, while at the same time adding elements more desirable, more democratic, to the multiple communities affected. Between 1970 and 1972 planning for the Fair broke apart amid a prolonged season of racial strife, intergenerational resentment, federal disinvestment, and a creeping urban pessimism. Combined with hesitant municipal leadership this climate of urban uncertainty clouded the vision of a fair-as-catalyst to a utopian ""Philadelphia in the Year 2009."".

TOD has been successfully implemented in the USA, Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong and many other places; however, its practice in China is so uncommon that few people understand it well. Although it is worthwhile to study the foreign TOD models, Chinese cities cannot simply copy these examples because of how its politics, economic conditions, and regional cultures differ from the countries where TOD has previously been used.

Issues raised by every choice made about land use management and development go to the very heart of our value system, including our values about how place can evoke our sense of identity. While these are clearly concepts of a somewhat abstract nature, fundamental to issues of culture, aesthetics and ethics, they also merit close attention because they relate directly to how we perceive and represent territory, especially in terms of land occupied by people. Such perceptions and representa-tions, though grounded in essentially concrete realities, remain for the most part the product of our imagination. Through reference to the current controversy around the future of Mount Orford National Park, and in particular to the response devised in answer to it by poet Alfred Desrochers, this article endeavours to illustrate how our geographical imagination structures our thinking about territory and land use planning, with an analysis of the symbolic and social identity function of the park, as reported in mainstream media by supporters and opponents of the proposed changes to its use.",Artialization; Geosymbolics; Identity; Literature; Socioterritorial imagination; Territoriality,Bédard M.,10.7202/029875ar

266,1.0,2006,Book Chapter,The 1876 centennial in Philadelphia: Elite networks and political culture,"AT NOON on May 10, 1876-after years of controversy, construction, and fuss-President Ulysses S. Grant and Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil entered Machinery Hall to open the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Since early morning, the day's 186,000 attendees had been streaming through the gates. The president and the emperor stood in front of thirteen acres of motionless machinery, all connected by pulleys, shafts, wheels and belts to the giant Corliss engine in the central transept. Several hundred invited guests, already waiting there, made room for the ceremonial party to climb upon the concrete base of the huge metal monster towering forty feet above their heads almost to the trussed roof of the Hall. Machinery Hall was one of five major buildings put up by exhibition organizers in Fairmount Park; outside groups built dozens more. The Main Building was the largest in the world at the time-over a third of a mile long. Visitors marveled at the items on display: A typewriter, Hires root beer, the Statue of Liberty's torch, the Westinghouse air brake, Fleischmann's yeast, cable from the Brooklyn Bridge, Bell's telephone, and Otis's elevator.2 The Centennial was a resounding success, dramatically displaying Philadelphia's wealth and industrial might. Over nine million people-nearly one-fifth of the country's population-attended before its close in November. It was the first international exposition held in the United States and probably the single most important cultural event of its era. Foreigners flocked to Philadelphia-inaugurating mass tourism to the United States-to see American industrial innovations and dozens of foreign exhibits from Britain, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Japan, China, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and ""two large Arab tents."" This influx of visitors and national cultures also opened Philadelphia andthe United States to a world of new influences; the Japanese exhibit in particular stirred an Oriental design fashion in the United States.3 Beyond the pomp, the fanfare, the hotel receipts, and the visitors, the Centennial also helped restructure the city's politics. The event both cemented networks of alliances among previously divided elites and marked the ascendance of a Republican hegemony in local political culture that would be virtually unchallenged for the next sixty years. The Republican regime that coalesced in the 1870s combined several elements: party bossism centered in control of several city agencies, an electoral machine that came to trade votes for public construction contracts, business support based in ideological solidarity (support for protectionist legislation), and reliance on rail- And port-related industries as the engine of the city's economy. In Philadelphia's case, the irony is that those Republicans who did the most to make the Centennial happen-large, reformist civic organizations like the Union League that played crucial roles in event planning and in promoting commitment to the Republican Party-did not necessarily enjoy the political fruits of their labors. Over time, the elite's cultural and ideological commitment to Republicanism became a straitjacket, and they lost control of the polity they had helped build. More broadly, I use the example of the Centennial to examine the role that cultural projects play in urban governance. These projects, and the planning efforts that produce them, contribute to the emergence and consolidation of governing regimes out of situations of extreme political discord and fragmentation. They connect processes of elite network formation (social capital) and ideological consolidation. These two processes in turn are the building blocks of hegemony in local governance-cultural and social leadership that shapes people's political commitments and the extent to which they are willing to consider or pursue alternatives to prevailing arrangements. © 2006 by Temple University Press.

268,1.0,2006,Editorial,The World Urban Forum III: Vancouver,"""Better information for better cities!"" is the call that leads this special issue. Urban indicators and performance measurement are the answers, aiming to improve local performance on key trends and contribute to solving global problems. Better information, according to the rational model that predominates in urban policy, is the surest path to improve action. The World Urban Forum (WUF) III, meeting in Vancouver in June 2006, considers dimensions, challenges, and practices in the use of urban indicators in the Vancouver region. Patrick Geddes, writing in the early days of the town and regional planning movement, insisted upon the value of what he called a synoptic view, ""a seeing of the city and this as a whole; like Athens from its Acropolis"" (Geddes, 1949, p. 6). Working from a synoptic view did not simply mean gazing down on the city from atop a hill. Geddes strove to help people express ""simultaneity"" of their own being. Understanding that people living in a given region have a multitude of different perspectives, simultaneity of being meant ""one-ness with the social ideals, the scientific developments and the physical conditions of [their] own time and place"" (Geddes, 1949, p. x). He believed a region could be created and planned to aid people in accomplishing all these things. As one of the forefathers of town and regional planning, Geddes himself was a maker of ""great maps and diagrams and charts"" (Geddes, 1949, p. xiii)-but his most lasting contribution to the profession and practice of planning was his notion of the Civic Exhibition. Geddes was less concerned about expert training to make great plans and planners than he was ""concerned that the ordinary citizen should have a vision and a comprehension of the possibilities of his own city"" (Geddes, 1949, p. xi). A periodic Civic Exhibition, during which citizens could gather in a festive atmosphere to peruse plans, gaze at large maps and models, discuss and interpret these publicly, was one part of Geddes's key contribution to this goal. The other part was his drive to create a permanent and public centre for Civic Studies in every town in the form of an ""Outlook Tower""(Geddes, 1949, p. xi). The Outlook Tower was to be the ""incipient Civic Observatory and Laboratory together"" in which the Science of Cities was advanced to its proper rank amongst academic and life pursuits (Geddes, 1949, p. 96). The institution Geddes sought to create placed ""its effort towards correlation of thought and action, science and practice, sociology and morals, with its watchword and endeavour of ""Civic Survey for Civic Service"""" (Geddes, 1949, p. 69). Fastforward to late 2004, when the Urban Studies Program at Simon Fraser University's downtown campus initiated the Regional Vancouver Urban Observatory (RVu), with a vision akin to that of Geddes. In the context of the new millennium, RVu was established as the first local observatory within UN-Habitat's Global Urban Observatory network in a developed country. The Global Urban Observatory was established in 1997 to institutionalize UN-Habitat's pioneering work in the generation and tracking of urban indicators, initiated with the Urban Indicators Programme in 1993. Following the creation of the Habitat Agenda at the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul in 1996, the mission was set for the Global Urban Observatory-to create and maintain a Global Urban Indicators Database that would permit UN member states and their cities to monitor and report on urban trends on a regular and reliable basis. The Millennium Development Goals, established by UN member states in 2000, and the indicators established for tracking these eight goals in 2003, update the mission of the Global Urban Indicators Database (UN-Habitat 2004). The MDGs represent a global compact for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, to be attained by 2015. RVu's work to date is being presented to the international community for the first time at the World Urban Forum III. The work thus far has constituted both expert-based and public participatory components. Experts affiliated with RVu have conducted regional and international research on urban indicator-related work, with some bearing on the Vancouver region and on specific indicators used by a range of projects in the major areas of urban capital: health, economy, environment, governance, culture, and infrastructure. Work in progress toward these research articles was presented at the first RVu public event, Focusing ouR View, in October 2005; and the best finished results are presented in this issue of Cities. Keys to the design of Rvu, and in particular its public participatory process, are presented in the first article in this issue, Urban Indicators and the Integrative Ideals of Cities, by Meg Holden. The paper presents the practice in progress of RVu's stance on urban sustainability as a community-based struggle to learn, indicators as a means for long-term learning, and the role of value-based citizen participation, within a theoretical perspective. Sustainable development, as a framework for long-term planning, has value in the Vancouver region for its ""constructive ambiguity""(Robinson, 2004, p. 374), its pointers toward greater linkages among environmental, social, and economic priorities, without forcing a premature set of quantitative trade-offs. This integrative, vague, idealistic thrust also leaves sustainable development open to clashes with incremental, specific, and realist demands competing for time on the public agenda. Indicators can help bridge the gap; the articles in this issue begin to explain how. One article presents a bridge from the perspective of environmental economics, illustrating the complexities of measuring natural capital but also the need and precedent for this. The next article presents a way of thinking about indicators of governance for sustainable development from a starting point of allocating equal value to democratic inclusion of each citizen. Moving from the individual to the group, the final two articles ask for greater attention to socially, culturally and demographically-specific cases: new immigrants and Aboriginal people. Nancy Olewiler offers an economist's perspective on the design and utility of an urban indicator project, with a particular focus on natural capital. Her article, Environmental Sustainability for Urban Areas: The Role of Natural Capital Indicators, expands on one of the themes from Holden, the difference between descriptive indicators, which proliferate in policy contexts, and diagnostic indicators, which are rare. Olewiler presents the Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and reminds us of the need to consider different indicators at each point in the chain. Her treatment of natural capital indicator issues locally includes useful information on Greater Vancouver's adjacent Fraser Valley Regional District. She looks south to the city of Santa Monica, California for an example of natural capital indicator development and institutionalization. Building on a theme introduced by Holden, Olewiler reminds us that indicators alone are not enough; effective indicators are those presented in a reasoned context with a clear path to actions. Indicators belong at the beginning, not the end, of a good governance process. The next article specifies much more clearly what might be meant by the notion of good governance. In Designing Good Urban Governance Indicators: The Importance of Citizen Participation and its Evaluation in Greater Vancouver, political scientist Kennedy Stewart makes the case for inclusion of governance considerations in any definition of sustainability. The political aspect of sustainability is poorly developed, compared to economic, environmental, and social aspects and this article moves the thinking ahead through treatment of democratic theory, along with work on defining 'good governance' advanced by the United Nations. Stewart draws on evidence of voting patterns in the Vancouver region to raise the spectre of systematic disenfranchisement, that seems to be on the rise. As Canada's only unamalgamated major metropolitan region, led by municipal appointments rather than direct elections, advances in sustainable development policy made by the Greater Vancouver Regional District are at risk if voting trends cannot be reversed. Stewart calls for stepwise moral reasoning, based on the premise of universal equal rights to rectify this wrong. The final two articles examine the limits of belonging to the project of sustainability in the Vancouver region, from the perspective of the region's newest residents and its ancestral residents. Robert Fiedler, Nadine Schuurman and Jennifer Hyndman, in Hidden Homelessness: An Indicator - Based Approach for Examining the Geographies of Recent Immigrants At-Risk of Homelessness in Greater Vancouver, focus on the dimensions of risk of homelessness amongst one particularly vulnerable group, new immigrants. This investigation brings to the fore the interaction of policies, economics, and cultures in explaining the complexities of homelessness and immigration trends in the region. Since about half of the region's population growth in the foreseeable future will come from international immigration, and an increasing proportion of new arrivals face socio-economic difficulties upon arrival, understanding these interactions is key to sustainability in a context of increasing cultural diversity and decreasing affordability of housing. First Nations researcher Nathan Cardinal puts an Aboriginal lens on indicators in his concluding article, The Exclusive City: Identifying, Measuring and Drawing Attention to Aboriginal and Indigenous Experiences in an Urban Context. Along with immigrants, Aboriginal groups constitute fast growing demographic cultural groups in British Columbia.",,Holden M.,10.1016/j.cities.2006.03.002
269,1.0,2005,Conference Paper,Pleasure-based design approaches to the built environment,"As an exercise in discipline cross-fertilisation, this paper applies the emergent practice of pleasure-based approaches in product design to the design of the built environment. This analysis provides insight into humans' emotional responses to the environment that is provided for them. Jordan's four pleasures model, composed of physio-, socio-, psycho- and ideo-pleasures, is used to undertake this analysis. From this analytical process it is evident that physio-, socio- and psycho-pleasures are drawn from generic elements that relate to humans as a kind, and that these commonalities are deeply rooted historical and cultural reference points. Understanding these reference points, and the design principles that emerge from them, will enable those who provide the built environment to engage with the 'super-usability' imperative that these pleasure-based approaches have been drawn from and, in so doing, to develop human-centric solutions that engender positive relationships between people and the environment that is provided for them.

She states that organic sounds created by humans and animals that have always accompanied human civilization helps to understand it. But as the city noise rose with urbanization, people started escaping it. Organizations and commissions were formed to control city noise and to provide a noise-free environment. Modern architects of America constructed the Philadelphia Saving fund Society in 1932 to control sound by acoustically isolating people from the city noise.

272,1.0,2002,Conference Paper,Designing a DNA for adaptive architecture: A new built environment for social sustainability,"The paper explores innovative environmentally responsible and socially proactive ways to build in developing countries. The proposed methodology was tested with the design of a Smart Village in Egypt, awarded the second prize in an international competition. Our design approach is based on environmental and social sustainability and works as a genetic algorithm. This process generates the sustainable architecture of the village using the behaviour of biological creatures in artificial systems. The design ultimately ensures that our architecture is nurtured by renewable energies and built with re-cycled materials. The disposition of public spaces and the flexible organization of different functions are conceived in order to stimulate social sustainability, allowing the community to be interdependent as much as an ecosystem. Local cultures, typologies, materials and climate build the DNA of both the village and its buildings. We apply concepts from artificial life, using ""creatures"" that follow simple low-level rules in order to get high-level group behaviour. By combining the principles of artificial life and architecture, we get both high energy-efficiency and optimal placement of built units on a specific site. As in any ecosystem, a fractal, coherent, continuous fluctuation at every scale of the system is vital, and this kinetic flexibility is achieved at four levels: 1) decentralized urban planning; 2) reconfigurable spaces; 3) modular building blocks; 4) kinetic structures that respond to light, climate and people.",,"Magnoli G.C., Bonanni L.A., Khalaf R.",
274,1.0,1991,Article,The Delhis within Delhi,"Concepts and techniques of human settlements cannot be divided from social and economic realities in which they are located. One of the most important factors is the development of the historical forces. This is shown in the case of Delhi. Today, Delhi is not one single city anymore. Apart from the complexity that all similarly sized urban areas show there are many districts with their unique background, character, personality and culture. To improve living conditions in the old areas of the city, while still retaining their character, the ""conservative surgery' approach may be adopted, rather than extensive re-development schemes. The people for which shelter is designed must be met with confidence and their real participation must be sought. For achieving all this, planning has first to start from outside Delhi, and the National Capital Region plan, the recommendations of the National Commission of Urbanization, and the National Housing Policy all have an impact. In the foreseeable future, Delhi is going to be a city of flats. Maybe this is the only workable solution. To achieve culturally the best results, this kind of development should preferably be done through co-operatives rather than government offices. -from Author",,Chandhoke K.,
275,1.0,1983,Article,MINIMIZING ENERGY DEMANDS IN MEDIUM SIZE CITIES: GLOBAL PROSPECTS.,"Increasing the role of medium size cities is important for future development because: decentralizing urbanization helps reduce pressure on decaying metropolises; they are where people still live in developing countries, and increasingly prefer to live in advanced countries; total economic requirements for infrastructure developments may be lower than that of larger cities; and in general, medium size cities appear to be more manageable for both administrators and residents. Case studies of medium size cities suggest that they also suffer from uncontrolled growth and energy intensive development patterns. On the other hand, aspects of these cities provide examples of efficient development patterns which appear conceptually adaptable to emerging needs. In this paper it is suggested that many of the city patterns in developing countries have evolved to suit conditions of local culture, climate and geographical resources, and provide fruitful ground to derive solutions for future development in both developing and developed countries.",,Gami Bharat M.,
276,,2021,Article,"Neoliberal urban sustainability in Old Kolkata, India: Case studies of contested developments","Neoliberalism, a contemporary form of liberalism, advocates supremacy of market economic valuation in the social choices and decisions. Expectedly the neoliberal political-economic compulsions have opened up scope for capitalistic investment in the city of Kolkata. But, due to lack of decentralized urban facilities and a typical outlook of the people to stay in the “core” area, construction of high-rise buildings replacing the traditional structures and associated cultures in the old and heritage areas is prominent. Cost of living in the urban core has been increasing rapidly due to the advent of the affluent families, having more purchasing power parity; and thus, the people living for generations as old-settlers have to give up their possession of lands to drift towards the peripheries or sustain by compromising their opulence. As observed, the middle-income groups are badly affected by the consequences of post-liberalized developments. This study has been done on the basis of the authors' participant observations, and review of different published literatures to build a theoretical framework, followed by perception surveys of the diverse residents to understand the problem and validate the proposition. It is argued, that unlike the traditional socially clustered neighbourhoods, especially in old Kolkata, the renewed vertical extension of the gated habitations is promoting more social segregations and exclusions in which interdependence and cohabitation in urban governance may not be truly representative, and therefore, unsustainable in future. The research can add significant knowledge in the domain of urban governance and appropriate designing of the cultural cityscape of Kolkata. © 2020 The Author(s).

277,,2021,Conference Paper,The uniformity concept of urban design: Impact of cultural traditions on the meaning of Balinese town,"This study considers the conceptions of religion, tradition, and culture in the urban design process, to produce designs that become the identity of cities in Bali. A socio-semiotic approach is used to explore popular accounts of the conceptions of tradition operating in urban spatial arrangements from historical to contemporary periods. The case study in Gianyar City explores the meaning of urban space based on local wisdom that is still believed by Balinese people. Such exploration provides a basis for reconnecting urban designs with their cultural contexts, thereby promoting spatially expressed localism. Especially for Gianyar City, respect for religious systems, beliefs, and religions that have developed and are highly trusted by the public is expressed in symbolic elements that are embodied in the composition of space, and in fact, give rise to the concept of uniformity. This condition resulted in not achieving a more prominent urban cultural identity and being further damaged by the highly standardized process in the Indonesian planning system. However, the principles of religion and culture that are still alive make Balinese architecture alive, despite changing values, whether we realize it or not. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Mahira E.D., Soemardiono B., Santoso E.B.",10.1088/1755-1315/907/1/012017

283,,2021,Conference Paper,Critical Analysis of Urban Livability Measures Based on the Perspective of Placemaking,"The livability level of an urban area is a substantial measure of one's sense of connection to their neighborhood. Urban livability is often measured based on various measurable aspects such as stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure as stated in EIU's Global Liveability Ranking. However, these indicators often neglect the nature and processes by which places are made that form people's sense of place much more than the physical availability of urban amenities. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the critical perspective and contribution that placemaking brings to the measures of urban livability. This theoretical study analyzes key concepts and frameworks from secondary data such as reports and journal papers with the inductive content analysis method. Through the lens of placemaking principles, the gaps in many urban livability measures are identified. It is proposed that urban livability measure should incorporate placemaking principles of being community-driven, local assets, bottom-up, and trans-disciplinary to enhance the human-environment quality of urban livability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Christy F., Raissa G., Sihotang S., Wijaya K.",10.1088/1755-1315/764/1/012016
284,,2021,Book Chapter,Offending sights and urban governance: Expectations of city aesthetics and spatial responses to the unsightly,"The problem of incivilities seems to be considerably connected to the visibility of unsightly behaviour. Factors such as urban attractiveness and visibility of the homelessness play important roles in urban social control and have led to the sanitisation and gentrification of city centres. Visual exposure is also relevant to how people perceive and respond to crime. In times of Selfie Culture, where it seems particularly important to some people that the background of their image is beautiful and (Insta)grammable, the right to expose one’s unappetising vulnerability (e.g. homelessness) to the public may clash with others’ beliefs in their entitlement to not see anything ugly or with expectations for urban space to be ordered according to mainstream norms of aesthetic acceptability. The chapter, first, addresses the visibility of incivilities, framing the regulation of offending sights within the gaze-dependent culture. Next, it looks at the contemporary urban responses to the vulnerable groups many deem unsightly, focusing in particular on the spatial-defensive measures aimed at removing certain marginal groups, such as the homeless and youth, from urban space. It then critically examines the wider societal and normative implications of such social control. The chapter concludes with some reflections on defensive architecture within securitised society, and policy considerations. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Nina Peršak and Anna Di Ronco.",,Peršak N.,10.4324/9781003092643-5
285,,2021,Article,"The Impact of Ancient Landscape Changes on the City Arrangement of the Early Shang Dynasty Capital Zhengzhou, Central China","Buried underneath modern Zhengzhou city in Henan Province, China, lies the archeological remains of one of the ancient capital cities of the Shang dynasty (1766 – 1122 BCE). Although it is likely that people planned this Shang capital city according to the demands of the surrounding environment, there is no clear relationship between the current environment, such as the hydrology and topography, and the ancient city’s layout. To better understand the relationship between planning principles used during the Shang dynasty and the nearby environment at Zhengzhou, we measured and sampled stratigraphic exposures at excavation locations throughout Zhengzhou. Through these excavations we obtained both absolute and relative chronological data from each culture layer, enabling us to use geospatial interpolation and analysis methods to reconstruct the ancient landscape. The results show that ancient city’s different activity areas had a close relationship with their environmental context. For example, the Shang dynasty palace was located on high ground and workshops were located down below along the courses of ancient rivers. In conclusion, we argue that research that merges geomorphology and archeology is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the development of urban areas. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Lu, Yang, Storozum, Yang, Tian, Wang, Wu, Xu, Wang, Yan and Zhai.",ancient city arrangement; geomorphic evolution; human-environmental interactions; landscape changes; Zhengzhou Shang City,"Chen P., Lu P., Yang S., Storozum M., Yang R., Tian Y., Wang H., Wu Q., Xu J., Wang X., Yan L., Zhai H.",10.3389/feart.2021.656193

We therefore have to rethink how to adopt the seamless integration of sustainable transportation alternatives. Poor maintenance is one of the factors adduced to be responsible for the current deteriorated state of mobility corridors and the existing road infrastructure. Overpopulation and increasing socio-economic activities of Festac Town exerts undue pressure on the infrastructure, thereby accelerating deterioration. The study is underpinned by Eco-mobility principles. This study is aimed at assessing the eco-mobility approach for a sustainable neighbourhood road infrastructure within a mixed-use community. Developing a sustainable mobility strategies that brings the neighborhood streets back to the people is an objective which this study pursue. A multi-staged sampling technique was adopted for the study. On-site qualitative approach was majorly employed through the interviews conducted assessing the major mobility corridors and streets from 1st to 7th avenues. A sample frame of 15 major roads with outdoor open spaces along the selected roads all within the selected avenues and major street roads. The instruments for data collection were oral interviews and personal/physical observations. The activity profiles, locational data and geospatial coordinates of each avenue were imported into ArcGIS (Version 10.5, ESRI) for various land-use analysis. The sustainable eco-mobility strategies will reduce transportation impacts, create civilized streets that meets environmental design standards of commuter's safety and comfort that are compatible with the unique urban structure and culture of metropolitan Lagos. This study evaluated the issues relating to sustainable eco-mobility, the connection between climate change and transportation systems, the impact of urban mobility on public health and wellbeing.

Using “house” as a laboratory and everyday life and spatial relations of residents as a framework of analysis, the paper examines the spatial planning concepts in traditional and contemporary Iranian architecture and the associated socio-cultural practices. Discussions are drawn upon from a pilot study conducted in the city of Kerman, to investigate ways in which contemporary housing solutions can better cater to the continually changing socio-cultural lifestyles of residents. Data collection for the study involved a series of participatory workshops and employed creative visual research methods, participant observation and semi structured interviews to examine the interlacing of everyday socio-spatial relations and changing perception of identity, belonging, socio-cultural and religious values and conflict. The inferences from the study showcases the emerging social and cultural needs and practices of people manifested through the complex relationship between residents, the places in which they live, and its spatial planning and organisation. For a better understanding of this complex relationship, the paper argues the need for resituating spatiality as a socio-cultural paradigm. © 2021 The Author(s).",Architecture; Housing; Iran; Planning; Socio-cultural; Spatial,"Rajendran L., Molki F., Mahdizadeh S., Mehan A.",10.3846/jau.2021.14032
288,,2021,Article,Cognitive-Cultural Looping Mechanism of Urban Space Conceptualization,"A crucial point for urban design is the acknowledgement that urban material structures are not only constituting a set of cognitive-cultural affordances that shapes people’s behavior and experiential world, but likewise that the design process itself is an expression of cultural conceptualizations possibly evoked by ongoing cultural practices and perceptions, thus forming a dynamic loop. In this paper, we outline a framework for the study of material, cultural and social mechanisms interacting with human cognition, behavior and emotions. We attempt a conceptual model that integrates dynamic interactions between cognitive-cultural affordances and our conceptualization of the environment and provides a few illustrative case examples. The model proposes a set of dynamic relations between cognitive and cultural processes at shorter time scales modifying conceptualizations and environmental affordances on longer timescales, while these – in turn – come to guide and constrain processes at the shorter timescales. The model has important implications for our understanding of the role of environmental design, especially urban design, as bridging between aspects of human situated experience, behavior, social and cultural norms and material culture. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Affordance; Cognition; Conceptualization; Human behavior; Urban design,"Alinam Z., Tylén K., Pirbabaei M.T., Gharehbaglou M.",10.1007/s12124-021-09642-8
292,,2021,Conference Paper,Spectacles of the Temporal City: An Analysis of the Effects of Festivals on Identity in an Urban Context,"Cities around the world are becoming complex systems wherein every city possess unique identity manifested through its people and activities that occur in its urban spaces. The sense of urban space is an ever-changing concept and to understand the fabric of urban spaces, knowledge of the concept of space and its interrelations is required. Reading a city in a time where change is the norm, with urban spaces gaining new meanings and functions with changes in cultural practices conveys the hybrid urgencies of metropolitan India. An analysis is thus, particularly relevant in India, as in the post-industrial scenario, cities in India have become some of the largest urban conglomerates with a dualist identity of static and kinetic pervading their urban landscape. The static city is the conventional physical entity of a city whereas, the kinetic city is perceived as a city in motion, temporary in nature and the emerging symbolic image of urban India. Understanding these multitudes of identities in the backdrop of traditional events and festivals, as temporal transformations of urban spaces will thus highlight the dominant visual culture of Indian cities. This Temporal City enables a better understanding of the blurred lines of contemporary urbanism and the changing roles of social space in the urban fabric. This study focused on the ancient festival of Ambubachi in the historic Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, India, through visual ethnography, participant observations, open-ended interviews, photography and document analysis. The central concern of this paper is to develop a critical stance on understanding the identities of cities through the study of urban spectacles such as festivals in a bid to illustrate the fluid and dynamic aspect of one’s identity that is being constantly redefined and reconstructed with time, space, activities and context. Through the analysis of this ancient festival of Ambubachi in the light of ‘identity’ and ‘place attachment’ of the festivalgoers, the emerging notions of identity will be explored. The fieldwork sought to analyse two major aspects: The first was the generic, spatial characteristics of festival spaces and the second was the temporal, fleeting events that occur in their physical settings following the parameters of event-space relationship by Frenchman in a bid to understand how such eventful urban spaces manifest in the negotiation of one’s identity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Festivals; Identity; Place attachment; Place identity; Social space,"Das A., Das A.K.",10.1007/978-981-16-0041-8_61
293,,2021,Article,Inclusive trends of urban development: Temporal-spatial social practices∗,"The article presents the results of a review of the data of Russian and international research of social-urban development as presented at the scientific events in the Saratov region. In contemporary urbanism, there is a number of trends: temporal, of universal design, and social-cultural. The Russian urban development follows agglomeration trends that are increasingly evident in the processes of settlement, which means active development of suburban areas, changes in their landscape characteristics, cultural spaces, and mobility of citizens. The covid-19 pandemic had a complex impact on the social-urban features of cities in Russia and the world by transforming the structure and functionality of many urban locations, creating conditions for the emergence of a post-coronavirus city. The empirical data show that such a city is the most socially sensitive to negative and positive aspects of social life and to manifestations of inclusive practices that unite people. Under the low, fragmented accessibility of social, cultural and other infrastructure of cities that are designed for healthy people, there is a synchronization of urban infrastructure elements in the context of inclusion due to the social demand for a ‘coronavirus transformation’ of the architectural and urban environment in terms of social distancing. Based on the research data from different regions of Russia, the authors identify priority directions of the inclusive development of social urbanism: models of the inclusive culture of urban communities; monitoring of the city accessible environment for citizens of different age and mobility (in particular, with the ‘tracing’ and ‘walk along’ approaches); model of participatory urban planning and social expertise of the inclusiveness of the urban space; educational model of professional training in the field of social urbanism and universal design. © D.V.

These forms include seemingly non-organized online groups, which can be easily dismissed as informal chatter. Building on communicative theories of organizing and Luhmann’s Theory of Social Systems, we explore the communicative organizationality of a Facebook group related to urban planning. By analyzing private chat logs of the group administrators, we explore the group’s organizationality and the ways in which organizational and interactional communication become intertwined to produce and curate digital political discussions. Our findings illustrate how technological affordances built for moderation also support the strategic organization of discussions to orchestrate political talk. We conceptualize such operations as discursive conditioning of organizational interaction and suggest that political action online can be propelled not only by connecting people, but also by the powerful yet concealed tactic of conditioning public online discussions. © 2021 The Author(s).

295,,2020,Conference Paper,"The houses for music - Concept and place. Modern tendencies, author’s own experience","The subjects of this dissertation are buildings intended for music and their role in urban space. Houses for music – that is how we can briefly name buildings whose basic function is listening to music in the form of a concert - Philharmonic buildings. Also in the form of a show or performance fused with music. The third function of such buildings is to ensure the possibility for people to meet, adding certain nobility to the event in question, and therefore, added nobility to the venue itself. This last function is gaining significance. It is accompanied by the phenomenon of identifying the event as the function itself and simultaneously identifying the site. The growing value of such places stems from the oldest concept of urban planning, in search for that ‘modernity‘of the 20th century, an idea which has been forgotten and is now going through its revival. As Jan Gehl, an urban expert and humanist, reminds us, referring to the’city for people’. He reminds us that the number and the quality of the places are of utmost importance – places which create the occasion to participate in the urban membrane. The need for meeting builds the identity of a place, connecting cultural ideas with concepts which create culture and put architecture and music in the centre. The sound of the music itself becomes an element of the identity, the sound – however invisible, is very important for the place – on equal rights with the architecture of the designed buildings. The sound facilitated in the designs of these buildings creates the final quality of the architecture of the opera house or the Philharmonic. The dualism of the architectural and musical thought in the creation of the concept played a decisive role in creating the functionality of the venue, creating the true value of the place. It becomes a highly significant element of the quality of urban space. This short musing shows us that architecture and music are linked inter-disciplinarily as an important or perhaps even basic material for these buildings. The increasing significance of the relation between the buildings intended for music with the social strata of the city is very much visible in contemporary architectural concepts.The subject of this dissertation is the architectural concept and the context of buildings intended for music in urban space. This topical question has been presented on the basis of the following: The majority of the presented examples have been researched in situ by the author of the article.Historical thoughts presented based on the venues in Milan and New York, namely the La Scala and Carnegie Hall.

It is well-known that many cities around the world have been impacted by western urban planning models but, curiously no comprehensive comparative study of these influences has so far been attempted. This essay stems from 5 years of teaching and research in the field of urban history and presents a series of examples from non-western contexts such as India, China, Africa, South America, and elsewhere to showcase the direct or indirect impact of several western urban planning models. The aim is to analyse how differently these models, such as the English garden city, Le Corbusier’s plan voisin concept, and Haussmann’s plan for Paris have been adopted by a number of non-western cities and the degree to which they have been transformed by local contexts. Indeed, frequently, the original concept of the exported model has been completely modified. The essay also identifies those western urban models which have spread most widely. There are, indeed, a series of western models which have proved more popular than others and it is worth attempting to understand why they have proved to be so. © 2020, The Author(s).",Cultural exchange; Migration; Planning; Urban; Western models,Guerrieri P.M.,10.1186/s40410-020-0113-0
299,,2020,Conference Paper,The outstanding universal value of the historic colonial centre of the city of gracias (Honduras),"This paper analyses the outstanding universal values, integrity, and authenticity of the city of Gracias (Honduras), as well as its protection and heritage management tools. The main objective is to demonstrate that Gracias meets the UNESCO requirements to qualify as a candidate for inclusion in the International List of the World Heritage Convention (1971). Gracias is a colonial Spanish city, founded in 1536, in the region of Lempira. It had great productive, strategic and administrative importance in Central America, demonstrated in part by its hosting of the 'Audiencia de los Confines'. The 'Audiencia' was the highest court of the Spanish Crown with jurisdiction over the current republics of Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and the region of Chiapas. The aim of this court was to represent the interests of the indigenous people in these areas. An on-site analysis, diagnosis and assessment of the heritage elements was carried out from architectural, urban planning, historical, and intangible heritage perspectives. Additionally, other similar sites in Central America have been analysed for comparison. Results show that this city meets criterion iv of the World Heritage Convention: 'an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates (a) significant stage(s) in human history'. Furthermore, the city´s heritage assets are well-preserved and most of them remain functional; the indigenous culture is alive; and planning, conservation and managing tools are in use. Currently, Gracias maintains its harmony and life and its respect for the natural environment, creating a cultural landscape that has been maintained for almost 500 years. © Authors 2020.

300,,2020,Article,"The relation between shoppers and different designs of commercial spaces; A humanistic approach, Irbid city as a case study","The development and implementation of urban planning is the fundamental basis for the construction and management of the city and its space, to ensure effective allocation of resources and the rational use of the land. And while the city is considered one of the most important means of accomplishing economic and social development goals, this paper argues that urban planning affects the relationship between the city and the city's people as well as the development of its commercial growth. This study aims to research and compare the advantages and the disadvantages between the shops opened directly to a street and the shops opened to a plaza (the pedestrian mall) in Irbid city downtown. The study has focused on the identification of architectural and urban patterns and the artistic aspects of urban design. Conversely, this research aims to identity the needs of the users by introducing the hypothesis that the behavioral patterns in any designed space relies on the designers personal perceptions and understanding of the behavioral and usage patterns of the individuals within it, the understanding of which positively reflects on both the spatial qualities and the individual's perception of it. The questions of this research are as follows: (1) What is the role of the design of the commercial shops in creating a sense of pleasure and safety in the downtown of Irbid city? (2) How do shops play out their role in the growth and expansion of commercial development? Through visual survey and the analytical studies of the GIS data, the research determines an overall preference of one of the market-space designs. The results show that shops which are opened to a plaza are vital in giving a sense of security and integrity to the concept of the downtown commercial area, it also provides organization among the different parts of the commercial area and plays two important roles: (1) they interconnect the different parts of the city's physical structure; and (2) the vital role of the city's economic and social life. In conclusion, this paper offers recommendations for the redesign and development of the building's regulations in the downtown to achieve the proper relationship between urban planning and urban development, deal with the modern city development and reflect the relationship with its own culture. © 2020 WITPress.

301,,2020,Article,"Of pirate drivers and honking horns mobility, authority, and urban planning in late-colonial accra","This article attempts to bridge two literatures—the African history of urban life and the colonial history of urban planning—in order to better understand the politics of African mobility. In doing so, it situates colonial histories of urban planning and emerging African cultures of auto-mobility within a broader critique of colonial technology and infrastructure. This article argues that the realities of indirect rule—the autonomy of African urban residents and the weakness of colonial authority and infrastruc-ture—raised new questions and problems for colonial officials who were tasked with turning ideology into policy and practice. In particular, mobility politics allow us to trace the way that “average” people negotiated colonial politics within and outside of the formal, elite structures of elected Town Councils, Legislative Assembles, or chieftaincy politics. Within the colonial bureaucracy and the Town Council, African elites negotiated their own prestige and status alongside the interests and demands of the city’s lower-and middle-class populations. © 2020 by the Society for the History of Technology.

302,,2020,Article,Research progress and implication of the“neural turn”in human geography,"Neuroscience is the science of the 21st century. The theoretical research results of neuroscience are affecting daily life, environment, space, context, and place profoundly. It provides a new way of thinking and method to explain human's mind and behavior. In the context of post- modernism, the understanding of selfconsciousness in human geography has become fragmented. Non- presentation theory and embodied cognitive geography claim that in most of the time, people are ""unconscious"". Subject self- consciousness is irrational, which takes place in the ""outflows"" daily life world. It emphasizes the showing, performance, and practice of the body. The meaning of the real world should be obtained through embodied cognition and behavior. They found evidence from neuroscience that led to a ""neural turn"" in geography. The ""neural turn"" devotes to linking human's mind and behavioral traits to biological evidence. It is different from inter-disciplinary debates that are breaking down the disciplinary boundaries between social culture and natural sciences. The laboratory methods cannot reflect the real world, and the social science methods are difficult to get rid of subjective factors. The ""neural turn"" can provide a research perspective of combining the-first-person and the-third-person for human geography. This article reviewed the recent studies on the ""neural turn"" in Western human geography. ""Neural turn"" research mainly concentrated in three aspects: Space perception, embodied affect, and behavior practice. It has involved economic, political, social, cultural, public policy, tourism, and education topics. The application of neuroscience in human geography can also be applied to multiple scales of space such as country, city, community, and body. Neuroscience perspective as a new path is used in urban planning, environmental design, tourism development, and public policy, among others. At the same time, the technical tools of neuroscience have become new data collection methods in human geography. Neural technology can capture imperceptible physiological changes in the human body in order to detect neural activity caused by mind and behavior in a particular environment and context. The collection of physiological data can surmount the representation of text and symbols to discover non- representational results. Brain images and eye tracking technologies have been applied in geography, presenting predictable visions for the future. At present, Chinese human geography pays little attention to neuroscience. This article is hoped to provide some reference and enlightenment for the study of Chinese human geography. The dialogue between neuroscience and human geography is still in its infancy and needs more empirical research. In this process, human geography can carry out more cooperative research to produce more knowledge spillover. At the same time, these studies need to explore the topic of Chinese localization in order to better realize the people- oriented approach in the research and application of Chinese human geography. © 2020, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

303,,2020,Article,Alterlivability speculative design fiction and the urban good life in starhawk's fifth sacred thing and city of refuge,"This article responds to two diverging notions of “livability”: the normative New Urbanist imaginary of livable cities, where the urban good life manifests in neoliberal consumer cultures, green gentrification, and inaccessible infrastructures, and the feminist and disability concept of livable worlds, such as those in which nonnormate life thrives. Whereas the former ought to broaden its notion of “lives worth living,” the latter would benefit from a more specific theory of design-the making and remaking of more livable worlds. In response, this article offers the concept of “alterlivability,” a design philosophy grounded in permaculture ethics. Drawing on two novels by ecofeminist writer Starhawk-The Fifth Sacred Thing (1994) and City of Refuge (2016)-the article explores the genre of speculative design fiction for its insights into prototyping more livable futures in the Anthropocene. Starhawk's novels illustrate alterlivability as a set of political commitments, design methodologies, and spatial forms that place disabled, racialized, and poor people at the center of alterlivable worlds. © 2020 Aimi Hamraie",Disability; Livability; Permaculture; Prototyping; Speculative fiction; Sustainability; Urban design,Hamraie A.,10.1215/22011919-8623197
304,,2020,Article,"New strategies for historical towns in the South of Italy. Rethinking values, physical constraints, and technological opportunities","The hinterland of central and southern Italy and the Islands is interspersed with mostly neglected architectural and urban heritage. These territories present many infrastructural, orographic, and economic constraints. A survival economy had survived, strongly tied to their productive, physical, and cultural identity. New models of the economy (sustainable, responsible, circular, green, sharing, and low-cost models) and new instances in the field of architecture and urban planning (accessible and inclusive spaces built for people) are certainly more appropriate for the reinterpretation of towns with a strong historical connotation: their characteristics are closer to a culture of quality, identity, slowness, without renouncing centrality, something that digital and internet connections allow despite the physical distance. A careful study of these places shows the recurrence of considerable constraints that can no longer be considered impossible. New technologies (digital, domotic, wireless, urban vehicle concepts, etc.) and the 4.0 revolution in the industrial field, which implies the use of enabling technologies, none of which requires physical proximity, support us in the study of specific compatible solutions for the reuse of urban and building heritage. © 2020 Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria.

305,,2020,Article,Ecology of the body and new geography of cities [Écologie du corps et nouvelle géographie des villes],"For a long time, geography ignored the body. It is omnipresent in the landscape of cities. It influences the organization of their spaces. Its pressure on urban power is accentuated by the recent development of a very lively corporeal ideology that is favorable both to the exhibition of bodies and to various playful and sporting activities. Urban authorities provide answers to townsfolk's corporeal aspirations. Cities open themselves and tool up in order to welcome cohorts of walkers, joggers, skaters, rollers, and bicycle-riders. Cars recede in front of public transport that aggregates bodies. The least free spaces turn into corporeal expression areas: squares, sidewalks, gardens and parks welcome languid, indolent, agile, or hurried bodies, and sometimes also the bruised bodies of homeless people. A survey conducted in Bordeaux sheds light on this body culture. It argues in favor of the idea that this new ethos has become a political force filling the vacuum left by a local democracy that is struggling to emerge. © 2020 Societe Geographique de Liege.

309,,2020,Article,Re-locating the identity of Amman’s city through the hybridization process,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define the identity, city identity and architectural identity; to review, analyze and synthesize different pieces from literature to explore and define the factors that shape the city identity; to define the strategies of hybridization process that can be used to re-locate (re-define) the city identity; to examine the most effective factors that shape the identity of Amman city from various perspectives, to examine the relationships/interrelationships between all the factors that shape any city identity from the designers’ perspective, finally, to apply the strategies of hybridization process to re-locate (re-define) Amman’s city identity. Design/methodology/approach: This research used two research methods to collect data as follows: literature review, content analysis and face-face questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the most effective factors that shape the Amman’s identity from different perspectives. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (Pearson r) was computed to assess the relationships between all factors that shape the identity of any city from the perspective of Jordanian designers and experts. Findings: This research concluded that the factors that shape the city identity are cultural factors (socio-cultural, historical, economical and globalization factors), environmental factors (geographic, climate and building materials factors) and urban and architectural factors (spatial design organization, architectural style, open spaces and parks, urban structure factors). Additionally, the six urban development factors that responsible for the hybridization process in a city are new architectural typology and new special configuration, urban edges and hybrid textures, public hybridization open spaces, roads highway-scapes, urban redevelopment through super sites by star architects and downtown urban developments. This research found that there are different perspectives about the definition and factors that shape the identity of Amman’s city because of differences in cultures, experiences, knowledge, education level and personal preferences. The city identity is not a constant concept. It is changed according to time, place, people, culture, global trends, economic status and experience. Moreover, the correlation results revealed that the relationships/interrelationships between all the factors that shape the identity of any city have strong/very strong positive linear associations and significant relationships (r > 0.89). Practical implications: Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) should provide a vision to redefine the identity of Amman city and control over the development pressure, built form and image of the city. This vision should be based on research, analysis and adoption of the most effective road map. GAM and all stakeholders should establish and enforce using specific architectural styles, urban design guidelines, building codes, policy tools and land use regulations to re-define the city identity. GAM should review, assess, approve and supervise all development projects through all design and construction phases especially in sensitive areas. GAM should focus on building capacity, empower its architects and planners, and re-organize (re-structure) their units and administrations especially planning and licensing departments to improve the city image and guide development. This research recommended that architects should design new, diverse and innovative architectural concepts, typologies and spatial configurations. Rapid development and new edges should be planned, designed and managed from the parts to the whole. The heterogeneous landscape and everyday activities will improve the vitality of urban and open public spaces and form of public culture. Architects and star architects ought not to make a clear and sharp separation between old and new development, architectural styles and typologies. Architects and urban designers ought to design hybrid physical urban environments, urban morphology, urban multi-functional activities, mix-use buildings, open spaces for social life, street patterns and furniture, squares, architectural style and typologies, spatial connectivity, green spaces and landscape entities. The designers and planners should consider how to create a city for living, working and recreation. Originality/value: This research defined the identity, city identity, architectural identity and the factors that may shape the city identities. This research proposed and used the hybridization process as a tool to re-locate (re-define) the identity of Amman city and any city to be more obvious. Additionally, this research examined the relationships/interrelationships between the factors that shape the city identity. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Architectural identity; City identity; Hybrid design,"Alhusban A.A., Alhusban S.A.",10.1108/JPMD-07-2019-0066
310,,2020,Book Chapter,Universal Design in Sustainable Urban Planning,"There is a fil rouge connecting Universal Design and sustainability which within the Brundtland Report can be recognized in the pillar of social sustainability. The demographic and epidemiological aspects that are affecting western countries, the definitions of health and healthy cities given by the World Health Organization and the international documents dealing with sustainable development oblige building designers and urban planners to reconsider their social role and become “health operators”. The strict link between human beings and the built environment underlined both by Universal Design and International Classification of Functioning is the reasons why our cities and settlements need high quality urban spaces in order to enhance everyday life social dimension. Three urban projects in Manhattan, Den Haag and Copenhagen will be presented to show how sustainable urban planning can promote social interaction and inclusion, cohesion of communities, human health and well-being, cultural expression and dialogue among a wide diversity of people and cultures. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Arenghi A.,10.1007/978-3-030-41072-8_6
311,,2020,Book Chapter,Introduction,"The Warsaw Housing Cooperative (â€˜Å»oliborz republicâ€™) is a historic example of an attempt to replace the extensive system of representative democracy and majority rule with the principles of direct democracy and the self-governance of various entities/subjects, an example of creating a commons based on biopolitical production of customs, norms, tastes, principles of cooperation and, finally, subjectivity. A common good produced and distributed contrary to the logic of capital in a modern city, at a time it was desperately lacking its resources. The cooperativeâ€™s ambition was to show people how to live and to turn (passive) residents into (active) citizens. Soon, the cooperativeâ€™s founders have transpired to beâ€”as we would now sayâ€”activists, or critical spatial practitioners (Markus Miessen), and the development became a laboratory for modernist urban planning practices. What began as an estate for working-class residents, thanks to the involvement of intellectuals keen on the concept of â€˜sociology in actionâ€™, saw the introduction of numerous experimental forms of urban communal living. An analysis of this historical case relates to questions often posed today by both the urban grass-roots movements and researchers such as David Harvey and Andy Merrifield: Who owns the city? Who does the city belong to? Who should manage the city and how? The performative perspective allows me to see â€˜architecture in actionâ€™ and dwelling as a process, rather than a form. The resident-turned citizen can be seen as engaged in subversive and freedom-oriented undertakings (social, political, economic and educational). In turn, the critical perspective (inseparable from the performative one) revealed the extraordinary power of rebellion and the desire for change resulting from the combination of thought and action, thanks to culture understood as praxis. I assume that the WHC residentsâ€™ strategies, described in this book, may prove valuable particularly today, when modern cities are implementing a model of governance based on urban entrepreneurship, while local governments are eager to dismantle the municipal social welfare system, privatise public goods and collective consumption and cooperate with private investors more often than with residents. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Criticism of modernity; Performative perspective; Preposterous history; Urban studies; Utopian studies,Matysek-ImieliÅ„ska M.,10.1007/978-3-030-23077-7_1

Imagining and designing urban environments where all people thrive is an extraordinary task, and in this compelling narrative, Cushing and Miller remind us that theory is a powerful starting point. Drawing on international research, illustrated case studies, personal experiences, as well as fascinating examples from history and pop culture, this practical book provides the reader with inspiration, guidance and tools. The first section outlines six critical theories for contemporary urban design - affordance, prospect-refuge, personal space, sense of place/genius loci, place attachment, and biophilic design. The second section, using their innovative 'theory-storming' process, demonstrates how designers can create great places that are inclusive, sustainable, and salutogenic.

315,,2019,Conference Paper,Contributions for the Rehabilitation of the Castro da Senhora do Bom Sucesso-Mangualde (Portugal),"Portugal is undoubtedly, a destination for the practice of Nature Tourism, containing a vast and rich natural, historical and cultural heritage. This settlement, Castro of Senhora do Bom Sucesso is a place where the surrounding landscape stands out with several mountains around it, in an environment where the flora and fauna, characteristics of this region, stand out. The whole history of the place, refers to a certain period of the past, valuing it and able to make the experience that the Nature Tourism can provide even better. Being one of the highest places in the central region of Portugal, it is for many people, a special place of enjoyment and relaxation. In this place, hundreds of years ago, there were between 80 and 100 houses of ancient people from the Celtic culture. Later, due to the abandonment by Men, these houses became disused, falling into a rapid decay process with the collapse of walls and roofs, making the roads impassable and the place covered with vegetation. Thus, in this work, in methodological terms, based on literature review, the collection of cartographic elements of the place, and in the field and cabinet studies, it was possible to develop an investigation on the Military Heritage of the region, in order to analyze in detail, the relation of the nature of the place with the architecture. This work resulted in a proposal for the site of the former Castro do Bom Sucesso, with the main objective of creating an Ecotourism Park, around the Celtic culture and autochthonous nature, organized in the following main equipment: I) Reception of the Ecotourism Park; (ii) ""Celtic Bungalows"" iii) Celtic Interpretation Center; iv) biological pool and v) Camping.

316,,2019,Conference Paper,Studies on reconstruction of the Holy Cross wooden church in Wodzisław Śląski,"Wooden churches used to commonly appear in Silesia through the past centuries. Their location was the result of local people's needs and the accessibility of materials necessary to construct them. The form and the nature of those churches were the fruit of intermingling influences of various national cultures of the inhabitants of those areas, craftsmanship experience of various structure builders and depended on the extent of wealth of the cities, towns and villages they were erected in. Wodzisław Śląski was among the places with wooden sacred objects, in the 19th century, it was a small town with population consisting mainly of Poles, Germans and Jews.The Holy Cross wooden church was a hospital object. The church itself was situated on top of a low hill with a brook flowing in its direct vicinity. In the periods of heavy rainfalls, the rapid stream used to wash out the hill, thus, affecting the church foundations, directly contributing to deterioration of the structure's technical condition. The critically bad condition of the church structure was the main reason for the decision to pull it down after 1826. Throughout the recent years, the growth of the local patriotism induced the interest in the town's history and its historical panorama. Relatively few pieces of information on the church and no drawings thereof have been preserved. The archeological and architectural research revealed a lot of interesting facts related to the church and concerning its structure and its supposed non-typical form. A realistic method to satisfy the curiosity how the church looked like in the period of its splendor was the construction of its model based on the research and studies carried out, the very construction of the miniature model in progress being a test site verifying some suppositions about the church's appearance. The model built was added to the exhibits of the Wodzisław Śląski Museum, becoming a contribution to the discussion on methods of the dissemination of information on the historical view of the town and including the research results in the papers concerning the future form and the panorama of modern Wodzisław Śląski. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Pocisk-Dobrowolski J.,10.1088/1757-899X/603/4/042020
317,,2019,Conference Paper,From stone masonry to emigrant's mansions. Changes in vernacular architecture in central Portugal,"The research made for this purpose was realized to study the connection between the way of life, the climate, the geology and the vernacular architecture in the parish of Cernache do Bonjardim, municipality of Sertã, central region of Portugal, where various styles of rural houses can be found. The traditional rural home of this territory is constituted by stone walls, mostly made of shales or granite and has two floors: a lower floor with a place for animals or food storage, and an upper floor with the kitchen/living-room and bedrooms. Usually, both floors are joined by outside stairs. Each available space, for instance under these stairs, is used to keep animals like swine or hens, goats or rabbits, and to store food. Usually there is a piece of ground around the house used for the plantation of vegetables and fruit trees. This kind of home is adapted to the people's way of living and the climate, using local materials like stone or wood. In the 19th century there was an emigration wave to Brazil. When the people returned they wanted to show their acquired richness and (sometimes) culture to the neighbours in the village and constructed large houses of mansion-type, which didn't show the strong adaption to the environment anymore, but had other functionalities and a better comfort. As the transportation means improved, the building material was no more limited to the local offer. The emigration from the sixties of the 20th century until today brought new kinds of buildings. Their style was influenced from the country of emigration. There is no more relation to the local style of building. For the construction, modern materials like concrete, tile walls and roof tiles are used. The major conclusions of the research are that the vernacular architecture of the studied region has changed from houses adapted to the climate and the rural way of life, to larger and no more ""typical"" buildings. The main reasons for this change are the return of emigrants from abroad and its influence, the availability of new materials, the better education and income of the people, the wish to life more comfortably, and the change of the people's way of life from farming to employment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Marcal Goncalves M., Teresa Perez Cano M., Rosendahl S.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/2/022064
318,,2019,Conference Paper,Identity construction of the European medium sized city through the monasticism repercussions in Écija,"The monasticism appeared during the dawn of Christianity has made a major contribution to Europe's culture and identity. The spread of Christian faith throughout the continent was achieved not only through a new morality and religion but also through art and convent architecture. The Middle Ages were the peak of this monastic production. Orders such as Cistercians or Dominicans would appear mainly in France and Italy spreading their rules and ways of life to the whole continent. It is a phenomenon that transcends borders, kingdoms and geographical elements, bringing together many people under the same identity. The flag of the Latin cross waved in the European Middle Ages. However, the reality in southern Iberian Peninsula was different. Al-Andalus stood as a bastion of Islam in Europe long before the appearance of the Ottoman Empire. At the end of the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Castile began to occupy territories held by the Muslim Kingdom of Granada. The need to Christianise the new conquered lands would call a multitude of monastic orders settled in Europe to focus their attention on the new Kingdom of Seville. The main cities such as Seville, Cordoba, etc. would be the most coveted for the new foundations. Nevertheless, Écija is located in the Guadalquivir river valley in a difficult position on the border with the Kingdom of Granada. In the 14th Century, Écija had close to 10, 000 inhabitants, which, at the time, was a large number. A city which was an attraction point for Christian Communities, which according to their origin, 31% came from Italy, 22% from France, 37% from Spain and 10% from Jerusalem. The study of Écija shows the crossing of continental relationships through monasticism. How could the influence of Christianity manage to cover an entire continent to the most remote place? We could find the keys to understand the urban construction of western monasticism through the main average conventual cities in Andalusia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ostos-Prieto F.-J., Costa Rosado A., Aladro-Prieto J.-M., Perez-Cano T.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/2/022053
319,,2019,Conference Paper,Visitors Voice in Historic Sites Interpretation Centres in Bahrain,"Throughout the past decade, a number of site interpretation centres, such as site museums, visitor centres, site exhibits, have grown in Bahrain, a country that is seeking international recognition through culture. This specific typology of museums intends to explain the nearby historical site through the use of multiple interpretation strategies. Understanding the visitors' expectations is an important component in the success of cultural institutions. Exploring the components of a visitor experience and expectations within site interpretation centres has, so far, received limited attention. Hence, this research intends to analyse the visitors' experience and expectations in a specific site interpretation centre in Bahrain: Qalat al Bahrain Site Museum. The visitor's experience and expectations were assessed through two streams of feedbacks. First, an analysis of the comments recorded on the visitors' book. These comments addressed the visitors' reflections, expectations, experiences, and the type of activities undertaken within the premises. Second, the online TripAdvisor from 169 valid returns, 200 TripAdvisor comments and an overview of the visitors' written comments, different types of emotional and spiritual experience expectations were extracted for further analysis... In parallel, this research analysed visitors' behaviour through observation inclusive of different timings during the day and during the year to understand the impact of climatic condition on the visitors' experience and expectations for validation purposes. Finally, some related scholarship discussions and suggestions were proposed based on visitors voice and reflection underlining the reasons why people choose to visit site interpretation centres with reference to personal and social demands. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Al-Saffar M., Anissa Tabet Aoul K.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/5/052006
320,,2019,Conference Paper,South Chile - Extreme Architecture,"Typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions on the one hand, and the lack of roads due to the inaccessibility of mountain areas and the extended coastline, combined with the harsh climate of both hot and polar, on the other, make designing and building in Chile an extreme task. It is and always was also hard to design and build in Chile due to the isolation of this country from the rest of the South American continent thanks to the difficulty to overcome the barrier formed by the Andes. Can these unique conditions be used to create a unique architecture that brings new qualities to global heritage? Perhaps all these ""threats"" are also a significant potential for creation, using beautiful landscapes and pure nature. In the beginning, there was the Word. Architectural culture requires faith and extreme sacrifice. For this reason, the presentation begins with a project to which its architects devoted their lives and decided to become men of the cloth. Buildings devoted to religious worship often exceed the utilitarian dimension of architecture, becoming the determinants of directions that architecture will follow. An example of this heroic expression of architecture is the construction of the Benedictine Church in Les Condes, a suburb of Santiago, in 1962-1964. Can Theatre be a cure allowing people to overcome trauma? The programme of reconstruction of the city of Concepción in Chile after the destruction wrought in 2010 by the tsunami, included not only the restoration of previously existing housing and infrastructural functions, but also the introduction of new cultural function. In 2011, an architectural competition for the design of the Regional Theatre was announced, which was won by three Chilean architects Smiljan Radić, Eduardo Castillo and Gabriela Medrano. The building was put into use in 2018 and is not only a monument of the past, but also a sign of a new beginning (Figure 1). One of Chile's greatest natural resources is its diverse landscape. Difficult accessibility of many areas, low population density and unfavourable climate are the main factors that have caused large areas of land to remain in their natural state. Along with the development of society and the popularisation of tourism, a need arose to build the right background for exploring these natural values. The history tourism in extreme conditions is not long. In Poland, for example, it dates to 1850, when the first winter expedition to the Valley of Five Ponds in the Tatra Mountains took place. In Chile, the first tourist expedition to Patagonia took place in 1879 and was described in the book by its organiser and participant, Lady Lorance Dixie (Dixie, 1880). These extremely hard natural conditions have created a unique opportunity to create modern architecture in interaction with the natural landscape. We will examine this problem on the example of 5 hotels and 5 ways of interacting with the landscape and study these architectural ideas. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Butelski K.,10.1088/1757-899X/603/2/022047
321,,2019,Conference Paper,Experiential Learning for Seismic Protection Using Living Lab Approach in Romania,"The purpose of the research: The paper is going to present the role of seismic areas as living labs/natural laboratories for studying the behavior of buildings and of people and establishing a relationship between a research, a training-education and a knowledge dissemination. The results materialized by experiential actions to reduce negative impacts of disasters are highlighted. Methodology: Engineering learning from earthquakes, based on a long-term seismic culture, became a continuous activity based on field observation, since more than a century. On the other hand, creating earthquake disaster prevention awareness and disaster preparedness can be achieved nowadays by education and active learning addressed to all levels of population, from elder generations to the younger ones, and from usual people to the representatives of authorities. The link between these two approaches is becoming more and more necessary in the context of high local seismicity: investigating the behavior of people, while using emerging technologies (computer-generated imagery, immersive virtual reality etc.), to obtain an active individual attitude. The general concept of awareness and preparedness trends evolved. To deal with earthquake-related situations, people are taught to take measures to prevent severe earthquakes effects, but we must take a step forward to get closer to the system that includes: research knowledge, innovation, GIS and specialized software, and more importantly, the access to all of these, through public and private involvement. Conclusions: The Vrancea seismic zone of Romania, as a natural laboratory, involves us with knowledge and individual perception and attitudes and we have time for improved engineering codes, exploring and experiencing some new learning modalities, refining new policies and regulations from this field, new scenarios for implementation of disaster measures. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Dobre D., Sorin Dragomir C., Georgescu E.-S.",10.1088/1757-899X/603/2/022020
322,,2019,Article,Une ville des jardins: The consiglio d’ornato and the urban transformation of nice (1832-1860),"This article examines the urban transformation of Nice in the early nineteenth century. It does so using the papers of the Consiglio d’Ornato (1832-1860), an urban planning committee charged with overseeing the development of the city at a time of demographic and economic growth brought about by tourism. This article argues that the Consiglio cooperated with private speculators to create a city rooted in a series of myths—Orientalist, Greco-Roman, and early Christian—that both shaped and were shaped by the expectations of world-wearied tourists. Nice was turned into a commodity whose purpose was to provide tourists with a feeling of fleeing a modern world characterized by instability and inauthenticity. Paradoxically, as a direct result, Nice became one of the earliest cities to experience a modern form of consumer capitalism in which people, places, cultures, and nature itself were packaged and peddled to the leisured classes. © The Author(s) 2018.",France; Nice; Nineteenth century; Tourism; Urbanism,Moak D.G.,10.1177/0096144218768499
323,,2019,Article,Olympic games a sustainable design assessment for host location,"Through decades, Olympic Games have become the most spectacular public culture event in modern days. Every four years the Games capture our attention to a grand festive that fascinates millions of people. Accordingly, when a city decides to make a bid, all its concerns is much more captivated by the urban transformation impact on the city whether it's a positive or a negative one. As a result, several factors, if not well-organized and taken into consideration in the strategic development plans of the host cities, may be a burden on the city. Site selection for the event is considered one of the main critical decisions to assure the possibility of the host of the Games by the city. Therefore, this paper reviews several case studies that proved its success in location choice under the delivery of sustainable urban design and strategic planning for the host city. It attempts to mention the main urban design elements affected by the preparation process. Consequently, an urban design sustainable assessment will be developed highlighting both the main urban design factors affected due to the host of the Olympic Games and, the main sustainable key factors affected by the urban changes on site. © 2019, Cairo University.

325,,2019,Article,Man-environment relationship of public square case study in dutch square melaka,"The square is one of the major constituent element of open public space in urban design. It is seen as the core of a city which functions as a focal point in the public space network, providing a space for the community social interaction. However, many of the new public spaces in the 20th century has been a void setting and unsuccessful to create a public open space for social interaction that is vibrant with life. The notion of square was adopted from the European culture as far back as 17th century and has been adapted in Malaysia. This could be seen in today’s square design in Malaysia. However, the behaviour pattern indicate otherwise as the present day square design does not respond to the local climatic context with lack of shaded areas. Hence, people tend to avoid social interactions in public square during daytime due to undesirable weather condition. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the positive aspects of traditional square that has been successful in supporting the community social interaction, and establishing a general guide for the design of new square as a public open space in Malaysian context. Amongst the consideration to be derived from this adaption is the Malaysian local context in terms of historical significance, culture and climate. Dutch Square in Melaka Historical Town was chosen as the case study, because it represents a model of traditional square as a public open space that still functions in term of attracting people to this day. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches were used in this study. Behavioral mapping allowed for statistical analysis where as observation and still photography as the descriptive to support the outcome of behavioural mapping. Therefore, the data collected are more reliable and able to be cross checked for further examinations of the findings. Findings showed that the relationship of the urban context and social behaviour are associative with one another. The square plays an important role to provide a setting in the built environment and the behaviour pattern and activities to determine the success of the square as an open public space. The aim is to provide an appropriate public open space in the built environment that is robust and meaningful to the community. © BEIESP.",Behaviour; Landscape; Man-environment; Public Square,"Jie T.K., Ja’Afar N.H.",
326,,2019,Conference Paper,The Remains of the Bridges,"Bridges are often perceived as a determinant of progress and engineering skills and a symbol of economic potential. The potential of people, city or country - the place where they were created. Therefore, many such bridges have become very important buildings in their cities. They were important both to their originators and promoters, creators and users and to the places themselves that were in some way co-created. For the authors, the city wasn't and isn't just an urbanized space, which was created at a specific time and location, yielding to the processes of development, transformation and even devaluation. The city is an expression of spatially realized ideas and decisions made in the field of urban and social development. It was and still is a place of exchange of thought and civilization development, reflecting the ambitions, aspirations and diverse cultures of its inhabitants. It is a place of coexistence of the two spheres: material and human, which together form a complex system with interrelationships, functioning on the principle of feedback, imposing on each other distinguishing marks. The paper tries to answer the question: what traces in the spatial structure of the cities in which they were created, have left bridges that are often outstanding works of technology and art. But the search for these traces concerns the physiognomic and social realm of the city. Therefore, questions concerning them are in the field of spatial identity space. The research focuses on the analysis of archival iconographic materials in the field of construction history and contemporary satellite images from the location of selected bridges. They are supplemented with stories of cultures and people connected with these places. They create a unique story about the traces of bridges in the city. These selected places are Avignon, Carcassonne, Paris, Prague, Mostar, Narni and small and old Polish city Kłodzko. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Opania S., Salamak M.",10.1088/1757-899X/471/9/092001
327,,2019,Conference Paper,Selected Problems of Implementation of Standards for Unified System of Tactile Indicators,"The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is intended to allow independent functioning and full access to all realms of life to all people with disabilities. The Convention imposes an obligation on the state to ensure that all persons with disabilities have access to physical environment, means of transport, information and communication, including ICT technologies and systems, as well as other tools and services, commonly accessible or assured, both in the cities and in the countryside, on equal basis. Having this in mind, together with the voice of the persons with blindness or having greatly reduced vision, and taking into account the chaos in the markings in public space that were supposed to improve the way the persons with disabilities move, it is necessary to design and implement the adequate standards on the roads and in the streets. It is estimated that about 5% of the total country population in Poland are persons with disabilities. About 1.8 million of them are people affected by blindness, partial blindness or low vision, who at the same time are active participants of the public space and of the road traffic. However, the lack of any systemic solutions regulated by law that improve safety in the road traffic is a serious problem in enabling access to culture, as well as free and safe movement for persons with poor vision. The article presents the design failures, executive errors and an impact of the usage of the unified warning system that is obligatory countrywide for the safety of persons with disabilities in public space. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Towns of Malopolska Voivodeship in number of 61 are characterized by a significant diversity in size and level of development. Small towns which make up over 77% of the total number differ considerably both in the aspect of the ongoing demographic processes and the results of the contemporary economic transformation. The vast majority of cities in Malopolska in number 43 towns are quite small with population below 20 thousand inhabitants. The smallest towns barely exceed 2 thousand people. There are approximately 30 thousand various business operating at present in all small towns of Malopolska Voivodeship. Their number varies from area to area depending on economic and social factors as well as on the geographic location transport accessibility. Social and spatial growth of small towns is affected by the globalization and metropolisation processes. The process of current transportation of the country economic system is reflected in spatial changes of the towns in the Malopolska. Prospect of development of small towns are differently due to changes of their economic functions and influenced by the geographic position, communal and technical infrastructure. Another parallel subject of consideration are revitalization activities undertaken within local revitalization programmes which are a basis for obtaining EU assistance funds allotted for this purpose. Author presents the planned spatial activities closed in revitalization programmes for the purpose of softening the conflicts in spatial sphere, improvement of living conditions and increasing of attractiveness for investors and tourists. Centres of small towns have symbolic significance for the sense of identity of their inhabitants. These are the areas where there are religions and historic buildings as well as public spaces promoting integration of residents such as market squares. In present social-economic conditions landmark squares in small towns due to preserved values despite of various degradations should be and can be remarkable and significant element of town attractiveness. Small towns have culture related assets and a special identity which may attract numerous tourists and investors on the condition that they have formulated a precise strategy of development high-lighting the elements most powerfully expressing their identity. The ways of development of small towns in their social-economic growth is related to diverse service functions and individual functional and aesthetic programme consistent with the towns specific character and its role in the region. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Pawlak A.,10.1088/1757-899X/471/11/112061
329,,2019,Conference Paper,Architecture of the National Bank of Czechoslovakia in the Territory of Present-day Slovakia (1918 - 1938),"The end of the Great war brought about many changes in the European political, social and economic climate. Monarchies were replaced with more democratic systems, countries lost their territories, and new sates based on national principle were established. In 1918, after a period of ethnic oppression and magyarization in the Hungarian part of the Habsburg Empire following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the Bohemian and Slovak people declared their independence and founded a new national state - the Czechoslovakia. The period short after its foundation was one full of enthusiasm and joy stemming from the newfound freedom and opportunity for cultivation of national culture, identity and politics in democratic environment on the one hand, and challenges brought by the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian economy and political system on the other. As a result of establishing the new state, the need arose to define its nation by architecture and the issue of National Style reemerged. After the brief period of Rondocubism preference, for some time, the official buildings retained certain expressive character and massive features. Even after giving way to Modernism, the sense of traditionalism was evident. In the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia, bank buildings, as buildings of institutions that once supported national-emancipatory aspirations of Slovak people, bank architecture often used well-established schemes and preferred more traditional designs to convey desired messages. The institution in charge of monetary separation and management of the new currency was the Banking Office of the Ministry of Finance and subsequently the National Bank of Czechoslovakia (since 1926). After the collapse of Austro-Hungarian Empire, all the buildings of branch offices of the former central bank - the Austro-Hungarian Bank - were took over by the Czechoslovak government. These were often extended, as were the cases of branch office buildings in Bratislava, Košice and Žilina. When they no longer fitted the formal or capacity criteria, three new branch office buildings were built on the territory of present-day Slovakia: a neo-renaissance building in Banská Bystrica (Ladislav Skřivánek, 1930 - 1932) and two buildings in the style of regional modernism with notes of traditionalism and classical features in Ružomberok (Vladimír Fischer, 1930 - 1932) and Bratislava (Emil Belluš, 1936-1938). The article examines stylistic, ideological, formal, and layout requirements for an architectural concept of a central bank institution demonstrated on the examples of branch office buildings built during existence of the First Czechoslovak Republic in the territory of the present-day Slovakia. As a part of a systematic research focused on Slovak bank buildings, the chosen buildings will be analysed, compared with relevant examples, and interpreted in the context of political, social, and economical situation, and style and typological particularities. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Ondrusova K.,10.1088/1757-899X/471/8/082043
331,,2019,Book Chapter,Floating Village Cua Van: Promoting Climate-Adaptive Ecotourism with Principles of Living Spaces,"Ha Long Bay—the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site on Vietnam’s northeastern seacoast—is often considered one of the world’s most beautiful bays. This bay is also famous for many floating fishing villages where the people live together on the sea as a community. However, due to rapid population growth in the floating villages, the present situation shows lacks in urban planning, waste management and development of infrastructure. Ha Long Bay had suffered the pressure of environmental pollution and resource degradation. Since 2014, in order to protect the UNESCO World Heritage Site, the local authority has planned a project to demolish the floating villages and move these communities to the mainland. In fact, the demolition project has caused the loss of cultural heritage and a tourist attraction in Ha Long Bay. The goal of this study is to propose a sustainable concept of living space organization for Cua Van, the largest floating village in Ha Long Bay, in order to preserve, revive, and promote floating communities as a unique heritage culture and tourist attraction. Therefore, a detailed analysis of environment and socio-cultural, economic, architectural characteristics of Cua Van is provided in this study. The analysis does not only accumulate precious traditional values that need to be preserved and developed in the proposed concept but also illustrate its weakness that need to be addressed to optimally design the future sustainable floating village. Based on these studies, as well as on general principles of a sustainable floating community and promoting ecotourism, the study proposes a living space concept for Cua Van, including solutions to both a sustainable floating community adapting to climate change and ecotourism development. The proposed concept would ensure stable and permanent living on the water for water dwellers and reduce human-induced impacts on the environment as well as an increasing livelihood income by tourism development. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Climate change; Ecotourism; Floating villages; Sustainable floating community,"Trang N.T.T., Vukorep I., Stopp H.",10.1007/978-3-030-10804-5_2

It argues that the protection of culture is a pivotal element in the creation of a healthy city. Balinese culture involves long-standing traditions in a myriad of art forms, including religion, architecture, urban planning, language, dance, art, theatre, painting, sculpture, silversmithing, and wood carving. Culture in Balinese society refers predominantly to the traditional system of government and beliefs called adat and sima. While Balinese live within a system of globalized capitalism, ideologically they remain rooted in the customs and traditions of village life. In consequence, Balinese culture is increasingly becoming a ‘manufactured’ phenomenon as the processes of commodification deepen. The state’s feeble planning action to protect culture disguises its tacit support for private capital against the will of the people for truthful and significant policies that work in the best interests of cultural conservation. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,Suartika G.A.M.,10.4324/9781351211543-18

It highlights the potential potency of urban planning and design in children’s and young people’s environmental and developmental experience. The chapter considers the importance of attending to the prevalence and quality of children’s environments - both indoor and outdoor - as these designed environments provide the context for most children’s lives in urban contexts. The recognition of children’s and young people’s ability to contribute to urban planning and design remains the province of committed individuals and one-off projects rather than being continuously embedded in professional practice.

And the research on urban sprawl or urban growth has mostly focused on the urbanization of buildings, such as bungalows changing into skyscrapers. Moreover, there are a lot of scholars study urban sprawl from the aspect of evolution and development of industry in the urban fringe. But more and more sociologists present an idea that urbanism is not only the evolution of land use or changes of other objective things, is but also a kind of life style, a whole set of social and culture characteristics, which is totally different from that of rural area. This review summarizes studies of urban sprawl from many sides, and then conducts a diverse understanding of urban sprawl and urbanization, which points out that social is made of people and urbanization should add the concept of people's urbanism, such as the social mixing, social integration. Only when the social urbanism is completed, the urbanization is done and urban sprawl finishes. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Ge X., Wu B.",10.1061/9780784482308.101
337,,2018,Conference Paper,The Public Policy Strategies Fostering Smart Cities,"According to the Getùlio Vargas Foundation - FGV (2015), Smart Cities are people interacting and using energy systems, materials, services and financing to catalyze economic development and improved quality of life. These interaction flows are considered smart for making strategic use of infrastructure, services, information and communication with urban planning and management to meet social and economic needs of society. According to Berrone (2016), the 10 dimensions indicate the level of intelligence of a city: governance, public administration, urban planning, technology, the environment, international connections, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. Thus, this study is proposed here address two of these topics: governance and economy. To Araúhajo (2002), the term governance as the ability of a government has to design and implement their policies this ability refers to the financial sphere, managerial and technical, while governance implies the conditions the exercise of political is based on the analysis of these dimensions that see the role of social cohesion so necessary for the construction of a structure and culture of smart cities. Once appropriating this culture, economic development will be the reflection of that interaction. According to Nakagama, cases successful in smart cities as Australia, show that generating real business results of short-term, especially as the government encouragement (tax incentives and access to credit), provides a creative economy, able to retain talents in local companies with good revenue. Thus, this paper aims to make a thematic focus on what public policy strategies that drive the construction of smart cities in order to verify the impact of public policies and this study the importance of public engagement in governance: identify talent retention strategies and analyze the socio-economic development. Thus, a descriptive and exploratory methodology grounded in case study of governance practices in Australia will be applied, these practices opposed to the Brazilian. © 2017 IEEE.",Economic Development; public Policies; Smart Cities,"Lima I., Marques C., Moraes R., Sarmento V., Carvalho Z.",10.1109/S3C.2017.8501409

The 2006 Jagalchi Market Modernization project is an example of facility modernization that entailed the redevelopment of an existing building in one of the most historic seafood markets in Busan Metropolitan City. Established during the Korean War (1950–1953) while Busan was the city with the most war refugees, the market is a significant historic place that is imbued with a unique culture created by the people who have sustained the market over the past 60 years.

It also problematizes the outward-looking nature of the Jagalchi Market Modernization, which is represented by the architectural design of the new Jagalchi Market building and the street renovation project targeting outside visitors, and it discusses the unique sense of place that was either neglected or compromised during the process of market modernization. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Collective place experience; Sense of place; Traditional market modernization; Urban design,Lee S.,10.1007/978-3-319-72311-2_6
340,,2018,Book Chapter,"To plan, design and evaluate “urban mending”","Pope Francis’s encyclical provides researchers concerned with the problem of the urban periphery with three suggestions. The first is to renounce any specialized approach that is based on an acritical confidence in the power of science and technology to solve the complex problems of today’s world, particularly those that concern the environment and the poor. The second is to adopt an approach based on a “culture of care” for nature and for the most vulnerable people, and third approach is to include people (especially those who are weakest) in transparent decision-making processes that affect the quality of their lives. Starting from these suggestions, and from Renzo Piano’s statement that, at present and in the future, “the mission of architecture is to save the outskirts” through “a huge work of mending”, we believe that researchers should, with humility, make use of the ‘urban-mending’ approach when dealing with the complexity of regeneration projects. At the levels of both the architectural project and urban planning, they should adopt an integrated, interdisciplinary approach that is lighter and more sensitive than those used in the past. This will help them to face up to the multidimensionality and complexity of redeveloping peripheral areas. All stakeholders, especially the weakest people in society, should be empowered and involved in public decision making and planning implementation. Finally, genuine participation of the marginalized, excluded and disaffected inhabitants of peripheral areas (i.e., the outcasts) can be achieved using a “deliberative-democratic” approach. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Evaluation; Inclusion empowerment; Urban distressed areas; Urban mending; Urban regeneration project,"Berni M., Renzi R., Rossi R.",10.1007/978-3-319-78271-3_12

343,,2017,Conference Paper,City and Urbanity in the Social Discourse,"The aim of our article is an attempt to present the concept of urbanity that has been shaped throughout centuries along with the development of European civilisation and now entered a new phase of social production of space based on cultural dimensions. The future of the majority of World's population is connected currently with the urban life with the assumption that qualitative characteristics of life in the 21st century define the quality of civilisation itself. Contrary to many scientists' predictions of the decline of the city and urbanity, new reviving urban projects, social local activities and everyday urbanism appear which are connected with redefinition of the city as a community. The rebirth of cities, currently referred to as ""urban renaissance"", ""urban resurgence"" or ""urban revival"", can be also defined in terms of new urbanity regarded as an insightful and creative attitude towards the city and its culture. The elementary order of things was determined in the last decades not by the space but by the time and its acceleration and simultaneously the role of architecture alters. The course of thinking about the city is changing from a single space-time city towards a personalised city, based on individual identities and corresponding places in the physical and virtual space. That can mean a new role of the city in the creation of urbanity. In the era of advanced communication technologies, a question arises about the ontological status of the city when the emphasis is placed on independence and individuality in interactions between people. Social life becomes detached from traditional spatial patterns and practices. We are interested in the urbanity understood in the wider context of cultural urban studies which are focused on new ways of organising the communication space and social relations. We will refer in this article to the values constitutive for the city and urbanity that guided the idea of the city since the dawn of time as well as its new deconstructed forms (e.g. the pop-up city, neo-bohemia, the creative class, neighbour communities, urban guerrilla gardening, experimental urban farms, etc.). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Dymnicka M., Badach J.",10.1088/1757-899X/245/4/042058
346,,2017,Conference Paper,A way to reconnect I Cycling Without,"Thinking about the development of cities, demographic changes and changing lifestyles are the challenges of today. In order to create livable places for everybody, we need to think urban planning in a new way. By making sure, that all parts of a community have access to their surroundings and can participate in shaping the landscape they live in, we create an inclusive, welcoming neighborhood with a unique identity. To highlight the peculiarity of a place we have to focus on tradition and culture taking into account the people using the urban landscape. Currently, some groups have a hard time to understand and contribute the ways of nowadays planning processes. In some places, elderly people can't be an active part of their environment, out of the loss of mobility. Being outside of a neighborhoods' community reduces their quality of life as well as the diversity of the urban landscape. Through the initiative 'Cycling Without Age' they get a chance to engage to the local society - the neighborhood can reconnect to its stories, its memories and the natural variety, which is necessary to create an exceptional place. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.",Cycling; Intergenerational; Quality of life; Urban landscape,"Tüchsen J., Melenhorst M.",
347,,2017,Conference Paper,Design and implementation of human mobility embedded system for urban planning of smart city,"The mobility model will help us to simulate the movements of people more realistic as in real case. This paper developed human mobility system using random way point and random walk methods to model the individual movement of person in different places within area of Baghdad, Iraq. There are a lot of types of mobility model but we use Random Way Point (RWP) because it is simple, most common use and needs less memory and time for computation. The geographical information and maps of the cities are used to tell the person about the constraints and correct the direction of motion in different areas to generate more accurate data. Tested areas are quite different in style, structure, social, history and culture. The most similar thing between them is that they are both in continuously changing which is the one of biggest difficulties in designing the city. Al-Sadar city is one of biggest population city in Baghdad, Iraq. It has three millions people population. We choose 5000 users moves from Al-Sadar city to two different places in Baghdad: Al- Khadmia and Al-Zawra. Al-Khadmiia is old and religion place and Al-Zawra is biggest public garden in Baghdad. In our work, we find the best ways that connect Al-Sadar city with both places. We decide the best ways depending on distances and traffic between them. It gives good method to build smart transportation and smart city using mobility and traffic models. .This paper will help urban decision maker to suggest the analytical model for urban space and have a clear picture about the city: how can it change, how do the people move in the city, what are the problems and how can solve them to generate smart city. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Themes related to human comfort are properly considered as well, both at physical and social level, namely relational comfort between people living in the same built environment. Again, relationship is the key word. In this context, university student residences have been often studied as large buildings hosting several and complex functions, where people with different habits, education, origins and culture live together. Besides, dorms have particular relationships with the city, often acting as places for urban regeneration. The study presented here concerns the analysis of the recent San Bartolomeo student dorm, performed with focus groups with the occupants and questionnaires, on-site monitoring survey and energy modelling in transient state. The purpose is to present a comprehensive study on the constructive and energetic aspects of existing building complexes, in order to define a possible procedure aimed at considering the overall comfort level of the living community and the interaction with the urban surrounding from an operational and social point of view. © International Society of the Built Environment.",Human comfort; Smart community; Social and relational comfort; University residence; Urban design strategies,"Albatici R., Gabbi F., Gadotti A.",10.1177/1420326X16656473
350,,2016,Book Chapter,Promptness and sustainability in town reconstruction following the 2011 great east Japan earthquake,"Local governments in Iwate Prefecture also drew respective plans for reconstruction to rebuild their cities, financially backed up by the prefectural and national governments coupled with special laws and measures. They are planning central city areas under the principles of DRR as well as BBB. There are too many laws pertaining to disaster prevention and reconstruction to refer to in full here. Therefore, this chapter focuses only on some of the new enactments after the GEJE. But attention has to be paid to their approaches to reconstruction when it comes to the question of whether they sufficiently concord with DRR and BBB (Ikuta 2013; Kaneko 2014). The Basic Act on Reconstruction in Response to the GEJE 2011 (hereinafter the Basic Act 2011) prescribes that, considering the unprecedented national crisis caused by the GEJE, the act has the purpose of promoting the smooth and prompt reconstruction and revitalization of a vibrant Japan, securing financial resources, identifying afflicted areas as Special Zones for Reconstruction with institutional and tax measures and establishing a Reconstruction Agency to undertake tasks regarding integrated national measures (Art. 1). The Basic Act 2011 then prescribes its basic philosophy, adopting the idea of the building back better concept, promoting dramatic measures for revitalization that are not limited to physical recovery of afflicted facilities, but also reconstruction measures to assist individuals to overcome the disaster and lead prosperous lives while honoring local culture and enhancing people’s ties with the community (Art. 2). The Act for Special Zones for Reconstruction 2011 was enacted as separate legislation from the Basic Act 2011 to implement the reconstruction measures. Under this legislation, afflicted local governments designated as special areas can acquire significantly larger budget funds from the national government for recovery and can deregulate their spatial planning under the Agricultural Land Act, the Forest Act and the Urban Planning Act. Via this funding and deregulation, they can plan recovery-related projects for disaster prevention: the promotion of collective relocation, functional reinforcement of fishery villages, land reallocation for the revival of affected city areas, basic construction to lead city centers towards recovery from the tsunami and disaster-resistant public housing. The Act on Town Planning for Tsunami Disaster Prevention 2011 allows prefectural governments to set tsunami hazard zones and municipal governments to make integrated town plans for tsunami disaster prevention. Under the act, prefectural governments can set the presumed tsunami hazard zones and special tsunami warning zones. In the latter zone, normal town planning and building activities are restricted. © 2016 Yuka KANEKO, Katsumi MATSUOKA and Toshihisa TOYODA.",,Matsuoka K.,10.4324/9781315680323-25
351,,2016,Article,"Formulation of design criteria based on recognition and comparison of user patterns of behavior, emphasizing on the role of climate in urban public spaces, case studies: Shahr-E-Kord and Bushehr","Introduction: Climate has always been one the main factors of designing urban spaces in Iran since past centuries. By analyzing urban spaces it can be concluded that different cities have different urban spaces due to climate differences. One of the main reasons of the differences in the type and orientation of urban spaces is the climate as one of the key factors in designing these areas. Regarding climate in designing is equivalent to involving the users of the space, basically because climate adjustments can encourage more people to use the designed spaces. Hence, it can be said that climatic spaces are humanistic spaces as well. Therefore, climate directly influence culture and plays a decisive role both in the body and behavior of the users. Thus, it could have a very effective role in how people use or how they behave in designed spaces. Materials and methods: A mix of several methods has been used for more compatibility with research purposes. This used library documents and has a comparative-analytical method. The basic data and the research background information have been gathered through documentative method and from library resources. For the fieldwork, the descriptive method (describing the phenomenon) has been used. Then, people patterns of behaviors were studied by an interpretative-qualitative method in each climate to analyze and infer the discussions in order. And at last, a comparative method has been used to analyze the results in order to set out urban design criteria. In this comparative method, it was tried to compare people patterns of behavior in two cold-mountainous, and hot and humid climates, and to analyze its results to elicit criteria for urban space design considering the effects of climate on the user behaviors. In this research, the people behaviors were studied, analyzed and compared in two different seasons of the year (the hottest and the coldest seasons) by the use of serial photography. Thus, people different patterns of behaviors in different climates and the ways they use the spaces were investigated, by the observation a set of design criteria could be developed to be applied in the design/redesign of urban spaces to improve their qualities. (Figure Presented) The theory In general, people uses of urban spaces may have two stages: 1. Presence in urban space. 2. Tendency to continue to stay in the urban space. There are two kinds of qualities in urban environment. First, the qualities which are the main requirements of people presence in public spaces, i.e. primary qualities. Second, the qualities encouraging people to stay in the space for a longer time. Meanwhile, there are some qualities like climatic comfort which play effective role in both primary and secondary qualities. This very important factor is in full adaptation with human physical characteristics and is the main requirement of people presence in the space. It also plays an undeniable role in the way people use the space and behave there. Climatic comfort can increase the number of opportunities to use the space. If the space is designed with consideration of all aspects, including the user behaviors, it can be used by all people in various periods of time during the day, and in different seasons. Results and discussion: Design guidelines in hot and humid climate are formulated. They emphasize on the role of climate to determine people patterns of behavior. Here, regarding the achievements of local observations and the recognition, the design criteria are proposed at two different scales, the city scale and the site scale. A) The city scale: Location of the space in the shade: This is the most important factor affecting the use of space in hot and humid climates. If the open space includes shaded parts, people preference to stay there will increase. Therefore, location in the shade can be considered as an important requirement for people use of space in this climate. Other factor is natural ventilation and the space orientation parallel to the wind flows: This is the second factor affecting the use of public spaces in hot and humid climate. Natural ventilation of open spaces happens by the airflows coming from the sea. It helps the locals reduce the high unpleasant humidity in this climate, so it encourages passersby to stop and stay in the space. B) The site scale: • To avoid designing vast urban open spaces in hot and humid climate. • Making orientation of the open spaces toward the sea to moderate the hot weather and reduce the humidity by the sea airflows. Local observations also verify that successful spaces in this climate have perpendicular orientation to the sea to benefit from its cool airflows for natural ventilation. Formulating design guidelines in cold and mountainous climate emphasizes the role of climate to determine people pattern of behavior: Local observations in Shahr-E-Kord show that the two fallowing factors have determined the role of people use of space in cold and mountainous climate. 1-Maximizing the direct sunshine: It is a positive point for the open spaces in the cold winter weather of mountainous climate, because it helps the space to be more welcoming and favorable for people. 2-Not to be windward: This factor also has direct effect on how people attend and behave in the space. The researcher's observations and notes in cold and mountainous climate show that the spaces which are exposed to direct wind flows are not favorable for people. A) The city scale: • For designing open spaces and its proposed land uses, it is better to locate attractive uses at the southern and east-southern side of the space, because it helps to provide favorable sunlight for the space during cold winter days and facilitates the use of space for people. • In the cold and mountainous climate, it is better to design urban spaces in form of small squares because it reduces the entrance of wind flows and provides people with climatic comfort. It must be mentioned that vast squares in this climate can benefit from the increased direct sunlight and heat. But the effect of the increased airflows in these spaces is highly unfavorable and disturbs the climatic comfort. Thus, they are not recommended. B) The site scale: • It is better to design crowded spaces as semi-open spaces, because enclosed and covered spaces are more favorable in all seasons for their shelters from the sun, wind, rain and snow. • In cold climates, it is important to use types of plants which prevent spaces from undesired wind, while not casting shades during cold seasons, since trees can provide favorable shades for summer time. Conclusion: The results and findings of this research are presented in a set of operational and applicable recommendations, some of which might seem unimportant. But they are undeniably essential. Simple solutions for ordinary problems of existing urban spaces can lead to significant improvements in the space vitality and people social life. William White expresses the extract of his long term studies in one sentence: ""people seat where the seating exists."" This sentence might seem clear and typical, but it is very important and can notably change the life of a city. Thus, the simplicity of changes does not mean that they are inconsiderable. It might be possible to change the destination of a space simply by adding shelters and awnings or providing sunny spaces in cold and mountainous climates and shaded spaces in hot and humid ones.",Behavior patterns; Bushehr; Climate; Climatic comfort; Shahr-E-Kord,"Bahrainy S.H., Aghakarimi A.",
353,,2016,Editorial,Preface to Part 5,"The chapters in this Part of the book are concerned what are amongst the most critical challenges facing contemporary cities and urban planning – how to support, understand and manage the cultural practices of urban populations. At stake is the creation of environments where different social groups can live, work, mingle, and express their cultures and values. Also important is the equitable distribution of urban resources. When contemplating such issues, attention frequently turns to public space because this is where the texture, complexity and diversity of urban life is most readily revealed. And so it is with the chapters here, which in differing ways acknowledge that the quality, use and presence of urban public space are central to the way in which people experience and relate to the city as resident or visitor, and whether encountering it in the context of work, education or leisure (to name but three). Public space is also linked to the development and maintenance of civic culture. Parks, footpaths, beaches, the verges of rivers and waterways are all important in this respect, as are roads and thoroughfares – the sites of intersection, movement and transportation. © 2013 Greg Young and Deborah Stevenson.

He uses transportable models and moving workshops as a way to involve citizens in the urban planning process. He takes a medley of recycled materials of vibrant colors and varied shapes, textures, and sizes to urban neighborhoods, street corners and public locations. By setting up these interactive models in publicly accessible locations, he encourages curious participants to use their hands and minds to experiment and create models of their ideal city, street, public space, or building. These mobile and on site events take the planning process directly to the people. By giving them the opportunity to have a 'hands-on' experience in envisioning their city, workshops help participants feel more connected to the urban landscape that surrounds them. These experiences set the groundwork for them to get involved in urban planning, and can help provide policy makers, urban planners, and architects with tools for information gathering. © Arijit Sen and Jennifer Johung 2013.

356,,2016,Book,"Rights to public space: Law, culture, and gentrification in the American west","This book examines the roles that public space plays in gentrification. Considering both cultural norms of public behavior and the municipal regulation of behavior in public, it shows how commonplace acts in everyday public spaces like sidewalks, streets, and parks work to establish neighborhood legitimacy for newcomers while delegitimizing once authentic public practices of long-timers. With evidence drawn from the formerly Latino neighborhood of Highland in Denver, Colorado, this ethnographic study demonstrates how the regulation of public space plays a pivotal role in neighborhood change. First, there is often a profound disharmony between how people from different cultural complexes interpret and sanction behavior in everyday public spaces. Second, because regulations, codes, urban design, and enforcement protocols are deliberately changed, commonplace activities longtime neighborhood residents feel they have a right to do along sidewalks and streets and within their neighborhood parks sometimes unexpectedly misalign with what is actually possible or legal to do in these publicly accessible spaces. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",Gentrification; Governance; Neighborhood change; Public space; Urban planning; Urban sociology; Urban studies; US west,Langegger S.,10.1007/978-3-319-41177-4
357,,2016,Article,"Ibero-America, Future City. Sustainable Cities and Environment [Iberoamérica, Ciudad Futura ciudades sostenibles y medioambiente]","""Cities are complex architecture works. Cities are the physical manifestation of the largest union of forces. Economic forces, social forces, environmental forces"". (Urbanized, 2011) Cities are explored as a critical component to transform human life, but when we talk about cities of the future, we mean that existing cities are not as blank pages but they are existing cites and our ability to transform them. We stand by this century will be the century of cities and the future of humanity will put into practice in them. Success of cities will lie in sustainability and environment. We must rethink the design of cities and approach to them from multiple perspectives and scales to recover their human side. This paper proposes a critic exploration of some of the tools we can use to plan the city of the future to get alliances between current cities and future cities. The conjoined actions of these alliances configures a strategy that makes possible these future cities to remain essentially successful throughout time. Thematically, the article begins with a dissertation about the Forum of Latin-American cities where aforementioned tools and other ideas to imagine the ways to change Ibero- American cities into innovative cities were debated. Next, the text examines the concept of sustainable cities and environment through various experiences in Mexico City to deduce, secondly, new ways of acting in the urban-design of cities. In order to sustain such argument, the paper proposes a review of cases to establish the viability of areas of collective use within both the geographic landscape and time. As a result, every concept is researched and put on an example of Mexico City. The first example of the research studies an architectural ensemble, formed by a garden and two residential buildings called Isabel and Ermita buildings and they were designed by Juan Segura Gutierrez in the first thirties of the last century. Residents used to share the common spaces in a natural environment and there, they created social structures that brought together. At the present time, that garden doesn't exit and the two buildings are tumbledown but the neighbors remind the daily nature character there used to be there, and they demand to get back into that routine because it is part of their collective imagination. Secondly, we will analyze a neighborhood called President Miguel Aleman designed with Modern Movement criteria by Mario Pani Darqui in 1949. This social condominium has public resources as swimming pool, tennis court, post office, laundromat and other installations. The film Elevator describes the evolution of the common spaces-inside and outside the residential buildings-and the current everyday life by elevator operator's testimony. The last Mexican example consists in a territorial landscape project called Mexico: Future City by a collective of citizens, architects, engineers, geographers, biologists, sociologists and specializes in other disciplines that propose the complex interactions of multiple scales between territorial and anthropomorphic to recover the originally lake system of the metropolis, across four strategies: water, territory, energy and public spaces. This global project tries to generate a new system of lakes fed by the waste water that take place in the capital and seeks to give solution to the problem. Methodologically, the research consisted on elaborating a database of good practices and selected sources from historical newspaper and periodicals library, social network, films and work in situ such as air-flies, interviews and inquiries related to the three Mexican examples and consequently synthesizes them in three deduced urban concepts. As a result, the research could obtain a timeline-poster to put on Latin American City. The present experience is a way of communicating urban history, an applied example of the use of the timeline through the history of Latin American City, on an urban example: Mexico City. The suitability of this method of research is justified in the concurrency of urban, architectural and social details and in chronological order. The timeline offers an alternative to the academic model and to the inherited learning process, which identifies and exposes the transversal possible strategies to transform Ibero-American City. The present article approaches three scales of the city, the first one is the scale of buildings, the second one relating to urban architectural ensembles and the last one in response to the territorial projects scale. The three scales must always improve and renew the public space and get the compactness of the city that has to offer to the users of urban projects that resolve their needs. We should not fear to turn urban highways into avenues or to re-formulate the shared spaces. Beside possessing the people, we will strain for realizing economically profitable practices, a solution to this problem is recycling -this suggests to transform our urban heritage, instead of demolish and build again. We will investigate the geography trying to revert the hurts caused to the environment. Our cities must take advantage of the resources and resign the culture of commanding discarded cards of an irrational way. Architecture and consistently City are inspired by nature that governs the and at the same time, nature offers architecture and city, the necessary instruments to give then harmony and form. The urban experimental spaces-as closed to the traffic streets during the weekends or the creation of new temporary topographies that are part of culture urban festivals- are contemporary urban actions that attract and assemble citizens. These kind of urban projects can transform cities as playful to support the festive environment during the accomplishment of an event and they can turn into a completely new way of working as urban designers by this methodology of large-scale work. The Architecture of Future City point to urban models that take advantage of the nature resources, offer solutions that respect environment and propitiate spaces of conviviality and social harmony. The main goal of this article is to discover the contemporary rules to put on practice in Latin- American Cities as Mexico City; therefore, the dissertation explores the urban evolution since the thirties to this moment through the study of three urban concepts: an idea of historical present, an idea of recovered city and the reversionary urban conversions. Metropolis will change this century into megalopolis ally with environment if they want to survive. Nature and citizens will be two of the highest players to encourage this sustainable revolution. © 2016 CIRIEC-España.",Historical present; Participatory urban design; Recycling; Reversibility; Sustainability; Water basins,Llorens M.S.,

361,,2016,Conference Paper,Industry and Community in Anina,"After the industrial ""Big-Bang"", we can see only the devastating effects of a postindustrial ""Big-Crunch"". The problems of the post-industrial cities are (with some differences like the geographical region, local culture, and the typology of the industry), universal and fundamental. We shall try to analyze what were the variable and invariable factors in the industrial society and how did the dual industry-community system worked, taking the mining city of Anina, from Romania as a case study. The more complex a system is, the more vulnerable it gets. Anina formed as a result of man's desire to effectively exploit nature. Extraction of the precious coal from underground created in successive stages certain needs and also imposed a model for generating the mono-industrial city. The locations of the mineral deposits, the regional infrastructure and the topography of the terrain were the physical invariants which all future urban developments were based on. However, the development of technology, the needs of the global market, the available workforce and the new syndicates were strong influences in the way mining assemblies were built. Industry represented the generative force of the city, and was also the skeleton on which the community was founded on. People represented the living component of the mineral universe of what later became a city of continuous technological evolution. Anina, a small city at the middle of the 19th century (about 2 000 inhabitants) was under the effects of a demographical explosion over a few decades. After people found out about the valuable coal deposits, they started coming to the city. By 1912 there were 15000 inhabitants. Such a big surplus of people gave birth to the worker's colonies. They represented an adequate model for managing the complex problems that appeared as a result of the constant demographical increase. What are the characteristics of the building assemblies, the advantages and disadvantages that came with them, how did they adapt to the evolving community and what were the effects on the long term in Anina are just a few of the questions raised in this study.",Anina; community; industrial landscape; post-industrial age,"Rǎzvan D.D., Andreescu I., Paşcu G.",10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.789
362,,2016,Conference Paper,Designing for small bathrooms,"This paper will focus on how to design a series of bathroom products that work well for small bathrooms using the principles of universal design. In home culture research, Quitzau and Røpke has studied bathroom transformation from hygiene to well-being. Bathrooms are one of the rooms in apartments that do not have good solutions for small spaces. This is unfortunate since it is the bathroom that has the least amount of space in urban apartments. This leads many people to have too little bathroom space due to furniture, toilets, showers, etc. In today's society, the bathroom is no longer just a purpose room. It is used for relaxation and wellness. This has led to a trend where large furniture, such as freestanding bathtubs, dominate today's market. This in turn allows the few solutions that exist for small bathrooms to remain poorly conceived. The research question was therefore how to create solutions for small bathrooms to get the same sense of well-being as in larger bathrooms through universal design principals. The principles of universal design, observations and in-depth interviews were used in the study. This study can help to create a greater understanding of how to design small bathrooms. It will be relevant in a cross disciplinary field, including for professionals in plumbing, product design and technical solutions. This will also increase the well-being of users of the bathroom.",Bathroom design; Interview; Observation; Urban design,"Sivertsen A.K., Berg A.",
363,,2016,Conference Paper,Continuity by change - 3 ways of conversion in modern architecture. The case of Gdynia,"Continuity is today seen as one of the important values of architecture and urban planning. Keeping and preserving the legacy of the past is a strong tendency today and it includes also the legacy of Modernism. Yet, as time goes on, changes appear inevitable. The case is, how to make them a good continuation in terms of architecture and culture. Conversion in the heritage of Modern Movement often concerns both the structure of the buildings and their function. It mainly focuses on extension, renovation or rebuilding the old structure. Those actions usually achieve their functional and economic goals, but the architectural results are often more debatable. The article presents three examples of ""continuity by change"" in modern architecture of Gdynia: the extension of the City Market Halls carried out in the 1991; the renovation of the Marine Station conducted in 2013-14; and the partial demolition and rebuilding of the Oil Plant executed in 2011-2014. All those buildings are valuable examples of Modern Movement heritage, and two are listed. During the conversion they changed both, their function and architectural form, but the visual effects in every case differed from good to not satisfactory. That was because the final results of such actions depended not only on the talent and knowledge of the architect, but also on the level of sensitivity and collaboration between the other 4 actors which took part in those changes: the owners; the local authorities; the conservationists; and the local society. In conclusion, ""continuity by change"" in Modern Movement heritage may give a wonderful opportunity for architecture and for cultural heritage. However, it demands much effort from all people in charge, including the developer and the local society. Yet, it is the only proper way to avoid the still frequent fate of many valuable buildings of modern legacy-negligence and disruption. © Pola Virgioli, 2016.",,Sołtysik M.,

The nature and rate of urbanisation and urban growth have elicited multiple interpretations, notwithstanding an emerging consensus about the importance of the city in India’s future. With cities, especially larger ones, being seen to propel economic growth in post-liberalisation India, they have come to be the focus of extensive, and arguably unprecedented, development policies. If urban development policies have seen a sea of change in post-liberalisation period, these have been matched with the introduction of new forms of urban governance. Indian cities are often represented as a melting pot of people, spaces and cultures.

370,,2014,Book Chapter,Shifting gears: The intersections of race and sustainability in Memphis,"Memphis is a city of dichotomies and disparities, a perplexing city of illustrative idiosyncrasies and instructive ironies. The city roils with a sweaty, gritty, creative energy, yet it has struggled to find a creative solution to overcoming its challenging past. As a global center of commerce and trade, the prosperity of the United States relies heavily on Memphis, yet Memphis is home to some of the nation’s most impoverished communities. The city is stretched geographically, fiscally, and socially in so many directions that gaining a sense of unity around any shared cultural ideal is a daunting exercise, one that Memphis has only recently begun to undertake. This chapter explores the emergence of “sustainability” in policy making and cultural perceptions in Memphis through conversations and controversies surrounding a proposal to institute a multi-use trail network across a geophysical landscape marked by socioeconomic and racial segregation. As Wanda Rushing (2009) puts it, “for more than one hundred years, changing views of space and place, conflicting values of ‘progress’ and preservation, as well as divisions of race, class, and gender have affected the physical and symbolic production of urban landscapes in Memphis” (Rushing 2009). How does the concept of “sustainability” as a social ideal play into the policies and decision making that are going to shape the future of a global city mired in a history of especially poor race relations, white flight, and cultural isolationism? A conversation on “sustainability” cannot occur without first dismantling a racialized “culture of fear” that impacts nearly every aspect of urban life in Memphis (Glassner 2000). To accomplish this, we dissect the discourses and practices associated with “community” and “safety” as they relate to transportation policy, urban planning, and alternative transportations infrastructure projects. We demonstrate how “safety” and “community” take on different meanings, even in adjoining neighborhoods, and provide ethnographic snapshots of people and communities affecting (or affected by) various connectivity and livability projects. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,"Farr M.A., Brondo K.V., Anglin S.",10.1017/CBO9781139923316.020

Case study of Poznan, Poland","The paper deals with the questions of a public space creation through the implementation of art and design. The idea of promotion the cultural features within a public space helps to increase the city space attractiveness. The author presents the case study of a downtown area of a city of Poznan in Poland, Wielkopolska region. As a result of an observation that there is a lack of a public space of culture and art in Poznan city centre, there is presented a proposal of an innovative and attractive functions implementation. There is also presented the research method of public space activization through art and design. The art is understood not only as temporary events but as the pieces of a small architecture and built areas of a cultural function as well. There was created an idea of a MAD city for people - which means searching for meaning, action and design in a city centre space. This idea is to be used as a tool to identify the existing and potential space for art in a city centre and to define whether it is a space of sacrum or of profanum. The tool helps to define what is the best use and purpose of a space in a context of an art implementation. It is also to create a functional system of socially and spatially attractive public spaces within a city centre. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

374,,2014,Conference Paper,Impacts of rail technology in 21st Century U.S. Cities,"This presentation analyzes the impact of transit technologies on the urban environment and evaluates land use, station design, and transit costs as a means of projecting the best options for intermodal stations and transit-oriented developments. Several commuter rail, AMTRAK, and freight rail corridors may be used in the future to accommodate heavy, light and/or high-speed rail systems in the United States. Diesel/electric locomotives, which populate urban rail corridors, have heavy load requirements and are industrial and/or utilitarian in appearance. However, diesel multiple units (DMUs) with lighter weight, increased fuel efficiency, ease of accessibility, additional capacity, enhanced performance and lower costs are competing for their market share. Currently, monorails, people movers, and streetcars - along with the traditional light and heavy rail systems - have public acceptance to enrich the urban environments surrounding the existing corridors, and enhance commuter experience. Many cities, however, are at a crossroads regarding transitioning from an automobile culture to a rail culture. Therefore, local cities willingly embrace opportunities for better environments. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Verma A.,10.1061/9780784413364.045

386,,2012,Article,Village and urban conservation areas. From image to contents [Bescherming van stads- en dorpsgezichten. Van beeld naar inhoud],"The instrument 'village and urban conservation area' has a history dating back to approximately 1900. In the first half of the twentieth century, for instance, protective regulations in the field of urban planning were already in effect on a municipal level and in the circles of the (Royal) Netherlands Archaeological Association (NOB) an initiative had already been taken for a Bill in which a vague provision in this field was included. It was not until 1961 that the village and urban conservation area was laid down in the first Monuments and Historic Buildings Act. The authority of designation as a village or urban conservation area then became the responsibility of the Government, but it had to be put into effect by the municipality concerned in so-called (protective) zoning plans. In practice, the demarcation of the area to be protected was often problematic and caused dilemmas about whether or not to include a certain area. In 1988 a new, still effective Monuments and Historic Buildings Act followed. The village and urban conservation area, so far considered 'visual' by many people, was also given structural and functional cultural-historical dimensions by this Act. The explanatory remarks on the designations have acquired a more profound character from around 1980 onwards and since that date they have also been accompanied by maps which could provide the initial impetus to 'conservation through development' instead of 'conservation through maintaining the image'. Under both Acts a total of approximately 430 village and urban conservation areas have now been designated and some dozens more are yet to follow. However, the instrument, now 50 years' old, is under discussion at the moment, because there is a preference for planning protection by the principal Dutch ministries involved, i.e. Education, Culture and Science (OCW), Economics, Agriculture and Innovation (ELI) and Infrastructure and Environment (IM). This may imply that the current designation programme will end and that the status of previously designated village and urban conservation areas will get undermined by backdoor methods. This might have the consequence that an established and accepted instrument is going to perish along with a concept that has not even taken shape adequately. Especially when further content is given to such a new concept - but under the flag of the village and urban conservation area - a meaningful symbiosis might take place.",,Niemeijer F.,
388,,2012,Conference Paper,Intercultural landscapes: An Australian approach to cultural literacy,"Introduction Australia has an indigenous culture with thousands of years of associative relationship to ""country"" and our contemporary urban centres are home to increasingly diverse populations of peoples from all corners of the globe. For landscape architects and urban designers this presents both the challenge of multiple 'sense of place'' and the opportunity to create a unique notion of 'intercultural places' that generate an environment that people of all cultures can have associative relationship with. This paper explores the notion of Cultural Literacy and the impacts of design decisions on the cultural life of Australia's diverse communities. Methods Cultural Literacy can be understood as the ability to read, understand, find significance, evaluate and compare local cultures. As Lefebvre [1996] states ""Cultural Literacy can be seen as the skill base associated with understanding both the encoding and decoding required to develop culturally meaningful products, places or programs"". The paper will present a cultural literacy framework for seeing, planning and designing through an intercultural lens. Results By understanding the communities multiple 'place narratives' and seeing things through an intercultural lens it is possible to plan and develop more inclusive and culturally sensitive public spaces. Conclusions As culture is what gives meaning to our lives then everything we do should have a cultural dimension. Therefore, all planning is or at least should be cultural, and be at the very centre of thinking about cities, not just about our social or civic life but also about the environment, infrastructure and economics of the city. The presenter will explore the potential of responsive planning and understanding the consequences and implications of urban planning on a community's cultural life and highlight a range of Cultural Literacy tools for planners and urban designers.",,Brecknock R.,
392,,2011,Article,"Urban design, socialization, and quality of life","Architecture as a discipline is essentially integrative: connecting past, present and future, drawing on art, science and the social sciences, balancing qualitative with quantitative factors. Good architecture and urban design contribute to making cities both functional and attractive to residents and visitors. While architecture is about the design of buildings, urban design is about the relationships between the buildings, the roads and spaces that they front, and the people who make use of them. The outstanding building projects are those that are not only visually stimulating, but are also sensitive and respectful of their surrounding developments and environment. A well-designed city takes into consideration this important relationship between buildings and the beauty of the city as a whole. Socialization is the process that prepares humans to function in social life. It should be re-iterated here that socialization is culturally relative - people in different cultures are socialized differently. The process of socializing or sociability in a city means acquiring the model of style life of that city. The process of socializing includes every daily activities of citizens' life. People have mutual relationship in this place and actualize it through presenting the municipal cultural and social activities and resolving the needs of each other. The municipal cultural and social realm has to develop the way of acquiring the necessary life skills gradually among the citizens.

399,,2010,Article,Cracow's contribution to the development of Polish geography (pre-1945) [Wkład ośrodka krakowskiego w rozwój Polskiej geografii (do roku 1945)],"The history of geography at the Jagiellonian University is a significant element of the history of this discipline in Poland and the world. The period of the Renaissance was of particular importance to the early development of Polish geography. As the awareness of geography increased, this discipline grew in importance in both science and culture. In Poland, the Cracow Academy played a leading role, and astronomy and geography were decisive in promoting the city internationally as an important academic centre. At the turn of the 15th/16th centuries, Cracow became a major European centre of geography, with the first regular geography lectures taking place in the city around 1490. 'The Cracow geography of the Polish Renaissance' is often quoted. Up until 1883, when the city of Lvov was established as another academic centre of geographical studies in Poland, the history of geography at the Jagiellonian University can be identified as the history of geography in Poland as a whole. Also in later eras, in particular until the outbreak of the Second World War, the University was very actively involved in the development of the history of geography and specialized in certain areas. It was expressed in an expedition programme undertaken by Ludomir Sawicki, as well as the development of a circle of people actively supporting ideas of urban and regional planning and geography of tourism. In a way, Cracow 'monopolised' these disciplines, giving no ground to other academic centres until 1939. The Cracow centre inspired numerous research initiatives in the area of geomorphology, population geography, urban geography and political geography. All that led to the establishment of the 'Cracow school of geography' in the period between the two world wars. It was chiefly associated with geomorphology, anthropogeography and applied geography (urban and regional planning, geography of tourism). The article indicates the main areas of influence that Cracow's academic centre had on Polish geography. The issues are partly chronologically listed: 1) raising awareness of geography, 2) counteracting attempts at eliminating geography from university curricula, 3) fostering the development of the modern understanding of geography, 4) promoting new research areas, 5) attempts at creating a model of expedition programmes, 6) the development of research staff, 7) organizational activity, 8) cooperation with the teachers' community, 9) developing the university curriculum in geography.",,"Jackowski A., Sołjan I.",

Meanwhile, Mongolian pastoralists can only afford a ""ger"" which is a wood-frame felt tent that can be assembled within hours.

Conversely, this research aims to identity the behavior and needs of the users by introducing the hypothesis that the behavioral patterns in any designed space relies on the designers personal perceptions and understanding of the behavioral and usage patterns of the individuals within it, the understanding of which positively reflects on both the spatial qualities and the individuals perception of it. To test the previous hypothesis, two urban plazas were selected, the Al-Hussien Sukaina Park located in a middle-income residential commercial district and the ""Culture A venue"" in a high-income commercial district. Through analytical studies and the utilization of questionnaires, the research concludes an overall preference of the simplicity of the former over the complexity of the design concept and elements of the latter. © Faculty of Engineering Alexandria University, Egypt.",Behavior patterns; Landscape perception; Plaza design,"Mahadin K.O., Ghanimeh A.A., Al-Najjar S., Al-Ejel N.",
415,,2004,Conference Paper,The development strategy of sustainable regional level water management plan: An agenda for Bangladesh perspectives.,"In common with current global concerns over wise use and effective management of water, the Government of Bangladesh is committed to exploring, developing and using its water resources to the benefit of all users. To this end the Ministry of Water Resources published the first National Water Policy in 1999,whereas the paper focuses the Regional Water Management Plan (RWMP) with the intention of guiding both public and private actions in the future for ensuring optimal development and management of water that benefits both individuals and the society at large. This Paper aims to ensure progress towards fulfilling national goals of economic development, poverty alleviation, food security, public health and safety, decent standard of living for the people and protection of the natural environment. The Plan is presented in three phases: in the short-term (2000-05) it is considered a firm plan of ongoing and new activities; in the medium-term (2006-10) it is an indicative plan, and in the long-term (2011-25) a perspective plan. Implementation of the plan is to be monitored regularly and it will be updated every five years (IWRM, 2002). Water is central to the way of life in Bangladesh. Indeed, the river systems, many of which emanate from outside the country, have shaped much of the history, economy, literature and rich culture of the people. However, with a burgeoning population of 129 million expected to rise to 181 million by 2025 and to 224 million by 2050 (IWRM, 2002), the country faces many challenges ahead in an era of increasing globalization. Rapid urbanization is expected with 40% of people living in the towns and major cities by 2025, and 60% by 2050 (WARPO, 2001). Poverty is still endemic with over half the population classified as poor. In addressing these and other related issues, this paper sets new paradigms for the water sector, which include: decentralized water management; cost sharing and cost recovery; private sector participation; community participation; nontraditional financing modalities; regulation separated from supply; and new rights, obligations and accountability.",,"Hafiz R., Chowdhury S., Sultana S.",
416,,2003,Review,The city in historical and contemporary perspective,"The scholarly works on urban history have yielded many views on urban origins and many definitions for the city. These are ranging from ecological thesis to religo-political views and from purely form-based to the functional structure. These studies while provide valuable accounts on the development of urban form; they overlook the socio- cultural dimension of the city. The city is the physical product of the people's social, religious and economic activities. This paper, first classifies the historical views on urban origins and urban morphology. It then discusses approaches to urban studies that focus not only at from but also at the processes, which influence shaping the city. Finally it advocates that an understanding of social, political, and economic environment of the urban community is the key issue in achieving a sustainable and coherent form.",City morphology; Culture; Definitions; History; Process and product; Theory; Urban environment; Urban origins; Urban revolution,Aboutorabi M.,
417,,2003,Article,Concept of the landscape in contemporary France during the controversy over the pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum,"This paper was written to illustrate how the landscape of Paris is shaped not solely by political forces, but also by the awareness and acceptance of the citizens of Paris. The case of the glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum is used to illustrate this process. When the pyramid was planned, the citizens themselves participated in a heated discussion on its construction. Now, more than a decade later, the pyramid is considered an emblem of the museum. By analysis of the controversy over the pyramid, we can consider how contemporary French society initially interpreted and eventually accepted a new artifact in the landscape of Paris. During the initial controversy, and also after construction, some critics called the project a mark of the despotism of the man who initiated the Louvre remodeling project, President François Mitterrand. However, it does not clarify the important questions about this controversy: which concept of the landscape of Paris conflicted with the glass pyramid, and how was the new building accepted nevertheless? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes the arguments about the symbolism and the harmony of the new landscape that were raised in the controversy. The arguments about the symbolism concerned the urban space of Paris and the shape of the pyramid. The spatial centrality of the Louvre in Paris was seriously considered. Under that condition, the interpretation of the ""Egyptian"" shape of the pyramid was always negative. It reflected a prejudiced, exclusionary frame of mind advocating a heterogeneous culture. The arguments about the harmony of the landscape concerned the Louvre and the material of the pyramid. The Louvre was interpreted as a ""palace."" It paradoxically suggested that the Louvre has played important roles in the history of modern France. The interpretation of the material of the pyramid emphasized its ""transparence."" It led to discrétion, meaning an absolute respect for the history that the Louvre had witnessed. This analysis allows us to consider the origin of the controversy. The Louvre was regarded as a symbol of the Republic, because of its history in the liberation during the Revolution. The Louvre Museum itself has functioned as a representation of French culture, in terms of collecting worldwide art works, interpreting them, and exhibiting them in the order which is required in French society. The glass pyramid was planned not only in the historical place, but also in the mythic place of the establishment of France. Accordingly, the origin of the dispute appears to be whether the new building intruded on ""French culture."" How was the new landscape accepted after that? To deny the interpretation of ""something foreign,"" the people who consented to the construction cited historical facts that justified the pyramid. The opponents of the project countered by quoting historical facts in their own arguments. As a consequence, the glass pyramid was linked to many reference points in French culture. In the background of the acceptance of a new landscape in Paris, there was an acquisition of cultural legitimacy.",Acceptance of a landscape; Controversy over the Louvre pyramid; References to French culture; Symbolism and harmony of landscape,Aramata M.,10.4157/grj.76.435
418,,2002,Conference Paper,Inter-organisational co-operation in improving access to activity centres by public transport,"The accessibility to city centres and large attraction parks increasingly becomes an issue of concern for location owners. They seek possibilities to offer transport services as an alternative to car use. In doing so, co-operation with public transport companies is important. These companies do not yet have the culture and opportunities to develop tailor-made services. Institutional changes yielding more market incentives and good information sharing should help to bridge the gaps between these parties. In particular a shared view on the service level to be offered, based on investigation of visitors' preferences, should be the starting point for inter-organisational co-operation.",,"Van Der Heijden R.E.C.M., Van Der Elst A., Veeneman W.W.",
421,,1997,Conference Paper,Overcoming politically induced resistance to payment for water in South Africa's urban areas,"The difficulties faced by South Africa in achieving reasonable levels of payment for water supplied in urban areas are in many respect similar to those applicable throughout the world. In some respects, however, the problems are very different. Decades of having to endure a politically offensive system has created negative attitudes in the bulk of the population towards authority, and indeed towards service providers. These attitudes will not easily change. As the majority of people had not real involvement in governance in the evolving political system during the nineteen eighties they increasingly regarded all authority as illegitimate. An illegitimate system quite naturally had to be resisted and replaced. The objective of resistance was to make the country ungovernable and hence open to change. By withholding, initially, housing rental repayments to the State and, later, services payments to local authorities a powerful weapon was brought into play. But with it came many other attitude changes, currently referred to as a 'culture of non-payment', which the new democratic government is now forced to grapple with. The degree to which the levels of payment for water services can be improved to acceptable levels will be dependent in a general sense upon government's success in changing attitudes and, in particular, on water authorities persuasiveness in inducing customers to take responsibility for paying for services rendered.",,Bath V.J.,

424,,1992,Article,Cultural importance of France [Le rayonnement culturel de la France],"France has long played a far more important role in the world than might have been expected for a country of its size and population. This influence on Europe and far beyond, dating from the Middle Ages, has in no way diminished today. French culture is at the heart of the matter: while only 150 million people in the world speak French as their native language, the powerful and far-reaching influence of French art, urban planning, cuisine and the French language itself is a source of pride to the French people. This phenomenon is rooted in France's geopolitical situation in Europe, which long required that its defence against its powerful neighbours be buttressed by alliances with more distant countries. It also has to do with France's history as a maritime power in the Mediterranean and later in the Atlantic, and the political and cultural legacy of the 8th-century Capetian dynasty and the subsequent first and second Empires and five Republics. Today, as France stands at the threshold of European integration, the French consider the issue of their country's cultural and political influence more important than its economic position or even its sovereignty. -from English summary",,Pitte J.R.,
