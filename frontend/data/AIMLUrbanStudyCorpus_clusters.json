Using census tracts as the units of analysis and controlling for several structural characteristics associated with crime, we find that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, violent crime is associated with concentrated disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and spatial lag of violent crime. Yet, the most important variable is the spatial lag of violent crime, followed by residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and concentrated disadvantage. In addition, we find that in Chicago, Illinois, violent crime is associated with immigration, owner-occupied housing, proportion in professional occupations, and proportion population with college degree or higher, as well as ethnic heterogeneity, total population, and the spatial lag for violent crime. Machine learning models suggest that for Chicago's violent crime, the most important variable is the spatial lag term for violent crime, followed by total population, immigration, college education or beyond, owner occupancy, ethnic heterogeneity, and employment in professional occupations. The findings for property crime are similar: in Milwaukee, we find that disadvantage, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, total population and spatial lag for property crime are significant predictors in the traditional regression models. However, the most important variable for property crime in Milwaukee is the spatial lag term, followed by total population, ethnic heterogeneity, residential stability and disadvantage. The statistically significant predictors of property crime in Chicago include immigration, owner-occupied housing units, living in the same house, proportion of workforce in professional occupations, college education and beyond, total population, and the spatial lag for property crime. In Chicago, the most important variable for property crime is the spatial lag term, then the total population, the proportion of individuals in professional occupations, concentrated immigration, college education and beyond, living in the same house, and the proportion of owner-occupied housing units. Urban planners must consider policies that can effectively reduce nearby crime and violence in all cities that experience high crime levels, but also design locally responsive policies that make sense within a local context: in Milwaukee, residential stability matters more for violent crime than for property crime, while in Chicago, total population is similarly important for both violent crime and property crime. In Milwaukee, ethnic heterogeneity is similarly important for violent and property crime, while in Chicago, ethnic heterogeneity is not a very important variable for violent crime and it is not a significant predictor of property crime. Therefore, urban policy must differently approach social disorganization indicators and support the nuances of the local context for urban planning and policy. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Crime analysis; Machine learning; Social disorganization","Authors":"Clancy K., Chudzik J., Snowden A.J., Guha S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2022.103604","x":4.9899997711,"y":4.0199999809,"KeyPhrases":["high crime level","Machine learning model","spatial lag term","census tract","residential stability"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"high crime level","score":0.5373933911},{"key-phrase":"nearby crime","score":0.5292503834},{"key-phrase":"violent crime","score":0.4988614023},{"key-phrase":"crime","score":0.4403498769},{"key-phrase":"urban policy","score":0.4321192801},{"key-phrase":"property crime","score":0.4156172872},{"key-phrase":"residential stability","score":0.4118703604},{"key-phrase":"urban American city","score":0.4102730751},{"key-phrase":"ethnic heterogeneity","score":0.4009175301},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3814273179},{"key-phrase":"census tract","score":0.3626086712},{"key-phrase":"Machine learning model","score":0.3512664735},{"key-phrase":"Urban planner","score":0.3436800838},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3181854188},{"key-phrase":"significant predictor","score":0.2886719704},{"key-phrase":"traditional regression model","score":0.2864534855},{"key-phrase":"social disorganization indicator","score":0.2772423029},{"key-phrase":"housing unit","score":0.270545423},{"key-phrase":"spatial lag term","score":0.2684072256},{"key-phrase":"contextual model","score":0.2386359721},{"key-phrase":"proportion population","score":0.2382688522},{"key-phrase":"spatial lag","score":0.2361772358},{"key-phrase":"important variable","score":0.2237230241},{"key-phrase":"concentrated disadvantage","score":0.2116827667},{"key-phrase":"violent","score":0.2046739012},{"key-phrase":"owner occupancy","score":0.2012598217},{"key-phrase":"traditional statistical method","score":0.1899294853},{"key-phrase":"total population","score":0.1875304878},{"key-phrase":"local context","score":0.1635113806},{"key-phrase":"college education","score":0.1609048247},{"key-phrase":"college degree","score":0.1582292169},{"key-phrase":"same house","score":0.1343762875},{"key-phrase":"professional occupation","score":0.119336307},{"key-phrase":"responsive policy","score":0.1107196808}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":2,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Subjective or objective measures of street environment, which are more effective in explaining housing prices?","Abstract":"Houses with better street design are found to relate to a price premium. Prior studies mainly present the street quality using objective indicators like tree counts and distance to parks with land use data, or most recently using the greenery view index extracted from street view imagery (SVI). We argue objective indicators cannot completely describe people's sense of a place, as perception is a highly subjective process. We hypothesize that subjective measures using visual surveys could capture more subtle human perceptions, thus providing stronger predictive power to housing prices. However, the role of subjectively measured street design qualities is less known due to the lack of large-scale perception data. To test our hypothesis, we first collected designers\u2019 perceptions on five urban design qualities from pairwise SVIs rankings in Shanghai with an online visual survey. Unlike the mainstream of using generic image features, we followed urban design theory and used rule-based features, i.e., about thirty streetscape elements extracted from SVIs to train machine learning (ML) models to predict subjective perceptions. The predictive power of five qualities versus ten selected individual streetscapes on housing price were compared using the hedonic price model. Besides the standard ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were also developed to account for the spatial dependence and heterogeneity effects. We found both subjectively measured design qualities and objective indicators outperformed housing structural attributes in explaining housing price. While the objective view indexes collectively explained more price variances, the five perceptions individually exhibited stronger strength. Third, less-studied perceptions like \u201chuman scale\u201d showed stronger strength than commonly studied \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cenclosure\u201d. Fourth, less-studied view indexes like \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cfence\u201d outperformed ubiquitous features like trees and buildings. Lastly, prior studies might have resulted in biased estimations due to ignoring the multicollinear issues between the sky, tree and building views. Our study addressed the effectiveness of incorporating subjective perceptions at a micro level to infer housing prices. correlations between subjective perceptions were strong while that of objective indicators were negligible, therefore subjective perceptions can complement the objective indicators. The findings provide important reference to decision makers when selecting street quality indicators to infer urban design, city planning and community and housing development plans. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Human Perception; Property value; Street design qualities; Street view imagery; Subjective measures","Authors":"Qiu W., Zhang Z., Liu X., Li W., Li X., Xu X., Huang X.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2022.104358","x":7.44,"y":-4.66,"KeyPhrases":["urban design quality","housing price","spatial regression","subjective measure","generic image feature"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban design quality","score":0.6357650757},{"key-phrase":"street design quality","score":0.5994634628},{"key-phrase":"street quality indicator","score":0.538451314},{"key-phrase":"urban design","score":0.5318589211},{"key-phrase":"street design","score":0.526835382},{"key-phrase":"urban design theory","score":0.4947713614},{"key-phrase":"individual streetscapes","score":0.4661763906},{"key-phrase":"spatial regression","score":0.4523841441},{"key-phrase":"street view imagery","score":0.4126548767},{"key-phrase":"design quality","score":0.4124642015},{"key-phrase":"city planning","score":0.4102708697},{"key-phrase":"street quality","score":0.4025642872},{"key-phrase":"subjective perception","score":0.3907330632},{"key-phrase":"housing price","score":0.3859379888},{"key-phrase":"land use data","score":0.3758170903},{"key-phrase":"streetscape element","score":0.3682511747},{"key-phrase":"geographical weighted regression","score":0.3654487133},{"key-phrase":"visual survey","score":0.341514796},{"key-phrase":"housing development plan","score":0.3402160406},{"key-phrase":"hedonic price model","score":0.3320726752},{"key-phrase":"subjective measure","score":0.3307057619},{"key-phrase":"structural attribute","score":0.3241962492},{"key-phrase":"building view","score":0.3231224418},{"key-phrase":"perception","score":0.3151389956},{"key-phrase":"online visual survey","score":0.302226454},{"key-phrase":"people's sense","score":0.2883511186},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2787047029},{"key-phrase":"spatial dependence","score":0.2771659791},{"key-phrase":"subjective process","score":0.2706358731},{"key-phrase":"price variance","score":0.2676595747},{"key-phrase":"large-scale perception","score":0.2629122734},{"key-phrase":"generic image feature","score":0.2551415563},{"key-phrase":"subtle human perception","score":0.2382233888},{"key-phrase":"greenery view index","score":0.2226480693},{"key-phrase":"predictive power","score":0.2197427899},{"key-phrase":"biased estimation","score":0.2175811827},{"key-phrase":"ubiquitous feature","score":0.2160216868},{"key-phrase":"objective indicator","score":0.1960311681},{"key-phrase":"objective view index","score":0.1928727776},{"key-phrase":"pairwise SVIs","score":0.1803492904},{"key-phrase":"price premium","score":0.1757589728},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneity effect","score":0.1635756046},{"key-phrase":"price","score":0.1482776701},{"key-phrase":"tree count","score":0.1407410651},{"key-phrase":"view index","score":0.1308706999},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.1261892021},{"key-phrase":"human scale","score":0.1173706949},{"key-phrase":"multicollinear issue","score":0.0543427877},{"key-phrase":"important reference","score":0.0279144123},{"key-phrase":"Prior study","score":0.0178941861},{"key-phrase":"micro level","score":0.0034418562}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":3,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms of street vending from the social sensing perspective: A comparison between law-enforcement reported and residents complain events","Abstract":"Street vending is an important part of the urban informal economy, especially in developing countries. How to control its negative externalities while augmenting its positive roles in the urban socio-economic system poses challenges to urban planning and governance. Existing studies have insufficiently addressed the issue largely due to the lack of high-frequent observation data for street vending events. By introducing socially sensed big data from the smart urban governance platform, as well as records from the \u201c12345\u201d urban problem complaint hotline of Jiangbei District, Ningbo, China, this paper examines and compares the spatiotemporal patterns and occurrence mechanisms of street vending events from both the urban managers' \u201ctop-down\u201d and the urban residents' \u201cbottom-up\u201d points of view. Statistical and machine learning models show that the distribution of street vending activities as sensed by the two subjects does not overlap. The former concentrates in central urban areas and work times, while the latter is scattered distributed in everyday life-related places and times. The findings reaffirm the existence of perception bias in social sensing data and show the potential for utilizing such bias to nudge better urban governance practices. Theoretically and empirically, this research has contributed to promoting the people-oriented transformation of urban governance. \u00a9 2022","Author Keywords":"High-frequency; Perception bias; Smart urban governance; Social sensing; Spatiotemporal big data; Street vending","Authors":"Li C., Huang Y., Shen Y., Xu L.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2022.103597","x":6.51,"y":-2.96,"KeyPhrases":["urban informal economy","big data","smart urban governance platform","urban problem complaint","vending"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban informal economy","score":0.526979208},{"key-phrase":"urban governance","score":0.5155804157},{"key-phrase":"smart urban governance platform","score":0.4987650514},{"key-phrase":"urban governance practice","score":0.4928679764},{"key-phrase":"urban problem complaint","score":0.4903584719},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4382810295},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.3945670724},{"key-phrase":"urban resident","score":0.3551278114},{"key-phrase":"central urban area","score":0.3530127704},{"key-phrase":"urban manager","score":0.33683604},{"key-phrase":"vending","score":0.3239561915},{"key-phrase":"governance","score":0.3104186058},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.2991326153},{"key-phrase":"high-frequent observation","score":0.2887217402},{"key-phrase":"economic system","score":0.2637164593},{"key-phrase":"perception bias","score":0.2576303184},{"key-phrase":"Jiangbei District","score":0.2287229002},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal pattern","score":0.2223516554},{"key-phrase":"everyday life","score":0.2181791812},{"key-phrase":"occurrence mechanism","score":0.1843385547},{"key-phrase":"such bias","score":0.1609389931},{"key-phrase":"work time","score":0.16006805},{"key-phrase":"important part","score":0.1260822117},{"key-phrase":"negative externality","score":0.1242277622},{"key-phrase":"positive role","score":0.1182422712},{"key-phrase":"former concentrate","score":0.0539513864}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":4,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Detecting individuals' spatial familiarity with urban environments using eye movement data","Abstract":"The spatial familiarity of environments is an important high-level user context for location-based services (LBS). Knowing users' familiarity level of environments is helpful for enabling context-aware LBS that can automatically adapt information services according to users' familiarity with the environment. Unlike state-of-the-art studies that used questionnaires, sketch maps, mobile phone positioning (GPS) data, and social media data to measure spatial familiarity, this study explored the potential of a new type of sensory data - eye movement data - to infer users' spatial familiarity of environments using a machine learning approach. We collected 38 participants' eye movement data when they were performing map-based navigation tasks in familiar and unfamiliar urban environments. We trained and cross-validated a random forest classifier to infer whether the users were familiar or unfamiliar with the environments (i.e., binary classification). By combining basic statistical features and fixation semantic features, we achieved a best accuracy of 81% in a 10-fold classification and 70% in the leave-one-task-out (LOTO) classification. We found that the pupil diameter, fixation dispersion, saccade duration, fixation count and duration on the map were the most important features for detecting users' spatial familiarity. Our results indicate that detecting users' spatial familiarity from eye tracking data is feasible in map-based navigation and only a few seconds (e.g., 5 s) of eye movement data is sufficient for such detection. These results could be used to develop context-aware LBS that adapt their services to users' familiarity with the environments. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Eye tracking; Machine learning; Pedestrian navigation; Random forest; Spatial familiarity; Wayfinding","Authors":"Liao H., Zhao W., Zhang C., Dong W., Huang H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101758","x":5.8,"y":-3.56,"KeyPhrases":["spatial familiarity","eye tracking data","random forest classifier","mobile phone positioning","navigation task"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"spatial familiarity","score":0.5551948547},{"key-phrase":"eye movement data","score":0.4576914907},{"key-phrase":"eye tracking data","score":0.4522095919},{"key-phrase":"unfamiliar urban environment","score":0.425989747},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone positioning","score":0.4065250158},{"key-phrase":"sensory data","score":0.3574647009},{"key-phrase":"navigation task","score":0.3434411883},{"key-phrase":"familiarity level","score":0.3246355057},{"key-phrase":"random forest classifier","score":0.3158420324},{"key-phrase":"binary classification","score":0.2986505032},{"key-phrase":"machine learning approach","score":0.2901171446},{"key-phrase":"familiarity","score":0.2677369416},{"key-phrase":"social medium data","score":0.2578162551},{"key-phrase":"semantic feature","score":0.2576300204},{"key-phrase":"sketch map","score":0.2431302518},{"key-phrase":"information service","score":0.2312784642},{"key-phrase":"aware LBS","score":0.226980269},{"key-phrase":"saccade duration","score":0.224722147},{"key-phrase":"basic statistical feature","score":0.2140037119},{"key-phrase":"fixation count","score":0.2132939398},{"key-phrase":"such detection","score":0.1796455383},{"key-phrase":"pupil diameter","score":0.1612146348},{"key-phrase":"important feature","score":0.1425190568},{"key-phrase":"fixation dispersion","score":0.1309783459},{"key-phrase":"user","score":0.1243353039},{"key-phrase":"art study","score":0.1089378372},{"key-phrase":"high-level user","score":0.1024712101},{"key-phrase":"new type","score":0.0812695771}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":5,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A comprehensive study of the COVID-19 impact on PM2.5 levels over the contiguous United States: A deep learning approach","Abstract":"We investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PM2.5 levels in eleven urban environments across the United States: Washington DC, New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Detroit, Phoenix, and Seattle. We estimate daily PM2.5 levels over the contiguous U.S. in March\u2013May 2019 and 2020, and leveraging a deep convolutional neural network, we find a correlation coefficient, an index of agreement, a mean absolute bias, and a root mean square error of 0.90 (0.90), 0.95 (0.95), 1.34 (1.24) \u03bcg\/m3, and 2.04 (1.87) \u03bcg\/m3, respectively. Results from Google Community Mobility Reports and estimated PM2.5 concentrations show a greater reduction of PM2.5 in regions with larger decreases in human mobility and those in which individuals remain in their residential areas longer. The relationship between vehicular PM2.5 (i.e., the ratio of vehicular PM2.5 to other sources of PM2.5) emissions and PM2.5 reductions (R = 0.77) in various regions indicates that regions with higher emissions of vehicular PM2.5 generally experience greater decreases in PM2.5.

The RF algorithm ranks independent variables from most to least important. Overall, the ranks suggested that residential infill development in the City of Los Angeles is significantly influenced by the physical conditions of property and neighborhood rather than socioeconomic characteristics. Diverse land uses, good housing mixes, and rail transit accessibility also, importantly, contributed to the infill development. This finding suggests that the city's planning efforts, such as the promotion of accessory dwelling unit (ADU) development and the expansion of rail transit, can create a virtuous circle for sustainable urban development. \u00a9 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Kim D., Shim J., Park J., Cho J., Kumar S.","DOI":"10.1061\/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000787","x":6.3699998856,"y":4.9299998283,"KeyPhrases":["residential infill development","random forest","rail transit accessibility","sustainable urban development","urban sprawl"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"residential infill development","score":0.6147330999},{"key-phrase":"urban sprawl","score":0.547591567},{"key-phrase":"sustainable urban development","score":0.4906527698},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4687108696},{"key-phrase":"city's planning effort","score":0.4303548932},{"key-phrase":"ML algorithms","score":0.3986684084},{"key-phrase":"good housing mix","score":0.3863737583},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3840355575},{"key-phrase":"infill development","score":0.3327186704},{"key-phrase":"accessory dwelling unit","score":0.2735866904},{"key-phrase":"infill","score":0.2575196028},{"key-phrase":"Diverse land","score":0.1985166967},{"key-phrase":"RF algorithm rank","score":0.1748586595},{"key-phrase":"Los Angeles","score":0.1666574031},{"key-phrase":"development","score":0.1530674398},{"key-phrase":"rail transit accessibility","score":0.1382637769},{"key-phrase":"rail transit","score":0.1379861087},{"key-phrase":"research gap","score":0.097694017},{"key-phrase":"virtuous circle","score":0.0556293875},{"key-phrase":"paper model","score":0.0392435789},{"key-phrase":"physical condition","score":0.0026108194}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":8,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Automatic Target Detection from Satellite Imagery Using Machine Learning","Abstract":"Object detection is a vital step in satellite imagery-based computer vision applications such as precision agriculture, urban planning and defense applications. In satellite imagery, object detection is a very complicated task due to various reasons including low pixel resolution of objects and detection of small objects in the large scale (a single satellite image taken by Digital Globe com-prises over 240 million pixels) satellite images. Object detection in satellite images has many challenges such as class variations, multiple objects pose, high variance in object size, illumination and a dense background. This study aims to compare the performance of existing deep learning algorithms for object detection in satellite imagery. We created the dataset of satellite imagery to perform object detection using convolutional neural network-based frameworks such as faster RCNN (faster region-based convolutional neural network), YOLO (you only look once), SSD (single-shot detector) and SIMRDWN (satellite imagery multiscale rapid detection with windowed networks). In addition to that, we also performed an analysis of these approaches in terms of accuracy and speed using the developed dataset of satellite imagery. The results showed that SIMRDWN has an accuracy of 97% on high-resolution images, while Faster RCNN has an accuracy of 95.31% on the standard resolution (1000 \u00d7 600). YOLOv3 has an accuracy of 94.20% on standard resolution (416 416) while on the other hand SSD has an accuracy of 84.61% on standard resolution (300 \u00d7 300). When it comes to speed and efficiency, YOLO is the obvious leader. In real-time surveillance, SIMRDWN fails. When YOLO takes 170 to 190 milliseconds to perform a task, SIMRDWN takes 5 to 103 milliseconds. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

However, due to the limitation of precision of equipment, there are big gaps to collect high-resolution DEM data. A practical idea is to recover high-resolution DEMs from easily obtained low-resolution DEMs, and this process is termed DEM super-resolution (SR). However, traditional DEM SR methods (e.g., bicubic interpolation) tend to over-smooth high-frequency regions on account of the operation of averaging local variations. With the recent development of machine learning, image SR methods have made great progress. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of terrain characters (e.g., peak and valley) and the huge difference between elevation field and image RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) value field, there are few works that apply image SR methods to the task of DEM SR. Therefore, this paper investigates the question of whether the state-of-the-art image SR methods are appropriate for DEM SR. More specifically, the traditional interpolation method and three excellent SR methods based on neural networks are chosen for comparison. Experimental results suggest that SRGAN (Super-Resolution with Generative Adversarial Network) presents the best performance on accuracy evaluation over a series of DEM SR experiments. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.

Despite its simplicity, this convenient concept has promoted significant advances in scientific research and policy making processes in the urban environmental community. Nevertheless, the oversimplification and inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy, inherited in the UHI concept, is increasingly manifest today in the continuously urbanized world. In this study, we conduct a holistic and in-depth survey of the inadequacy of the urban-rural dichotomy intrinsic to the definition of UHI, from theoretical, technical, and practical perspectives. In addition, in the light of recent research advances, we urge to radically reconceptualize UHI by proposing a novel paradigm by treating the total urban environment as a complex dynamic system. The new framework broadens the frontier of conventional urban environmental study by utilizing advanced techniques of complex systems and data sciences, including complex network theory, machine learning techniques, causal inference, etc. The reconceptualization of UHI is also expected to foster decision making and urban planning, and to avoid the one-sidedness of the singular and often too exclusive aim of heat mitigation. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Complex urban system; Environmental sustainability; Mitigation and adaptation; Networks; Urban heat island","Authors":"Wang Z.-H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103581","x":5.5300002098,"y":3.0599999428,"KeyPhrases":["urban heat island","complex network theory","urban-rural dichotomy","urban environmental study","machine learning technique"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban heat island","score":0.6178030968},{"key-phrase":"urban environmental study","score":0.5378850698},{"key-phrase":"total urban environment","score":0.5020034313},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5011794567},{"key-phrase":"urban-rural dichotomy","score":0.4449841976},{"key-phrase":"urbanized world","score":0.4448180199},{"key-phrase":"complex network theory","score":0.3970959783},{"key-phrase":"urban environmental community","score":0.3927549124},{"key-phrase":"heat mitigation","score":0.3361696005},{"key-phrase":"complex dynamic system","score":0.2963416576},{"key-phrase":"complex system","score":0.2775008976},{"key-phrase":"data science","score":0.2396113575},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.2209992707},{"key-phrase":"UHI concept","score":0.2207957357},{"key-phrase":"causal inference","score":0.1817518473},{"key-phrase":"scientific research","score":0.1598125249},{"key-phrase":"decision making","score":0.1557953358},{"key-phrase":"policy making processes","score":0.1400981098},{"key-phrase":"novel paradigm","score":0.1367262751},{"key-phrase":"dichotomy","score":0.1357388645},{"key-phrase":"research effort","score":0.113250941},{"key-phrase":"practical perspective","score":0.1028631777},{"key-phrase":"new framework","score":0.0843588412},{"key-phrase":"UHI","score":0.0841865242},{"key-phrase":"convenient concept","score":0.0712834597},{"key-phrase":"advanced technique","score":0.0454619974},{"key-phrase":"depth survey","score":0.0364854448},{"key-phrase":"recent research advance","score":0.0297727399},{"key-phrase":"manifest today","score":0.0228739791},{"key-phrase":"significant advance","score":0.0199453291},{"key-phrase":"Past decade","score":-0.027536165},{"key-phrase":"exclusive aim","score":-0.1259280443}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":11,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban Catchment-Scale Blue-Green-Gray Infrastructure Classification with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Images and Machine Learning Algorithms","Abstract":"Green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, is now widely used in sustainable urban development. An accurate mapping of GI is important to provide surface parameterization for model development. However, the accuracy and precision of mapping GI is still a challenge in identifying GI at the small catchment scale. We proposed a framework for blue-green-gray infrastructure classification using machine learning algorithms and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images that contained digital surface model (DSM) information. We used the campus of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, as a study case for our classification method. The UAV was a DJI Phantom 4 Multispectral, which measures the blue, green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared bands and DSM information. Six machine learning algorithms, i.e., fuzzy classifier, k-nearest neighbor classifier, Bayes classifier, classification and regression tree, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were used to classify blue (including water), green (including green roofs, grass, trees (shrubs), bare land), and gray (including buildings, roads) infrastructure. The highest kappa coefficient was observed for RF and the lowest was observed for SVM, with coefficients of 0.807 and 0.381, respectively. We optimized the sampling method based on a chessboard grid and got the optimal sampling interval of 11.6\u00a0m to increase the classification efficiency. We also analyzed the effects of weather conditions, seasons, and different image layers, and found that images in overcast days or winter days could improve the classification accuracy. In particular, the DSM layer was crucial for distinguishing green roofs and grass, and buildings and roads. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using UAV images in urban blue-green-gray infrastructure classification, and our infrastructure classification framework based on machine learning algorithms is effective. Our results could provide the basis for the future urban stormwater management model development and aid sustainable urban planning.

In the smart city context, crowd data, both in the form of their opinions and in the form of sensing data from their smartphones are very useful for scalable monitoring of resource demand and planning. Since these devices are portable, it is carried by almost every citizen, thus making them ubiquitous. However, the main bottleneck of such crowd intelligence-based services is data validation as opinions can be biased, influenced by some factors not relevant to the problem in focus. So, in this paper, a data validation framework utilizing machine learning techniques for mobile crowdsourcing applications is proposed. It is focused on MCS-based road monitoring applications. The idea of crowdsourced urban area road monitoring application(CURMA) presented in the paper is implemented and results show the crucial need for such data validation frameworks. \u00a9 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).","Author Keywords":"Crowd sourcing; Data validation; Machine learning; Naive Bayes","Authors":"Saha J., Roy S., Das T.K., Purkait K., Chowdhury C.","DOI":"10.1007\/s40031-022-00713-x","x":6.23,"y":-2.16,"KeyPhrases":["crowd data","smart city context","road monitoring application","data validation framework","machine learning technique"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"crowd data","score":0.591638267},{"key-phrase":"mobile crowdsourcing application","score":0.5548106432},{"key-phrase":"mobile crowd sourcing","score":0.5306744576},{"key-phrase":"road monitoring application","score":0.4353473485},{"key-phrase":"such crowd intelligence","score":0.4230088592},{"key-phrase":"smart city context","score":0.4170345664},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.4051252604},{"key-phrase":"data validation framework","score":0.3730939031},{"key-phrase":"data validation","score":0.3598179221},{"key-phrase":"urban area road","score":0.3416185975},{"key-phrase":"such data validation","score":0.321462214},{"key-phrase":"crowd","score":0.2952365279},{"key-phrase":"monitoring application","score":0.207392931},{"key-phrase":"opinion","score":0.2009036839},{"key-phrase":"scalable monitoring","score":0.1790176779},{"key-phrase":"Internet connection","score":0.1465399265},{"key-phrase":"resource demand","score":0.13367185},{"key-phrase":"crucial need","score":0.1129763946},{"key-phrase":"main bottleneck","score":0.0449269339},{"key-phrase":"promising paradigm","score":0.0216301568},{"key-phrase":"wide availability","score":0.0086879097}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":14,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A hybrid Daily PM2.5 concentration prediction model based on secondary decomposition algorithm, mode recombination technique and deep learning","Abstract":"Accurate and effective PM2.5 concentration prediction has important implications for public health and the ecological environment. To provide more accurate early warnings for haze prevention, urban planning, and people's travel planning, this paper proposes a new combined PM2.5 concentration prediction model. Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), followed by decomposition and reconstruction of the data by adaptive variational mode decomposition (AVMD) and sample entropy (SE), and then the reconstructed subseries are predicted by long and short-term memory networks (LSTM). The empirical analysis was carried out with three datasets from Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding, and the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The validity and robustness of the proposed model were verified, with R2 (0.982), RMSE (2.792), and MAPE (9.088%) being optimal in all comparison experiments. (2) The incorporation of secondary decomposition and pattern reorganization algorithms can effectively handle data with high volatility and non-linearity. (3) Compared with traditional machine learning models, the long and short-term memory network is more suitable for time series prediction. The model provides a novel and effective PM2.5 concentration prediction tool for the government and the public. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Adaptive variational mode decomposition; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Long short-term memory network; PM2.5 concentration prediction; Sample entropy","Authors":"Sun W., Xu Z.","DOI":"10.1007\/s00477-021-02100-2","x":-4.8499999046,"y":8.4099998474,"KeyPhrases":["time series prediction","novel and effective PM2","adaptive variational mode decomposition","ecological environment","sample entropy"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"time series prediction","score":0.4507976174},{"key-phrase":"5 concentration prediction","score":0.3927060962},{"key-phrase":"Accurate and effective PM2","score":0.3778151274},{"key-phrase":"haze prevention","score":0.3715869784},{"key-phrase":"empirical mode decomposition","score":0.3395423889},{"key-phrase":"adaptive variational mode decomposition","score":0.3395415545},{"key-phrase":"novel and effective PM2","score":0.3357958198},{"key-phrase":"accurate early warning","score":0.3057963252},{"key-phrase":"short-term memory","score":0.2930122614},{"key-phrase":"adaptive noise","score":0.2748269737},{"key-phrase":"pattern reorganization algorithms","score":0.2417171299},{"key-phrase":"traditional machine learning","score":0.2366156876},{"key-phrase":"sample entropy","score":0.2320210189},{"key-phrase":"decomposition","score":0.2068470418},{"key-phrase":"secondary decomposition","score":0.1984004378},{"key-phrase":"complete ensemble","score":0.1964262724},{"key-phrase":"high volatility","score":0.1837261617},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.1442687809},{"key-phrase":"ecological environment","score":0.1415396035},{"key-phrase":"empirical analysis","score":0.1404764056},{"key-phrase":"people's travel planning","score":0.1252313852},{"key-phrase":"original sequence","score":0.1018385217},{"key-phrase":"reconstructed subseries","score":0.0936359316},{"key-phrase":"concentration","score":0.0713825822},{"key-phrase":"public health","score":0.0310095027},{"key-phrase":"important implication","score":0.0117494306},{"key-phrase":"comparison experiment","score":0.0071505867}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":15,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Automatic identification of addresses: A systematic literature review","Abstract":"Address matching continues to play a central role at various levels, through geocoding and data integration from different sources, with a view to promote activities such as urban planning, location-based services, and the construction of databases like those used in census operations.

The main findings revealed a consistent move from more traditional approaches to deep learning methods based on semantics, encoder-decoder architectures, and attention mechanisms, as well as the very recent adoption of hybrid approaches making an increased use of spatial constraints and entities.

In recent years, many powerful general semantic segmentation models have emerged, but these models often perform poorly when transferred to remote sensing images because of the characteristics of remote sensing images. To this end, we propose a new deep learning network called Selective Nonlocal ResUNeXt++ (SNLRUX++) for building extraction. First, the cascaded multiscale feature fusion is proposed to transform the high-performance image classification network ResNeXt into the segmentation network ResUNeXt++. Second, selective nonlocal operation is designed to establish long-range dependencies while avoiding introducing excessive noise and computational effort. Finally, multiscale prediction is applied as deep supervision to accelerate training and convergence, and improves prediction performance of objects at different scales. The experimental results on two different remote sensing image datasets show the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Building extraction; convolution neural network; deep learning; high-resolution image; remote sensing","Authors":"Lei Y., Yu J., Chan S., Wu W., Liu X.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2021.3135705","x":9.16,"y":-5.82,"KeyPhrases":["segmentation network ResUNeXt","Building extraction","nonlocal","multiscale feature fusion","deep supervision"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"segmentation network ResUNeXt","score":0.4624685049},{"key-phrase":"general semantic segmentation model","score":0.4596794844},{"key-phrase":"multiscale feature fusion","score":0.4581051767},{"key-phrase":"classification network ResNeXt","score":0.4351634979},{"key-phrase":"new deep learning network","score":0.4321952462},{"key-phrase":"deep supervision","score":0.3990492523},{"key-phrase":"multiscale prediction","score":0.398406595},{"key-phrase":"Building extraction","score":0.387507081},{"key-phrase":"Selective Nonlocal ResUNeXt","score":0.3017553687},{"key-phrase":"image datasets","score":0.2835275531},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2630253732},{"key-phrase":"selective nonlocal operation","score":0.252512753},{"key-phrase":"image processing","score":0.2512928247},{"key-phrase":"nonlocal","score":0.2323358953},{"key-phrase":"generalization ability","score":0.2166941762},{"key-phrase":"resunext","score":0.1711842567},{"key-phrase":"high-performance image","score":0.1206432059},{"key-phrase":"different scale","score":0.1162010878},{"key-phrase":"prediction performance","score":0.1044979915},{"key-phrase":"range dependency","score":0.0916702077},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0738244727},{"key-phrase":"demographic analysis","score":0.0632952526},{"key-phrase":"excessive noise","score":0.0156376995},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0135093611},{"key-phrase":"computational effort","score":-0.0136416536},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":-0.0154505074},{"key-phrase":"experimental result","score":-0.0521286055}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":17,"Cited by":null,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Spatio-temporal prediction and factor identification of urban air quality using support vector machine","Abstract":"Accurate air quality prediction can provide better supervision and reference for management policies.

This study utilizes the support vector machine (SVM) method to predict air quality of unknown space and time. Extracted from a geographic information system (GIS), geographic features such as population, land use, economy, pollution sources, and terrain parameters were added to a time series. Temporal prediction was first executed in the reference stations, and the predicted air quality index (AQI) was then used to spatially infer the future AQI of unknown locations. Verification indicated high accuracy for short-term temporal prediction. Various meteorological and climatic effects were observed to be influential in seasonal difference. In the spatial inference stage, urbanization and city types were spatial features that appeared to impact air quality. Agriculture and forest use, transportation use, residential use, and economic factors were clearly correlated to AQIs, whereas population and labor force were not. This study establishes a prediction framework in northern Taipei based on SVM.

In this study, we employ a mobile monitoring method to collect PM2.5 and BC data in the city of Philadelphia, PA during the summer of 2019 and apply the Structure of Urban Landscapes (STURLA) methodology to examine relationships between urban structure and atmospheric pollution. We find that PM2.5 and BC vary by STURLA class, and some classes exhibit significant difference in pollution concentrations. We also find that the proportions in which STURLA components are present throughout the urban landscape can be used to predict the spatial distribution of urban air pollution. Among frequently sampled STURLA classes, gpl (grass, pavement, and low-rise buildings) hosted the highest PM2.5 concentrations on average (16.60 \u00b1 4.29 \u00b5g\/m3), while tgbwp (trees, grass, bare soil, water, pavement) hosted the highest BC concentrations (2.31 \u00b1 1.94 \u00b5g\/m3).

In the early stages of historical heritage conservation, the focus was on the museum-style concept for individual structures. At present, heritage area vitality is often adopted as a general conservation method to increase the vibrancy of such areas. However, it remains unclear whether urban morphological elements suitable for urban areas can be applied to heritage areas. This study uses ridge regression and LightGBM with multi-source big geospatial data to explore whether urban morphological elements that affect the vitality of heritage and urban areas are consistent or have different spatial distributions and daily variations. From a sample of 12 Chinese cities, our analysis shows the following results. First, factors affecting urban vitality differ from those influencing heritage areas. Second, factors influencing urban and heritage areas' vitality have diurnal variations and differ across cities. The overarching contribution of this study is to propose a quantitative and replicable framework for heritage adaptation, combining urban morphology and vitality measures derived from big geospatial data. This study also extends the understanding of forms of heritage areas and provides theoretical support for heritage conservation, urban construction, and economic development. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Heritage conservation; Historical heritage; Urban morphology; Urban planning; Vitality","Authors":"Wu J., Lu Y., Gao H., Wang M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101716","x":6.3099999428,"y":3.3599998951,"KeyPhrases":["heritage area vitality","ridge regression","urban morphological element","diurnal variation","big geospatial data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"heritage area vitality","score":0.6405459642},{"key-phrase":"urban morphology","score":0.5871444345},{"key-phrase":"urban morphological element","score":0.5126942396},{"key-phrase":"urban vitality","score":0.5039957166},{"key-phrase":"heritage adaptation","score":0.5011354089},{"key-phrase":"historical heritage conservation","score":0.4872821569},{"key-phrase":"heritage conservation","score":0.4839822054},{"key-phrase":"urban construction","score":0.4688026607},{"key-phrase":"heritage area","score":0.4638001323},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4527420104},{"key-phrase":"historical heritage","score":0.4235669076},{"key-phrase":"heritage","score":0.3828858733},{"key-phrase":"Chinese city","score":0.3326325119},{"key-phrase":"big geospatial data","score":0.3306930065},{"key-phrase":"style concept","score":0.2390309572},{"key-phrase":"different spatial distribution","score":0.2313433588},{"key-phrase":"ridge regression","score":0.231014058},{"key-phrase":"individual structure","score":0.2176116854},{"key-phrase":"economic development","score":0.2136654258},{"key-phrase":"diurnal variation","score":0.2133067995},{"key-phrase":"such area","score":0.2071195692},{"key-phrase":"vitality measure","score":0.1906193346},{"key-phrase":"daily variation","score":0.1552650928},{"key-phrase":"vitality","score":0.1222195029},{"key-phrase":"quantitative and replicable framework","score":0.1008557677},{"key-phrase":"societal creativity","score":0.0991519541},{"key-phrase":"overarching contribution","score":0.0943744779},{"key-phrase":"social benefit","score":0.0659762174},{"key-phrase":"general conservation method","score":0.0637313947},{"key-phrase":"theoretical support","score":0.0124709047},{"key-phrase":"early stage","score":-0.0472477153}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":21,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Do land policies make a difference? A data-driven approach to trace effects on urban form in France and Germany","Abstract":"Against the backdrop of rapidly expanding urban structures, land policies in many countries have been adapted to contain and redirect growth to existing urban structures. However, obstacles remain to measure the effects of policies. In the meantime, geoinformation technologies have given rise to a wide range of approaches to measure and describe urban form. Nevertheless, its application for the assessment of land policy has a high, but not yet fully exploited, potential. It is thus the aim of this research to address and investigate the options of spatial analysis and machine learning in particular to analyse urban form from a land policy perspective. To do so, we develop urban metrics informed by urban planning and land readjustment policies of two countries describing urban form on different spatial levels. We therefore formulate hypotheses on causal relations between policy and form. Based on the metrics, we apply the random forest algorithm to classify the building stock of the region. We then extract the residential areas, those with single-family houses, as this is where the effects of the policy are considered most visible. In a next step, we use random forest to predict the nationality of a building. Through variable importance measures, we identify and discuss urban morphological differences between the two countries and test the hypotheses on effects of land policies. We develop and test the approach for the French-German city-region of Strasbourg using OpenStreetMap data. We identify significant differences in the building coverage ratios, which tend to be higher in Germany. This can be linked to differences in planning regulations. Furthermore, German residential areas appear to be more diverse in urban form. Differences in land readjustment policies have proven to be plausible here, as French policies favour strong actors that develop residential areas more uniformly. In Germany, policies favour fragmented ownership-oriented development of residential areas. The metrics and the applied algorithm for building classification have proven to be robust in terms of data heterogeneity and have shown high levels of accuracy. They could also be successfully used for tracing causal relations. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.","Author Keywords":"Comparative; land policy; random forest; urban analytics; urban form","Authors":"Jehling M., Hecht R.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808321995818","x":6.1300001144,"y":3.7200000286,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","random forest","significant difference","German residential area","French policy favour"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5992255807},{"key-phrase":"urban structure","score":0.5715630054},{"key-phrase":"urban morphological difference","score":0.5114078522},{"key-phrase":"German residential area","score":0.4962458313},{"key-phrase":"spatial analysis","score":0.4921703339},{"key-phrase":"urban form","score":0.4491322041},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4357465506},{"key-phrase":"residential area","score":0.4185712934},{"key-phrase":"land policy","score":0.4059762061},{"key-phrase":"OpenStreetMap data","score":0.3989568651},{"key-phrase":"random forest algorithm","score":0.3976263702},{"key-phrase":"land readjustment policy","score":0.3923416436},{"key-phrase":"land policy perspective","score":0.3731554747},{"key-phrase":"French-German city","score":0.3727150559},{"key-phrase":"geoinformation technology","score":0.3637232482},{"key-phrase":"building coverage ratio","score":0.3264769018},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3199650049},{"key-phrase":"different spatial level","score":0.28230685},{"key-phrase":"variable importance measure","score":0.2565658391},{"key-phrase":"data heterogeneity","score":0.2335076034},{"key-phrase":"single-family house","score":0.218789041},{"key-phrase":"policy favour","score":0.1822558939},{"key-phrase":"French policy favour","score":0.1791143417},{"key-phrase":"fragmented ownership","score":0.1627944708},{"key-phrase":"causal relation","score":0.1319064498},{"key-phrase":"significant difference","score":0.1200221777},{"key-phrase":"policy","score":0.0959834307},{"key-phrase":"next step","score":0.0807280689},{"key-phrase":"many country","score":0.0714733675},{"key-phrase":"wide range","score":0.0671822578},{"key-phrase":"building stock","score":0.0595363379},{"key-phrase":"high level","score":0.0556587055},{"key-phrase":"readjustment","score":0.0051503507},{"key-phrase":"strong actor","score":0.0044211121}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":22,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2022,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"GCN2CDD: A Commercial District Discovery Framework via Embedding Space Clustering on Graph Convolution Networks","Abstract":"Modern enterprises attach much attention to the selection of commercial locations.

However, existing deep learning-based change detection methods suffer from limited accuracy, mainly due to the information loss and inadequate capability in feature extraction. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel deeply supervised attention-guided network (DSA-Net) for BCD tasks in high-resolution images. In the DSA-Net, we innovatively introduce a spatial attention mechanism-guided cross-layer addition and skip-connection (CLA-Con-SAM) module to aggregate multi-level contextual information, weaken the heterogeneity between raw image features and difference features, and direct the network's attention to changed regions. We also introduce an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module to extract multi-scale features. To further improve detection performance, we implement a new deep supervision module to enhance the ability of middle layers to extract more distinctive features. We conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on the two publicly available datasets, i.e., the LEVIR-CD and the WHU Building datasets. Compared with the competing methods, the proposed DSA-Net achieves the best performance in all evaluation metrics. The efficiency analysis reveals that the proposed DSA-Net achieves a great balance between BCD performance and complexity\/efficiency, with faster convergence and higher robustness. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Building change detection; CLA-Con-SAM; Deep learning; Deep supervision; DSA-Net","Authors":"Ding Q., Shao Z., Huang X., Altan O.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jag.2021.102591","x":9.33,"y":-5.89,"KeyPhrases":["Building change detection","new deep supervision module","atrous spatial pyramid","deep learning","cross-layer addition"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Building change detection","score":0.636351347},{"key-phrase":"change detection method","score":0.4516389668},{"key-phrase":"new deep supervision module","score":0.343011111},{"key-phrase":"supervised attention","score":0.320356667},{"key-phrase":"multi-scale feature","score":0.3184619248},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.3168422282},{"key-phrase":"difference feature","score":0.2928103805},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2802990377},{"key-phrase":"atrous spatial pyramid","score":0.2788610458},{"key-phrase":"multi-level contextual information","score":0.2695536315},{"key-phrase":"cross-layer addition","score":0.2424308658},{"key-phrase":"distinctive feature","score":0.2118287981},{"key-phrase":"spatial attention mechanism","score":0.2066513896},{"key-phrase":"detection performance","score":0.1954230219},{"key-phrase":"raw image feature","score":0.1851238757},{"key-phrase":"extensive attention","score":0.183705464},{"key-phrase":"feature extraction","score":0.1793648005},{"key-phrase":"network's attention","score":0.1768931001},{"key-phrase":"WHU Building datasets","score":0.1751226187},{"key-phrase":"information loss","score":0.1694778502},{"key-phrase":"middle layer","score":0.1501902789},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution image","score":0.1422466189},{"key-phrase":"available datasets","score":0.1353638917},{"key-phrase":"limited accuracy","score":0.1304671764},{"key-phrase":"BCD task","score":0.1129215062},{"key-phrase":"great balance","score":0.0760124624},{"key-phrase":"crucial role","score":0.0746733919},{"key-phrase":"DSA","score":0.0702200308},{"key-phrase":"inadequate capability","score":0.0140260225},{"key-phrase":"quantitative and qualitative experiment","score":0.0132616982},{"key-phrase":"BCD","score":0.0129106287},{"key-phrase":"BCD performance","score":0.0122243771},{"key-phrase":"efficiency analysis","score":-0.0038227383}]},{"Cluster":25,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":24,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban soils as a spatial indicator of quality for urban socio-ecological systems","Abstract":"The development of criteria and indicators to quantify the transition to sustainability of the urban socio-ecological systems quality is determinant for planning policies and the 21st century urban agenda.

Meanwhile, machine learning methods were employed to study some interactions between the different dimensions that constitute an urban socio-ecosystem that caused these variations. We proposed a methodology that considered two phases: a) field work to collect data on 300 soil samples; laboratory analysis to measure the concentrations of 24 macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients; and the design of geophysical, spectral, and urban co-variables; b) statistical and geo-informatics analysis, where multivariate analysis grouped the elements into factors; and, machine learning integrated with co-variables was applied to derive the intensity of each factor across the city. Multivariate statistics described the variation in soil co-concentrations with a moderate percentage (42%). Four factors were determined that grouped some of the analyzed elements, as follows: F1 (Zn, S, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr), F2 (Ba, Ag, K, In, and Mg), F3 (B, V, Li, and Sr), and F4 (Si and Mn).

The Concepci\u00f3n metropolitan area (CMA) constitutes one of the most representative samples of that dynamic. The wildfire risk in the CMA was addressed by establishing a model of five categories (near zero, low, moderate, high, and very high) that represent discernible thresholds in fire occurrence, using geospatial data and satellite images describing anthropic-biophysical factors that trigger fires. Those were used to deliver a model of fire hazard using machine learning algorithms, including principal component analysis and Kohonen self-organizing maps in two experimental scenarios: Only native forest and only forestry plantation. The model was validated using fire hotspots obtained from the forestry government organization. The results indicated that 12.3% of the CMA's surface area has a high and very high risk of a forest fire, 29.4% has a moderate risk, and 58.3% has a low and very low risk. Lastly, the observed main drivers that have deepened this risk were discussed: First, the evident proximity between the increasing urban areas with exotic forestry plantations and, second, climate change that threatens triggering more severe and large wildfires because of human activities. \u00a9 2021 Edilia Jaque Castillo et al.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Jaque Castillo E., Fern\u00e1ndez A., Fuentes Robles R., Ojeda C.G.","DOI":"10.5194\/nhess-21-3663-2021","x":12.5200004578,"y":3.3800001144,"KeyPhrases":["Wildfire risk","machine learning algorithm","Chilean metropolitan area","urban interface","anthropic-biophysical factor"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Wildfire risk","score":0.5709745288},{"key-phrase":"severe and large wildfire","score":0.4716400206},{"key-phrase":"fire occurrence","score":0.4205896258},{"key-phrase":"forest fire","score":0.4140523076},{"key-phrase":"geospatial data","score":0.3591566682},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3485797942},{"key-phrase":"urban interface","score":0.3361759186},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3283051848},{"key-phrase":"fire hazard","score":0.3174683452},{"key-phrase":"principal component analysis","score":0.3088183999},{"key-phrase":"Chilean metropolitan area","score":0.3073492646},{"key-phrase":"fire hotspot","score":0.2714053988},{"key-phrase":"forestry government organization","score":0.2645770609},{"key-phrase":"native forest","score":0.2559791803},{"key-phrase":"forestry plantation","score":0.2367115617},{"key-phrase":"fire","score":0.2321418673},{"key-phrase":"climate change","score":0.2193191051},{"key-phrase":"exotic forestry plantation","score":0.2179176658},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan area","score":0.1840652674},{"key-phrase":"anthropic-biophysical factor","score":0.1785208583},{"key-phrase":"satellite image","score":0.150052622},{"key-phrase":"evident proximity","score":0.1307960153},{"key-phrase":"high risk","score":0.1106833369},{"key-phrase":"Kohonen self","score":0.0966804326},{"key-phrase":"human activity","score":0.0824210271},{"key-phrase":"moderate risk","score":0.0822151303},{"key-phrase":"CMA's surface area","score":0.0801340118},{"key-phrase":"discernible threshold","score":0.0600191429},{"key-phrase":"low risk","score":0.0587548725},{"key-phrase":"CMA","score":0.0581527427},{"key-phrase":"experimental scenario","score":0.0453525186},{"key-phrase":"representative sample","score":0.0359797478},{"key-phrase":"main driver","score":-0.0302006863},{"key-phrase":"strong presence","score":-0.0400141701}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":26,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Machine-learning models to replicate large-eddy simulations of air pollutant concentrations along boulevard-type streets","Abstract":"Running large-eddy simulations (LESs) can be burdensome and computationally too expensive from the application point of view, for example, to support urban planning. In this study, regression models are used to replicate modelled air pollutant concentrations from LES in urban boulevards. We study the performance of regression models and discuss how to detect situations where the models are applied outside their training domain and their outputs cannot be trusted. Regression models from 10 different model families are trained and a cross-validation methodology is used to evaluate their performance and to find the best set of features needed to reproduce the LES outputs. We also test the regression models on an independent testing dataset. Our results suggest that in general, log-linear regression gives the best and most robust performance on new independent data. It clearly outperforms the dummy model which would predict constant concentrations for all locations (multiplicative minimum RMSE (mRMSE) of 0.76 vs. 1.78 of the dummy model). Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to detect concept drift, i.e. situations where the model is applied outside its training domain and a new LES run may be necessary to obtain reliable results. Regression models can be used to replace LES simulations in estimating air pollutant concentrations, unless higher accuracy is needed. In order to have reliable results, it is however important to do the model and feature selection carefully to avoid overfitting and to use methods to detect the concept drift. \u00a9 2021 Moritz Lange et al.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Lange M., Suominen H., Kurppa M., J\u00e4rvi L., Oikarinen E., Savvides R., Puolam\u00e4ki K.","DOI":"10.5194\/gmd-14-7411-2021","x":-5.0,"y":7.9400000572,"KeyPhrases":["large-eddy simulation","regression model","air pollutant concentration","urban planning","concept drift"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"large-eddy simulation","score":0.4478822052},{"key-phrase":"air pollutant concentration","score":0.4408197403},{"key-phrase":"regression model","score":0.3914022446},{"key-phrase":"linear regression","score":0.3797648847},{"key-phrase":"regression","score":0.3527259827},{"key-phrase":"training domain","score":0.3225125074},{"key-phrase":"dummy model","score":0.3213968277},{"key-phrase":"cross-validation methodology","score":0.3044593632},{"key-phrase":"feature selection","score":0.3002697825},{"key-phrase":"concept drift","score":0.2749685049},{"key-phrase":"LES simulation","score":0.2670338154},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2551580966},{"key-phrase":"independent testing dataset","score":0.2382227182},{"key-phrase":"new independent data","score":0.2079052925},{"key-phrase":"multiplicative minimum RMSE","score":0.203426227},{"key-phrase":"different model family","score":0.1754824817},{"key-phrase":"urban boulevard","score":0.1716804802},{"key-phrase":"reliable result","score":0.1681699753},{"key-phrase":"application point","score":0.1247695386},{"key-phrase":"robust performance","score":0.1217277497},{"key-phrase":"LES output","score":0.1090016887},{"key-phrase":"constant concentration","score":0.1025443524},{"key-phrase":"new LES run","score":0.0988720804},{"key-phrase":"LES","score":0.0590383261}]},{"Cluster":26,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":27,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Landslide susceptibility mapping using artificial neural network tuned by metaheuristic algorithms","Abstract":"As a frequent natural disaster, landslides incur significant economic and human losses worldwide. The main idea of this paper is to propose novel integrative models for landslide susceptibility evaluation in a prone area of Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari Province in Iran. To do this, four metaheuristic techniques, namely chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA), crow search algorithm (CSA), satin bowerbird optimization (SBO), and water cycle algorithm (WCA) are used to supervise the training of an artificial neural network (ANN). A spatial database is created by 170 historical landslides and 14 most common conditioning factors. The models are optimized in terms of hyper-parameters and elite ones are then used to produce the susceptibility maps. During the training phase, all models could acquire a reliable understanding of the landslide pattern. The obtained accuracy index of area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUROC) showed that the maps produced by the WCA-ANN (AUROC = 0.925) and SBO-ANN (AUROC = 0.900) are more accurate than those of the ChOA-ANN (AUROC = 0.851) and CSA-ANN (AUROC = 0.855). Considering this assessment, the suggested hybrid models are reliable enough for landslide susceptibility modeling. Accordingly, the generated susceptibility map can be used for urban planning and generating alert systems over the studied area. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Landslide; Machine learning; Metaheuristic optimization; Natural hazard; Susceptibility modeling","Authors":"Mehrabi M., Moayedi H.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12665-021-10098-7","x":13.0500001907,"y":3.6400001049,"KeyPhrases":["landslide susceptibility modeling","artificial neural network","urban planning","satin bowerbird optimization","metaheuristic technique"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"landslide susceptibility modeling","score":0.6330942512},{"key-phrase":"landslide susceptibility evaluation","score":0.6268544793},{"key-phrase":"landslide pattern","score":0.4853222966},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.4552119374},{"key-phrase":"metaheuristic technique","score":0.3641733527},{"key-phrase":"historical landslide","score":0.3634763956},{"key-phrase":"landslide","score":0.3268502951},{"key-phrase":"chimp optimization algorithm","score":0.3240812421},{"key-phrase":"susceptibility map","score":0.323166132},{"key-phrase":"frequent natural disaster","score":0.3203510046},{"key-phrase":"crow search algorithm","score":0.2984693348},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2602255344},{"key-phrase":"accuracy index","score":0.2501736283},{"key-phrase":"water cycle algorithm","score":0.2076302469},{"key-phrase":"characteristic curve","score":0.2044870108},{"key-phrase":"alert system","score":0.1641188562},{"key-phrase":"novel integrative model","score":0.1516299844},{"key-phrase":"spatial database","score":0.1479592621},{"key-phrase":"prone area","score":0.1400085688},{"key-phrase":"satin bowerbird optimization","score":0.1284710318},{"key-phrase":"hyper-parameters and elite one","score":0.1274602562},{"key-phrase":"training phase","score":0.1069134623},{"key-phrase":"common conditioning factor","score":0.1047252268},{"key-phrase":"hybrid model","score":0.1034190655},{"key-phrase":"reliable understanding","score":0.0763978511},{"key-phrase":"economic and human loss","score":0.0684648454},{"key-phrase":"Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari","score":0.0611804724},{"key-phrase":"main idea","score":-0.0038013998},{"key-phrase":"AUROC","score":-0.0055860244}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":28,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Artificial intelligence in urban forestry\u2014A systematic review","Abstract":"Environmental quality and the citizens' well-being largely depend on the urban forests. But managing this natural capital is challenging for its biological complexity and interactions with other environmental, social, and economic aspects of the cities. In line with the current digital revolution with the rise of Smart Cities, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more common, including in urban forestry. In this systematic review, we evaluated 67 studies on the interplay between AI and urban forestry surveyed on Science Direct and Scopus to provide an overview of the state of the art and identify new research avenues. The sample includes studies in 23 countries and 85 cities, including 5 megacities, comprising the remote assessment of canopy cover and species distribution; ecosystem services assessment; management practices; and socioeconomic aspects of urban forestry. Most studies focused on extant urban forests, with few examples evaluating temporal trends, and only one focused on future scenarios despite the predictive potential of AI. A total of 22 AI methods were employed in these studies. Only half of them point to clear advantages of the chosen methods, such as robustness against missing data, overfitting, collinearity, non-linearity, non-normality, the combination of discrete and continuous variables, and higher accuracy. The choice of these methods depends on the various combinations of aim, timescale, data type, and data source. The application of AI in urban forestry is in full growth and will support decision making to improve livability in the cities. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Governance; Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Nature-based solutions; Urban planning; Urban trees","Authors":"C\u00e9sar de Lima Ara\u00fajo H., Silva Martins F., Tucunduva Philippi Cortese T., Locosselli G.M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ufug.2021.127410","x":-5.8400001526,"y":7.0500001907,"KeyPhrases":["urban forestry","AI method","Smart Cities","ecosystem service assessment","discrete and continuous variable"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban forestry","score":0.5896594524},{"key-phrase":"extant urban forest","score":0.5845413208},{"key-phrase":"urban forest","score":0.5410816073},{"key-phrase":"ecosystem service assessment","score":0.4331206381},{"key-phrase":"forestry","score":0.4173020124},{"key-phrase":"AI method","score":0.3507972956},{"key-phrase":"AI","score":0.3469656706},{"key-phrase":"Smart Cities","score":0.3263143897},{"key-phrase":"Artificial Intelligence","score":0.2852191329},{"key-phrase":"Environmental quality","score":0.283681035},{"key-phrase":"remote assessment","score":0.246647656},{"key-phrase":"canopy cover","score":0.184989661},{"key-phrase":"biological complexity","score":0.1806675494},{"key-phrase":"predictive potential","score":0.1586613506},{"key-phrase":"discrete and continuous variable","score":0.1471312642},{"key-phrase":"new research avenue","score":0.1455892026},{"key-phrase":"systematic review","score":0.1415672749},{"key-phrase":"economic aspect","score":0.1370739192},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic aspect","score":0.1296079159},{"key-phrase":"future scenario","score":0.123606503},{"key-phrase":"data source","score":0.1223731935},{"key-phrase":"full growth","score":0.1179567575},{"key-phrase":"natural capital","score":0.1079903692},{"key-phrase":"few example","score":0.1055030525},{"key-phrase":"current digital revolution","score":0.1044144183},{"key-phrase":"Science Direct","score":0.0995693728},{"key-phrase":"management practice","score":0.0872163475},{"key-phrase":"data type","score":0.0851404518},{"key-phrase":"temporal trend","score":0.0670027211},{"key-phrase":"various combination","score":0.0390632898},{"key-phrase":"specie distribution","score":-0.0146124465}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":29,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Classification of the influence of urban canyon geometry and reflectance on seasonal solar irradiation in three European cities","Abstract":"The study presents a methodological framework for simulating, analyzing and classifying the seasonal solar exposure and irradiation uniformity of symmetrical urban canyons in three European cities with different latitudes: Athens, Paris and Helsinki.

While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models: (1) most existing approaches solely capture spatial correlations among neighbors on predefined graph structure, and genuine relation may be missing due to the incomplete graph connections; and (2) existing methods are defective to capture the temporal trends because the recurrent and stacking structure employed in these methods suffers from the long-range temporal dependency vanquish problem. To overcome the difficulty in multistep prediction and further capture the dynamic spatialoral dependencies of traffic flows, we propose a new traffic speed prediction framework for multiscale graph attention networks (MS-GATNs). In particular, MS-GATNs is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture that learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multiheads attention mechanism is introduced to empower our model with the capability of capturing complex nonstationary temporal dynamics. Experiments on real-world traffic data sets demonstrate that MS-GATNs outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in long-term forecasting. \u00a9 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":"Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Graph convolution; Traffic speed prediction","Authors":"Wu X., Fang J., Liu Z., Wu X.","DOI":"10.1061\/JTEPBS.0000600","x":5.1,"y":-2.33,"KeyPhrases":["Accurate traffic forecasting","multiscale graph attention","dynamic and spatial dependency","gatns","temporal trend"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Accurate traffic forecasting","score":0.5513629913},{"key-phrase":"multiscale graph attention","score":0.4310786724},{"key-phrase":"crucial urban data mining","score":0.4215674102},{"key-phrase":"long-range temporal dependency vanquish","score":0.406822145},{"key-phrase":"multistep prediction","score":0.3782057762},{"key-phrase":"long-term forecasting","score":0.3762482703},{"key-phrase":"real-world traffic","score":0.3754943609},{"key-phrase":"traffic flow","score":0.345698446},{"key-phrase":"temporal trend","score":0.3364510834},{"key-phrase":"dynamic and spatial dependency","score":0.3333280683},{"key-phrase":"congestion warning","score":0.3257088661},{"key-phrase":"region-wise geographical dependency","score":0.3120394349},{"key-phrase":"new traffic speed","score":0.3060529232},{"key-phrase":"nonstationary temporal dynamic","score":0.2979106605},{"key-phrase":"spatial correlation","score":0.2955247164},{"key-phrase":"transportation scheduling","score":0.2897907495},{"key-phrase":"prediction framework","score":0.2789954245},{"key-phrase":"incomplete graph connection","score":0.2747901082},{"key-phrase":"neural architecture","score":0.274725318},{"key-phrase":"citywide network","score":0.2724392414},{"key-phrase":"spatial semantics","score":0.2235999703},{"key-phrase":"predefined graph structure","score":0.2189135551},{"key-phrase":"structured graph","score":0.2156619877},{"key-phrase":"dynamic spatialoral dependency","score":0.213116765},{"key-phrase":"multiheads attention mechanism","score":0.1795082986},{"key-phrase":"gatns","score":0.1738318056},{"key-phrase":"global perspective","score":0.0900995582},{"key-phrase":"current model","score":0.0711737871},{"key-phrase":"previous work","score":0.0681019574},{"key-phrase":"MS","score":0.0637057424},{"key-phrase":"genuine relation","score":0.0414849147},{"key-phrase":"further capture","score":0.0331777409},{"key-phrase":"existing approach","score":0.0156040937},{"key-phrase":"art baseline","score":0.0122568011},{"key-phrase":"key limitation","score":0.0090225618},{"key-phrase":"significant effort","score":-0.1145615131}]},{"Cluster":9,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":31,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Quantifying physical and psychological perceptions of urban scenes using deep learning","Abstract":"The complicated relationship between urban scenes and public perceptions has long been a concern in many disciplines. Previous studies have lacked human-oriented technical paths and high-throughput datasets to quantify physical and psychological perceptions in different land-use scenarios. This paper adopts a novel transfer learning approach to quantify the six types of landsense indices (LSIs) as psychological perception metrics and employs panoptic segmentation to parameterize the view index (VI) and the number of foreground instances (NFIs) as physical perception measures. Then, a quantitative analysis is conducted in Beijing's six Ring Road areas, and the connections between people's physical and psychological perceptions of heterogeneous land use are explored. The landsense maps can depict the distribution of LSIs and facilitate the understanding of complex perceptions distributed at a large scale. The regression model shows that natural landscapes (trees, grasses, and mountains) in the Beijing built-up area exhibit an overall positive performance. Moreover, for several block-level land uses, industrial scenery is related to overall negative psychological feelings. Parks and green spaces are positively related to psychological perceptions, because of the greater exposure opportunities to natural landscapes for residents. The framework in this research has potential in assisting urban planning and land-use management, and it enriches the datasets with extensive information, thereby improving the psychological perceptions of urban scenes from residents\u2019 perspectives.

In recent years, researchers have started relying more on photo-based, geotagged social data, which offer insights about tourists, popular hotspots, and mobility patterns. However, distinguishing between tourists and locals from this data is problematic since residence information is often not provided. While previous studies rely on heuristic (e.g., period of stay) and probabilistic (Shannon entropy) approaches, this paper proposes a method for classifying tourists and residents based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and considering parameters that could explain the variability between the two (e.g., weather, mobility, and photo content). This approach was applied to Flickr users\u2019 geotagged photos taken in Tokyo\u2019s 23 special wards from July 2008 to December 2019. The results show that stacked ensemble (SE) models are superior to models based on five supervised-learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), distributed random forest (DRF), deep learning (DL), and extremely randomized trees (XRT). Temporal entropy (TEN), mobility on workdays, and frequent visits to amusement venues and crowded places influenced how users were classified. While temporal distribution showed similar monthly\/hourly patterns, spatial distribution varied. The proposed approach might pave the way for scholars to carry out future tourism research on different topics and subsequently support policymakers in the decision-making process, specifically in urban settings. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Big data; Classification; Flickr; Geotagged photos; Locals; Machine learning; Tokyo; Tourists","Authors":"Derdouri A., Osaragi T.","DOI":"10.1007\/s40558-021-00208-3","x":5.93,"y":-3.35,"KeyPhrases":["tourist flow","random forest","residence information","spatiotemporal distribution","social data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"tourist flow","score":0.5042430162},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4315427542},{"key-phrase":"future tourism research","score":0.4208952487},{"key-phrase":"tourist","score":0.4170091152},{"key-phrase":"social data","score":0.3861501515},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3805063367},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3297657967},{"key-phrase":"dependent city","score":0.3258036971},{"key-phrase":"urban setting","score":0.3182204068},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.3158681989},{"key-phrase":"supervised-learning algorithms","score":0.3152838349},{"key-phrase":"residence information","score":0.2837688923},{"key-phrase":"randomized tree","score":0.28276366},{"key-phrase":"frequent visit","score":0.2822326422},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal distribution","score":0.2797111571},{"key-phrase":"popular hotspot","score":0.2709464431},{"key-phrase":"crowded place","score":0.2690910995},{"key-phrase":"Flickr user","score":0.2556507587},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.2519113421},{"key-phrase":"Temporal entropy","score":0.2155646533},{"key-phrase":"Shannon entropy","score":0.1934092343},{"key-phrase":"temporal distribution","score":0.1773689687},{"key-phrase":"linear model","score":0.1772211641},{"key-phrase":"photo","score":0.1753700674},{"key-phrase":"photo content","score":0.1703590155},{"key-phrase":"amusement venue","score":0.1588843465},{"key-phrase":"mobility pattern","score":0.1410520971},{"key-phrase":"hourly pattern","score":0.1341819018},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.1312377155},{"key-phrase":"different topic","score":0.1244989187},{"key-phrase":"special ward","score":0.0491706245},{"key-phrase":"previous study","score":0.0309059862}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":33,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The influence of urban visuospatial configuration on older adults\u2019 stress: A wearable physiological-perceived stress sensing and data mining based-approach","Abstract":"Population ageing raises many fundamental questions, including how the urban environment can be configured to promote active ageing. The perceived element for older adults' involvement in the environment differs from the average person. Despite this difference, there is little to no research into understanding how the perceived elements (specifically, the visuospatial configuration) of the environment influence older adults' involvement\u2014most studies focused on younger adults. The focus here is stress, which occurs when environmental demand exceeds a person's capability. As stress impacts a person's involvement in the environment and older adults are more likely to feel stress due to their decline in functional capability, it is important to understand how the visuospatial configuration of urban environment influence stress. Older adults were recruited to participate in an urban environment walk while their physiological responses (Photoplethysmogram) were monitored using wearable sensors. Their perceived stress responses were also collected. Spatial clustering and hot spot analysis were conducted to detect locations with clusters of physiological responses caused by spatial factors. These locations were subsequently labelled as stress or non-stress based on participants' perceived stress. The perceived visual elements of the urban environment were extracted using isovist analysis. Principal component analysis, self-organising map and machine learning algorithms were used to understand the relationship. The results demonstrate that isovist minimum visibility, occlusivity, and isovist area are the most influential determinants of older adults' physiological stress. Older adults prefer urban configurations where they can be seen. This study can be used to inform urban design and planning. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Isovist analysis; Machine learning; Older adult; Person-environment interaction; Physiological stress; Self-organising map","Authors":"Torku A., Chan A.P.C., Yung E.H.K., Seo J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.108298","x":5.0300002098,"y":2.4200000763,"KeyPhrases":["urban environment","active ageing","Principal component analysis","stress impacts","spatial factor"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.5406893492},{"key-phrase":"urban environment influence","score":0.5229068995},{"key-phrase":"urban design","score":0.4696455002},{"key-phrase":"active ageing","score":0.4511881173},{"key-phrase":"urban configuration","score":0.403896451},{"key-phrase":"physiological stress","score":0.401537329},{"key-phrase":"organising map","score":0.3683431745},{"key-phrase":"environment influence","score":0.3548107743},{"key-phrase":"Principal component analysis","score":0.3352016211},{"key-phrase":"Spatial clustering","score":0.3345331848},{"key-phrase":"stress impacts","score":0.3328344822},{"key-phrase":"stress response","score":0.310208261},{"key-phrase":"hot spot analysis","score":0.2792125344},{"key-phrase":"visuospatial configuration","score":0.2606936991},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.2581810653},{"key-phrase":"environmental demand","score":0.2580290437},{"key-phrase":"wearable sensor","score":0.2486914992},{"key-phrase":"spatial factor","score":0.2477776408},{"key-phrase":"physiological response","score":0.2308512032},{"key-phrase":"isovist analysis","score":0.2263379395},{"key-phrase":"ageing raise","score":0.2164155096},{"key-phrase":"isovist area","score":0.2124161869},{"key-phrase":"person's involvement","score":0.2005112022},{"key-phrase":"visual element","score":0.1988262534},{"key-phrase":"person's capability","score":0.1442016065},{"key-phrase":"isovist minimum visibility","score":0.141144529},{"key-phrase":"older","score":0.138654232},{"key-phrase":"average person","score":0.1361554265},{"key-phrase":"many fundamental question","score":0.1285457164},{"key-phrase":"adult","score":0.1169558465},{"key-phrase":"influential determinant","score":0.1028712243},{"key-phrase":"functional capability","score":0.1006010175}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":34,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Identifying urban built environment factors in pregnancy care and maternal mental health outcomes","Abstract":"Backgrounds: Risk factors related to the built environment have been associated with women\u2019s mental health and preventive care. This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients\u2019 residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients\u2019 residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Results: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. Conclusions: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD. Findings may inform urban design policies and provide awareness for care providers on the association of patients\u2019 residing neighborhoods and healthy pregnancy. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s).","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Postpartum depression; Pregnancy care","Authors":"Zhang Y., Tayarani M., Wang S., Liu Y., Sharma M., Joly R., RoyChoudhury A., Hermann A., Gao O.H., Pathak J.","DOI":"10.1186\/s12884-021-04056-1","x":6.6700000763,"y":4.1799998283,"KeyPhrases":["prenatal care","urban setting","Structural equation modeling","air pollutant concentration","mental health"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"prenatal care","score":0.4464672208},{"key-phrase":"prenatal care variation","score":0.4450988173},{"key-phrase":"prenatal care pattern","score":0.4158606827},{"key-phrase":"prenatal care event","score":0.3387211859},{"key-phrase":"healthy pregnancy","score":0.3291018605},{"key-phrase":"pregnant woman","score":0.3255294859},{"key-phrase":"urban setting","score":0.3134430349},{"key-phrase":"mental health","score":0.3065061271},{"key-phrase":"urban design policy","score":0.294519186},{"key-phrase":"prenatal","score":0.2929385304},{"key-phrase":"pregnancy outcome","score":0.2873038054},{"key-phrase":"environment factor","score":0.2842757404},{"key-phrase":"Structural equation modeling","score":0.2742019892},{"key-phrase":"preventive care","score":0.2568196654},{"key-phrase":"subsequent pregnancy","score":0.25288257},{"key-phrase":"Electronic health record","score":0.2506834269},{"key-phrase":"environment experience","score":0.2408011556},{"key-phrase":"retrospective observational study","score":0.2354376912},{"key-phrase":"care provider","score":0.2304223776},{"key-phrase":"clinical problem","score":0.2303222418},{"key-phrase":"multi-purpose and walkable community","score":0.2244669795},{"key-phrase":"retail floor ratio","score":0.2210200429},{"key-phrase":"air pollutant concentration","score":0.2191746533},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2178405076},{"key-phrase":"homogeneous land use","score":0.2097947896},{"key-phrase":"Risk factor","score":0.1977708936},{"key-phrase":"marital status","score":0.185784474},{"key-phrase":"academic medical center","score":0.1603807211},{"key-phrase":"clinical event","score":0.1593409479},{"key-phrase":"pattern detection","score":0.1550817043},{"key-phrase":"medication prescription","score":0.1453182101},{"key-phrase":"income inequality","score":0.1135156527},{"key-phrase":"adverse outcome","score":0.1090501323},{"key-phrase":"live delivery","score":0.1075166985},{"key-phrase":"average education level","score":0.092996344},{"key-phrase":"care","score":0.0758703202},{"key-phrase":"different pattern","score":0.0726688951},{"key-phrase":"main outcome","score":0.0350274034},{"key-phrase":"encounter type","score":0.0335838422},{"key-phrase":"common type","score":0.0230640694}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":35,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Mapping fine-scale visual quality distribution inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR data","Abstract":"The visual quality of urban streets is of vital importance for establishing a satisfying and comfortable experience for the residents in an urban community. It also has positive effects on urban vibrancy, public health, and social connections in that community. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the visual quality at the urban street level using street view images. However, the spatial distribution of fine-grained visual quality inside an urban street is rarely investigated. This study presents a new approach for the evaluation of visual quality inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR point clouds. The semantic information of urban streets was first extracted from mobile LiDAR point clouds with a Gradient Boosting classifier. After that, seven well-known key design elements, including the green space factor, sky view factor, enclosure rate, volume index, vehicle occurrence rate, motorization rate, and diversity, were calculated from the classified point clouds using a three-dimensional (3D) visibility model. Finally, the visual quality at 1 m grid resolution inside urban street was achieved automatically by using a random forest model which was trained based on perception samples. This approach has been validated on two study areas and the results indicated that the proposed approach is able to quantitatively examine the visual quality difference inside urban streets. The results generated by the proposed method also match well with the common sense of urban design experts, which are useful for architects and designers to develop best practices in the urban micro-renewal project and to refine the urban planning processes. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Fine-scale; Machine learning; Mobile LiDAR; Urban street; Visual quality","Authors":"Wu B., Yu B., Shu S., Liang H., Zhao Y., Wu J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.108323","x":7.57,"y":-4.87,"KeyPhrases":["street view image","classified point cloud","visual quality difference","urban micro-renewal project","green space factor"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"street view image","score":0.4906252623},{"key-phrase":"urban street level","score":0.4782166183},{"key-phrase":"classified point cloud","score":0.4364763498},{"key-phrase":"urban design expert","score":0.4302047789},{"key-phrase":"visual quality","score":0.4246864915},{"key-phrase":"mobile LiDAR point","score":0.3987564445},{"key-phrase":"urban micro-renewal project","score":0.3916789889},{"key-phrase":"visual quality difference","score":0.3665476441},{"key-phrase":"urban planning process","score":0.3617720604},{"key-phrase":"urban vibrancy","score":0.3604621291},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained visual quality","score":0.3541390598},{"key-phrase":"urban street","score":0.3387616277},{"key-phrase":"random forest model","score":0.3000210524},{"key-phrase":"perception sample","score":0.2982171774},{"key-phrase":"urban community","score":0.2920356393},{"key-phrase":"street","score":0.2859458923},{"key-phrase":"visibility model","score":0.2651698589},{"key-phrase":"green space factor","score":0.2465264797},{"key-phrase":"sky view factor","score":0.2394189686},{"key-phrase":"semantic information","score":0.2157348096},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.1969442368},{"key-phrase":"vehicle occurrence rate","score":0.1677910686},{"key-phrase":"volume index","score":0.1584653556},{"key-phrase":"m grid resolution","score":0.149921298},{"key-phrase":"satisfying and comfortable experience","score":0.1458788961},{"key-phrase":"common sense","score":0.1370108724},{"key-phrase":"key design element","score":0.1131104901},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1119785756},{"key-phrase":"enclosure rate","score":0.0866039917},{"key-phrase":"public health","score":0.0831222236},{"key-phrase":"social connection","score":0.0742084906},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0697372109},{"key-phrase":"motorization rate","score":0.0543791354},{"key-phrase":"positive effect","score":0.03554805},{"key-phrase":"new approach","score":0.0304943621},{"key-phrase":"inside","score":0.024544701},{"key-phrase":"vital importance","score":0.0149390083},{"key-phrase":"Numerous study","score":-0.0019443296}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":36,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation and Prediction from Socioeconomic Variables Using Automatic Feature Selection Procedure-Based Machine Learning Model","Abstract":"The origin-destination (OD) demand matrix plays an essential role in travel modeling and transport planning.

The M\u00e1laga region, Spain, was used as a case study. The proposed methodology involves two stages. First, an automatic feature selection procedure was developed to determine the most relevant socioeconomic variables, discarding the irrelevant ones. Several feature selection techniques were studied and combined. Second, machine learning (ML) models were used to estimate mobility between predefined zones. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR) were tested and compared using the most relevant variables as inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed combined model can be more accurate than traditional methods and ML models without the feature selection procedure. In particular, SVR with feature selection slightly outperformed the combined model using ANNs. The proposed methodology can be a promising and affordable alternative method for estimating OD matrices, reducing costs and lead time significantly, and assisting and improving urban transport planning. \u00a9 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural networks; Feature selection; Machine learning; Origin-destination (OD) matrix; Support vector machines; Urban transport planning","Authors":"Rodr\u00edguez-Rueda P.J., Ruiz-Aguilar J.J., Gonz\u00e1lez-Enrique J., Turias I.","DOI":"10.1061\/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000763","x":4.9000000954,"y":1.8799999952,"KeyPhrases":["urban transport planning","support vector regression","relevant socioeconomic variable","demand matrix","expensive and laborious traffic count"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban transport planning","score":0.534701407},{"key-phrase":"urban mobility","score":0.4967848659},{"key-phrase":"transport planning","score":0.4703450203},{"key-phrase":"support vector regression","score":0.4680777788},{"key-phrase":"feature selection","score":0.4292452037},{"key-phrase":"automatic feature selection","score":0.4174614549},{"key-phrase":"travel modeling","score":0.4060060978},{"key-phrase":"Several feature selection","score":0.3993083835},{"key-phrase":"feature selection procedure","score":0.3923212588},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3623204827},{"key-phrase":"expensive and laborious traffic count","score":0.3616672456},{"key-phrase":"ML model","score":0.3343859911},{"key-phrase":"demand matrix","score":0.2806324363},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic variable","score":0.2733105421},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.2730920911},{"key-phrase":"relevant socioeconomic variable","score":0.216924578},{"key-phrase":"relevant variable","score":0.2131820917},{"key-phrase":"M\u00e1laga region","score":0.1836459935},{"key-phrase":"new combined methodology","score":0.1816346049},{"key-phrase":"predefined zone","score":0.1239743605},{"key-phrase":"matrix","score":0.1079606712},{"key-phrase":"affordable alternative method","score":0.0933425426},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.086639829},{"key-phrase":"OD matrix","score":0.0861648172},{"key-phrase":"Traditional OD matrix","score":0.0812693909},{"key-phrase":"irrelevant one","score":0.0638501793},{"key-phrase":"traditional method","score":0.0472972654},{"key-phrase":"essential role","score":0.0120996479},{"key-phrase":"OD","score":0.0082912473},{"key-phrase":"experimental result","score":-0.023242753},{"key-phrase":"lead time","score":-0.040494442}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":37,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"GAN-Based Semisupervised Scene Classification of Remote Sensing Image","Abstract":"With the advent of a large number of remote sensing images (RSIs), scene classification of RSI is widely applied to many fields such as urban planning, natural disaster detection, and environmental monitoring. Compared with the natural image field, the lack of labeled RSI is a bottleneck of supervised scene classification methods based on deep learning. Meanwhile, unsupervised scene classification is difficult to meet actual needs. To this end, we propose a novel semisupervised scene classification method for RSI using generative adversarial nets (GANs), in which a gating unit, a self-attention gating (SAG) module, and a pretrained Inception V3 branch are introduced into discriminative network to enhance the feature representation capability for facilitating semisupervised classification. To be specific, the gating unit aims to learn the weights of each feature map and capture the dependence relationship between features. The SAG module aims to capture a long-range dependence for adaptively focusing on important scene regions. The Inception V3 branch aims to extract the high-level semantic representation of input images and further enhance the discriminant ability by gating unit and SAG module. Furthermore, a new optimization term is incorporated into the generator loss to indirectly drive discriminator to correctly classify scene images. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experimental results on UC Merced and EuroSAT data sets demonstrate that the method surpasses most of the state-of-the-art semisupervised image classification methods significantly, especially when only few samples are tagged. \u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Gating unit; generative adversarial nets (GANs); remote sensing image (RSI); self-attention gating (SAG) module; semisupervised image classification","Authors":"Guo D., Xia Y., Luo X.","DOI":"10.1109\/LGRS.2020.3014108","x":9.64,"y":-5.71,"KeyPhrases":["novel semisupervised scene classification","generator loss","generative adversarial net","high-level semantic representation","natural disaster detection"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"novel semisupervised scene classification","score":0.5029142499},{"key-phrase":"discriminative network","score":0.4793450534},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised scene classification","score":0.4772456884},{"key-phrase":"generative adversarial net","score":0.4614864886},{"key-phrase":"scene classification","score":0.4382920265},{"key-phrase":"pretrained Inception V3","score":0.4311631918},{"key-phrase":"natural disaster detection","score":0.4090023637},{"key-phrase":"supervised scene classification","score":0.3969522119},{"key-phrase":"image classification method","score":0.375447154},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.3727882504},{"key-phrase":"high-level semantic representation","score":0.3365014791},{"key-phrase":"natural image field","score":0.3103084564},{"key-phrase":"important scene region","score":0.301881671},{"key-phrase":"Inception V3 branch","score":0.2791865766},{"key-phrase":"feature map","score":0.2378083766},{"key-phrase":"discriminant ability","score":0.2367107272},{"key-phrase":"feature representation capability","score":0.2289284468},{"key-phrase":"scene image","score":0.215248391},{"key-phrase":"generator loss","score":0.1901060939},{"key-phrase":"input image","score":0.1822526157},{"key-phrase":"gating unit","score":0.1779495776},{"key-phrase":"attention gating","score":0.1683859676},{"key-phrase":"many field","score":0.1659427285},{"key-phrase":"environmental monitoring","score":0.1642615497},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.1618861258},{"key-phrase":"long-range dependence","score":0.152929008},{"key-phrase":"gating","score":0.1267077625},{"key-phrase":"RSI","score":0.1140809655},{"key-phrase":"SAG module","score":0.1099291444},{"key-phrase":"SAG module aim","score":0.0902080238},{"key-phrase":"few sample","score":0.0834667608},{"key-phrase":"large number","score":0.0786707699},{"key-phrase":"new optimization term","score":0.0718861073},{"key-phrase":"UC Merced","score":0.0616074875},{"key-phrase":"dependence relationship","score":0.0614670143},{"key-phrase":"actual need","score":0.0246915631},{"key-phrase":"EuroSAT data","score":0.0212335568},{"key-phrase":"extensive experimental result","score":0.0168278944},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":-0.0127371177}]},{"Cluster":3,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":38,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A Support Vector Machine Implementation for Traffic Assignment Problem","Abstract":"Simulating urban mobility scenarios is a useful tool for researchers in multiple fields like Urban Planning, Traffic Optimization, CO$^2$ Emissions Analysis, Performance Evaluation of Protocols for Connected Vehicles, among others.

It can be used by planners and decision-makers to identify clusters of high energy demand in a given urban area and efficiently plan, for example, district heating networks. Various data sources exist at the pan-European level describing land use and built areas. Combined with statistical data, such maps have been used in previous research for estimating building energy performance aggregated at the hectare level, using engineering assumptions. In this paper, we show that large-scale land-use maps alone can be used for predicting annual building energy demand with an accuracy comparable to the one of previous engineering models. We hence present a preliminary method based on Convolutional Neural Networks at different spatial resolutions. The resulting model was trained and tested in an area of about 170 km2 in Geneva (Switzerland) using a local annual heating demand dataset comprising 16239 buildings. On a 300-m aggregation tile, the obtained mean error (14.3%) is significantly reduced compared to the one of a simple linear model (37.2%). Using solely land-use data, we also achieve similar results for a 100-m tile as those of an engineering model from the literature. \u00a9 Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licence.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Peronato G., Boghetti R., K\u00e4mpf J.H.","DOI":"10.1088\/1742-6596\/2042\/1\/012019","x":4.1399998665,"y":4.5399999619,"KeyPhrases":["urban energy planning","Convolutional Neural Networks","large-scale land","m aggregation tile","simple linear model"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban energy planning","score":0.5562181473},{"key-phrase":"annual building energy","score":0.5121406317},{"key-phrase":"building energy demand","score":0.5024667978},{"key-phrase":"local annual heating demand","score":0.4873266816},{"key-phrase":"building energy performance","score":0.3914153278},{"key-phrase":"district heating network","score":0.3796555698},{"key-phrase":"Convolutional Neural Networks","score":0.355127126},{"key-phrase":"high energy demand","score":0.3532888293},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3464132249},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.3081858754},{"key-phrase":"large-scale land","score":0.2740766108},{"key-phrase":"use map","score":0.2575502694},{"key-phrase":"use data","score":0.2260784656},{"key-phrase":"hectare level","score":0.2013061643},{"key-phrase":"simple linear model","score":0.1999416798},{"key-phrase":"m aggregation tile","score":0.1923664212},{"key-phrase":"statistical data","score":0.1872333884},{"key-phrase":"engineering model","score":0.1837762594},{"key-phrase":"energy","score":0.1710713953},{"key-phrase":"previous engineering model","score":0.1627219617},{"key-phrase":"engineering","score":0.1601481736},{"key-phrase":"pan-European level","score":0.1499686539},{"key-phrase":"such map","score":0.1453805864},{"key-phrase":"engineering assumption","score":0.1433100849},{"key-phrase":"Various data source","score":0.1300538182},{"key-phrase":"mean error","score":0.1165124923},{"key-phrase":"different spatial resolution","score":0.1030592546},{"key-phrase":"m tile","score":0.0818044841},{"key-phrase":"useful indicator","score":0.0690298602},{"key-phrase":"similar result","score":0.0573213473},{"key-phrase":"previous research","score":0.0348617211},{"key-phrase":"preliminary method","score":-0.0027477983}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":41,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"National Empirical Models of Air Pollution Using Microscale Measures of the Urban Environment","Abstract":"National-scale empirical models of air pollution (e.g., Land Use Regression) rely on predictor variables (e.g., population density, land cover) at different geographic scales. These models typically lack microscale variables (e.g., street level), which may improve prediction with fine-spatial gradients. We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K). We compared predictor variables (e.g., traditional vs microscale) and emerging modeling approaches (ML-K) to well-established approaches (i.e., traditional variables in a PLS-K or SW-K framework). We found that combined predictor variables (traditional + microscale) in the ML-K models outperformed the well-established approaches (10-fold spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 increased 0.02-0.42 [average: 0.19] among six criteria pollutants). Comparing all model types using microscale variables to models with traditional variables, the performance is similar (average difference of 10-fold spatial CV R2 = 0.05) suggesting microscale variables are a suitable substitute for traditional variables. ML-K and microscale variables show promise for improving national empirical models. \u00a9 2021 American Chemical Society.","Author Keywords":"Empirical models; exposure assessment; machine learning; street-level features; urban form","Authors":"Lu T., Marshall J.D., Zhang W., Hystad P., Kim S.-Y., Bechle M.J., Demuzere M., Hankey S.","DOI":"10.1021\/acs.est.1c04047","x":-5.7300000191,"y":7.8400001526,"KeyPhrases":["Land Use Regression","criterion pollutant","spatial cross-validation","microscale variable","urban environment"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Land Use Regression","score":0.6043577194},{"key-phrase":"air pollution","score":0.4287407398},{"key-phrase":"spatial cross-validation","score":0.4244222343},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.422426641},{"key-phrase":"National-scale empirical model","score":0.3695372641},{"key-phrase":"criterion pollutant","score":0.3582046628},{"key-phrase":"Stepwise Regression","score":0.3454800844},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.3318412602},{"key-phrase":"urban form","score":0.3177614212},{"key-phrase":"different geographic scale","score":0.3112459183},{"key-phrase":"national empirical model","score":0.3062411547},{"key-phrase":"predictor variable","score":0.3028280437},{"key-phrase":"various modeling approach","score":0.2678994834},{"key-phrase":"population density","score":0.2632208169},{"key-phrase":"Machine Learning","score":0.2576605678},{"key-phrase":"microscale variable","score":0.2472379804},{"key-phrase":"K model","score":0.2447261214},{"key-phrase":"spatial CV R2","score":0.2295446992},{"key-phrase":"Google Street View","score":0.2280456722},{"key-phrase":"modeling approach","score":0.2273277491},{"key-phrase":"national model","score":0.1957165599},{"key-phrase":"fine-spatial gradient","score":0.1859238446},{"key-phrase":"model type","score":0.1733963042},{"key-phrase":"microscale","score":0.16644077},{"key-phrase":"street level","score":0.159872219},{"key-phrase":"K framework","score":0.1467505693},{"key-phrase":"K","score":0.0946328491},{"key-phrase":"suitable substitute","score":0.0695513412},{"key-phrase":"United States","score":0.0368776582},{"key-phrase":"average difference","score":0.0195201784},{"key-phrase":"variable show promise","score":0.0119945537}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":42,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"SPATIAL CLASSIFICATION of URBAN LAND by SPECULATIVE LAND VALUE and MSI SATELLITE IMAGERY USING K-MEANS, in HUANCAYO, PERU [CLASIFICACI\u00d3N ESPACIAL DEL SUELO URBANO POR EL VALOR ESPECULATIVO DEL SUELO E IM\u00c1GENES MSI SATELITALES USANDO K-MEANS, HUANCAYO, PER\u00da]","Abstract":"The city of Huancayo, like other intermediate cities in Latin America, faces problems of poorly planned land-use changes and a rapid dynamic of the urban land market.

The purpose of this research was the adoption of unassisted and mixed methods for the spatial classification of urban areas, considering the speculative land value, the proportion of urbanized land, and other geospatial variables. Among the data collection media, Multi-Spectral Imagery (MSI) from the Sentinel-2 satellite, the primary road system, and a sample of direct observation points, were used. The processed data were incorporated into georeferenced maps, to which urban limits and official slopes were added. During data processing, the K-Means algorithm was used, together with other machine learning and assisted judgment methods. As a result, an objective classification of urban areas was obtained, which differs from the existing planning. \u00a9 2021 The authors.

This study proposes a novel end-to-end POI conflation framework consisting of six steps, starting with data procurement, schema standardisation, taxonomy mapping, POI matching, POI unification, and data verification. The feasibility of the proposed framework was demonstrated in a case study conducted in the eastern region of Singapore, where the POI data from five data sources was conflated to form a unified POI dataset. Based on the evaluation conducted, the resulting unified dataset was found to be more comprehensive and complete than any of the five POI data sources alone. Furthermore, the proposed approach for identifying POI matches between different data sources outperformed all baseline approaches with a matching accuracy of 97.6% with an average run time below 3 min when matching over 12,000 POIs to result in 8699 unique POIs, thereby demonstrating the framework\u2019s scalability for large scale implementation in dense urban contexts. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Over the past 20 years, the city of Dallas, Texas, has consistently been one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and has faced rapid urbanization and great amounts of urban sprawl, leading to an increase in built-up surface area. In this study, we utilize Landsat 8 satellite images, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, land use\/land cover (LULC) data, and a state-of-the-art methodology combining machine learning algorithms (eX-treme Gradient Boosted models, or XGBoost) and a modern game theoretic-based approach (Shap-ley Additive exPlanation, or SHAP values) to investigate how different land use\/land cover classi-fications impact the land surface temperature and park cooling effects in the city of Dallas. We con-clude that green spaces, residential, and commercial\/office spaces have the largest impacts on Land Surface Temperatures (LST) as well as the Park\u2019s Cooling Intensity (PCI). Additionally, we have found that the extent and direction of influence of these categories depends heavily on the surrounding area. By using SHAP values we can describe these interactions in greater detail than pre-vious studies. These results will provide an important reference for future urban and park place-ment planning to minimize the urban heat island effect, especially in sprawling cities. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning technologies have contributed to the mapping and monitoring of multi-scale urban land uses, yet there lacks a holistic mapping framework that is compatible with different end users\u2019 demands. Moreover, land use mix has evolved to be a key component in modern urban settings, but few have explicitly measured the spatial complexity of land use or quantitively uncovered its driving forces. Addressing these challenges, here we developed a novel two-stage bottom-up scheme for mapping essential urban land use categories. In the first stage, we conducted object-based land use classification using crowdsourcing features derived from multi-source open big data and an automated ensemble learning approach. In the second stage, we identified parcel-based land use attributes, including the dominant type and mixture mode, by spatially correlating land parcels with the object-based results. Furthermore, we investigated the potential influencing factors of land use mix using principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. Experimental results in Ningbo, a coastal city in China, showed that the proposed framework could accurately depict the distribution and composition of urban land uses. At the object scale, the highest classification accuracy was as high as 86% and 78% for the major (Level I) and minor (Level II) categories, respectively. At the parcel scale, the generated land use maps were spatially consistent with the object-based maps. We found larger parcels were more likely to be mixed in land use, and industrial lands were characterized as the most complicated category. We also identified multiple factors that had a collective impact on land use mix, including geography, socioeconomy, accessibility, and landscape metrics. Altogether, our proposed framework offered an alternative to investigating urban land use composition, which could be applied in a broad range of implications in future urban studies. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

In particular, a multi-source, deep learning-based object detection pipeline was developed. This pipeline introduces three new features: First, strategies of both data-level fusion (i.e., channel expansion on convolutional neural networks) and feature-level fusion were integrated into the object detection model to allow simultaneous machine learning from multi-source data, including remote sensing imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. Second, a new data fusion strategy was developed to blend DEM data and its derivatives to create a new, fused data source with enriched information content and image features. The model has also enabled deep learning by combining both the proposed data fusion and feature-level fusion strategies to yield a much-improved detection result. Third, two different sets of data augmentation techniques were applied to the multi-source training data to further improve the model performance. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in multi-source deep learning. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Data enrichment; Deep Learning; GeoAI; Multi-source data fusion; Object detection","Authors":"Wang S., Li W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101715","x":9.48,"y":-5.78,"KeyPhrases":["multi-source deep learning","new GeoAI research","natural feature detection","data augmentation technique","multi-source geospatial data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"multi-source deep learning","score":0.4970421791},{"key-phrase":"new data fusion","score":0.4494649768},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.4386113882},{"key-phrase":"multi-source geospatial data","score":0.4336673021},{"key-phrase":"natural feature detection","score":0.42005831},{"key-phrase":"data fusion","score":0.4098479152},{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.3998128176},{"key-phrase":"new GeoAI research","score":0.3956398666},{"key-phrase":"deep machine learning","score":0.3898503482},{"key-phrase":"multi-source training data","score":0.3795232475},{"key-phrase":"object detection model","score":0.341586113},{"key-phrase":"object detection pipeline","score":0.3338264823},{"key-phrase":"multi-source data","score":0.3324803114},{"key-phrase":"blend DEM data","score":0.3290064931},{"key-phrase":"simultaneous machine learning","score":0.3237985969},{"key-phrase":"image feature","score":0.3185581267},{"key-phrase":"data augmentation technique","score":0.3142053485},{"key-phrase":"level fusion","score":0.2904452085},{"key-phrase":"much-improved detection","score":0.2687596381},{"key-phrase":"Digital Elevation Model","score":0.2493040413},{"key-phrase":"level fusion strategy","score":0.2266912311},{"key-phrase":"fusion","score":0.219990328},{"key-phrase":"data source","score":0.2132196724},{"key-phrase":"new feature","score":0.212918967},{"key-phrase":"enriched information content","score":0.2047366798},{"key-phrase":"channel expansion","score":0.1585759223},{"key-phrase":"pipeline","score":0.1321556568},{"key-phrase":"model performance","score":0.082836464},{"key-phrase":"different set","score":0.0293562729}]},{"Cluster":30,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":47,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Prediction of crime rate in urban neighborhoods based on machine learning","Abstract":"As the impact of crime on the lives of residents has increased, there are a number of methods for predicting where crime will occur. They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan. In addition the ideas in this paper can be applied as a set of methodologies to predict other relevant urban characteristic parameters and visualize them. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Big data analysis; Crime rate; Machine learning; Urban design","Authors":"He J., Zheng H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.engappai.2021.104460","x":4.6500000954,"y":3.9700000286,"KeyPhrases":["crime distribution map","neural network","city floor plan","security planning","untrained Philadelphia data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"crime distribution map","score":0.5902793407},{"key-phrase":"crime hotspot distribution","score":0.5562592745},{"key-phrase":"crime concentration area","score":0.5237580538},{"key-phrase":"crime rate","score":0.4795014262},{"key-phrase":"crime distribution","score":0.4444853365},{"key-phrase":"city layout","score":0.4171944261},{"key-phrase":"city floor plan","score":0.4101239443},{"key-phrase":"city plan","score":0.3910400569},{"key-phrase":"crime information","score":0.3833138049},{"key-phrase":"simulated city planner","score":0.3751495183},{"key-phrase":"urban characteristic parameter","score":0.3681334257},{"key-phrase":"crime","score":0.3456484079},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.3353495002},{"key-phrase":"prediction model","score":0.3163606524},{"key-phrase":"floor plan","score":0.2968540788},{"key-phrase":"untrained Philadelphia data","score":0.2925775945},{"key-phrase":"training set","score":0.2923822701},{"key-phrase":"security planning","score":0.287971437},{"key-phrase":"hotspot map","score":0.283426404},{"key-phrase":"concentration area","score":0.2478614151},{"key-phrase":"different neighborhood","score":0.2286818475},{"key-phrase":"philadelphia","score":0.1836492419},{"key-phrase":"research sample","score":0.1260160804},{"key-phrase":"previous study","score":0.0468428805},{"key-phrase":"single factor","score":-0.0061360374}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":48,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Assessing bikeability with street view imagery and computer vision","Abstract":"Studies evaluating bikeability usually compute spatial indicators shaping cycling conditions and conflate them in a quantitative index. Much research involves site visits or conventional geospatial approaches, and few studies have leveraged street view imagery (SVI) for conducting virtual audits. These have assessed a limited range of aspects, and not all have been automated using computer vision (CV). Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability and potentially can be used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining both SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a contribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to assess cycling appeal widely. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Bicycles; Deep learning; GIS; Google Street View; OpenStreetMap; Urban planning","Authors":"Ito K., Biljecki F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.trc.2021.103371","x":7.49,"y":-4.53,"KeyPhrases":["new bikeability index","street view imagery","spatial indicator","urban analytics","non-SVI approach"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"new bikeability index","score":0.7071278095},{"key-phrase":"urban bikeability","score":0.6837587357},{"key-phrase":"bikeability","score":0.5883358717},{"key-phrase":"street view imagery","score":0.498434186},{"key-phrase":"urban analytics","score":0.4961418808},{"key-phrase":"cycling appeal","score":0.4475603998},{"key-phrase":"spatial indicator","score":0.369286865},{"key-phrase":"conventional geospatial approach","score":0.323299855},{"key-phrase":"computer vision","score":0.3074659705},{"key-phrase":"multiple geography","score":0.2330635786},{"key-phrase":"cycling condition","score":0.2328731865},{"key-phrase":"fine spatial scale","score":0.2257528156},{"key-phrase":"quantitative index","score":0.2247262746},{"key-phrase":"SVI indicator","score":0.206027776},{"key-phrase":"site visit","score":0.1945884079},{"key-phrase":"exhaustive index","score":0.174442187},{"key-phrase":"SVI","score":0.1596707404},{"key-phrase":"non-SVI approach","score":0.1430848688},{"key-phrase":"virtual audits","score":0.112150833},{"key-phrase":"non-SVI counterpart","score":0.1108309031},{"key-phrase":"wide margin","score":0.0855816677},{"key-phrase":"Much research","score":0.0582566783},{"key-phrase":"related work","score":0.0537039302},{"key-phrase":"limited range","score":0.0130237425},{"key-phrase":"few study","score":0.0092034992},{"key-phrase":"traditional technique","score":-0.0434265584}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":49,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Modeling pedestrian emotion in high-density cities using visual exposure and machine learning: Tracking real-time physiology and psychology in Hong Kong","Abstract":"People's mental health has been deteriorating as a result of urban living, which also causes disability, pain, or even death among metropolitan residents. Understanding the interaction between human emotions and the built environment is therefore essential for developing strategies towards a psychologically friendly and socially resilient environment. This study aims to model the pedestrian emotion in high-density urban areas of Hong Kong using machine learning based on environmental visual exposure, which is one of the most significant factors affecting emotions. Using ambulatory sensing and portable technologies, two-dimensional emotional data from 99 pedestrians are retrieved from coupled data with respect to wearable arousal, subjective report preference, and the location at a high spatiotemporal resolution (4 m). The visual environment is quantified by isovist and street view factors. This study examines the impact of visual exposures using two multiple linear regression (MLR) models and establishes a predictive model using random forest (RF) (N = 548). The MLR models have R2 values around 0.5 and suggest that in the high-density environment, exposure to more trees, visual volume, and drift magnitude can cause positive emotions. Conversely, areas with a view of sign symbols, object proportion, min-radial, and occlusivity can cause negative emotions. The resultant predictive model with nine visual exposure variables can explain 79% of the spatial variance of pedestrian emotion. Furthermore, the methodological framework provides opportunities for spatial, data-driven approaches to portable sensing and urban planning research. The findings are also applicable to optimize the infrastructure design of outdoor environments for more psychologically friendly experiences. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Ambulatory pedestrian emotion track; Deep learning; Environment perception; Isovist; Random forest; Street view","Authors":"Xiang L., Cai M., Ren C., Ng E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.108273","x":6.84,"y":-4.45,"KeyPhrases":["pedestrian emotion","random forest","high-density urban area","environmental visual exposure","dimensional emotional data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"pedestrian emotion","score":0.6156798601},{"key-phrase":"dimensional emotional data","score":0.5271119475},{"key-phrase":"human emotion","score":0.4807328284},{"key-phrase":"urban living","score":0.4403786063},{"key-phrase":"wearable arousal","score":0.4314283729},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.426468879},{"key-phrase":"emotion","score":0.4172897339},{"key-phrase":"negative emotion","score":0.4129635692},{"key-phrase":"urban planning research","score":0.4088855386},{"key-phrase":"environmental visual exposure","score":0.3934560418},{"key-phrase":"positive emotion","score":0.3915489912},{"key-phrase":"high-density urban area","score":0.3765560389},{"key-phrase":"outdoor environment","score":0.3653302789},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3501171172},{"key-phrase":"visual environment","score":0.3494287133},{"key-phrase":"friendly experience","score":0.3245175481},{"key-phrase":"multiple linear regression","score":0.3221398294},{"key-phrase":"predictive model","score":0.3120290637},{"key-phrase":"street view factor","score":0.3063194156},{"key-phrase":"visual exposure variable","score":0.3012689352},{"key-phrase":"visual exposure","score":0.280936867},{"key-phrase":"resilient environment","score":0.2724266648},{"key-phrase":"spatial variance","score":0.2650107145},{"key-phrase":"MLR model","score":0.2615971565},{"key-phrase":"visual volume","score":0.2430404127},{"key-phrase":"mental health","score":0.2396697998},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan resident","score":0.2294001728},{"key-phrase":"subjective report preference","score":0.2141059488},{"key-phrase":"exposure","score":0.187110126},{"key-phrase":"infrastructure design","score":0.1829401255},{"key-phrase":"Hong Kong","score":0.1744285226},{"key-phrase":"R2 value","score":0.1663736701},{"key-phrase":"high-density environment","score":0.152205348},{"key-phrase":"resultant predictive model","score":0.150584355},{"key-phrase":"methodological framework","score":0.1471738666},{"key-phrase":"portable technology","score":0.1322610378},{"key-phrase":"high spatiotemporal resolution","score":0.1277524084},{"key-phrase":"object proportion","score":0.1026192307},{"key-phrase":"significant factor","score":0.0950858071},{"key-phrase":"sign symbol","score":0.0919581428},{"key-phrase":"drift magnitude","score":0.0756276697}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":50,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Nonlinear relationship between urban form and street-level PM2.5 and CO based on mobile measurements and gradient boosting decision tree models","Abstract":"Exposure to PM2.5 and CO has been proven to be closely related to physical health. Since 2012, they have been added to the pollutant list for national monitoring in Wuhan. However, the fine-scale variation in pollution, especially at the street level, is complex and requires further exploration. In this study, the influence of urban form on the street-level air pollution distribution was comprehensively assessed according to the urban factors, high-resolution meteorological data, PM2.5 and CO concentration data collected via mobile monitoring along roads in Wuhan. Furthermore, potential urban factors, including the land-use and urban form characteristics, were obtained from geographic information system. Both linear regression and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models were developed to explore the relationship between the observed concentrations and the predictor variables. The modeling results demonstrate that the GBDT model, which captured the non-linear relationship, helps to better explain more of the variations in the pollutant concentrations than the linear model. This study provides insights into machine learning models for pollution prediction and demonstrate the important relationship between urban form and street-level pollutants. The results suggest that the urban form of the podium-level porosity can be set higher than 0.7 to promote the ventilation of street-level PM2.5 and CO, building density can be less than 0.35, and the standard deviation of height can be set to ~10 m in central Wuhan to mitigate street-level PM2.5. Thus, quantitatively demonstrating the impact of urban form on the PM2.5 and CO concentrations can help decision-makers with urban planning and management. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); Machine learning; Street-level air pollution; Urban form","Authors":"Liu M., Chen H., Wei D., Wu Y., Li C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.108265","x":-5.5,"y":7.8699998856,"KeyPhrases":["pollution prediction","central Wuhan","decision tree","urban planning","level PM2"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"pollution prediction","score":0.6263301373},{"key-phrase":"level air pollution","score":0.4657362103},{"key-phrase":"pollutant concentration","score":0.4049975276},{"key-phrase":"potential urban factor","score":0.4037392437},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3851087689},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.370285064},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3536292613},{"key-phrase":"urban form","score":0.3299194574},{"key-phrase":"pollutant list","score":0.324547112},{"key-phrase":"urban factor","score":0.3216376007},{"key-phrase":"central Wuhan","score":0.3110132515},{"key-phrase":"level pollutant","score":0.3005164862},{"key-phrase":"wuhan","score":0.2950966358},{"key-phrase":"geographic information system","score":0.2600564957},{"key-phrase":"CO concentration data","score":0.250849843},{"key-phrase":"predictor variable","score":0.2304887772},{"key-phrase":"linear regression","score":0.2249851972},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution meteorological data","score":0.2164533138},{"key-phrase":"level PM2","score":0.2080866694},{"key-phrase":"linear model","score":0.1955381632},{"key-phrase":"modeling result","score":0.1933466792},{"key-phrase":"street level","score":0.1829586923},{"key-phrase":"CO concentration","score":0.1805353761},{"key-phrase":"GBDT model","score":0.146776855},{"key-phrase":"standard deviation","score":0.120454967},{"key-phrase":"non-linear relationship","score":0.1192162931},{"key-phrase":"level porosity","score":0.096516341},{"key-phrase":"mobile monitoring","score":0.0704168081},{"key-phrase":"important relationship","score":0.0627359152},{"key-phrase":"physical health","score":0.0499591753},{"key-phrase":"CO","score":0.0452734157},{"key-phrase":"fine-scale variation","score":0.0344017372},{"key-phrase":"national monitoring","score":0.0303503443},{"key-phrase":"further exploration","score":-0.0407376885}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":51,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Street view imagery in urban analytics and GIS: A review","Abstract":"Street view imagery has rapidly ascended as an important data source for geospatial data collection and urban analytics, deriving insights and supporting informed decisions.

A notable trend is crowdsourced street view imagery, facilitated by services such as Mapillary and KartaView, in some cases furthering geographical coverage and temporal granularity, at a permissive licence. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Deep learning; Ground-level; Remote sensing; Urban data science; Urban planning","Authors":"Biljecki F., Ito K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2021.104217","x":7.83,"y":-4.72,"KeyPhrases":["Street view imagery","urban analytics","comprehensive systematic review","entrenched component","machine learning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Street view imagery","score":0.7242443562},{"key-phrase":"Google Street View","score":0.6774245501},{"key-phrase":"urban analytics","score":0.5660783648},{"key-phrase":"geospatial data collection","score":0.5301412344},{"key-phrase":"large-scale imagery","score":0.4536552727},{"key-phrase":"street","score":0.3688516617},{"key-phrase":"geographical coverage","score":0.355846256},{"key-phrase":"imagery","score":0.3527971208},{"key-phrase":"computer vision","score":0.3295273185},{"key-phrase":"level imagery","score":0.3249920011},{"key-phrase":"important data source","score":0.28960675},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2838516533},{"key-phrase":"economic study","score":0.1545133889},{"key-phrase":"informed decision","score":0.1364401281},{"key-phrase":"temporal granularity","score":0.1265590787},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive systematic review","score":0.1164883226},{"key-phrase":"notable trend","score":0.0940208137},{"key-phrase":"numerous application","score":0.0920887366},{"key-phrase":"Such surge","score":0.0916437954},{"key-phrase":"permissive licence","score":0.0591561422},{"key-phrase":"main finding","score":0.0574926808},{"key-phrase":"recent paper","score":0.0357166901},{"key-phrase":"entrenched component","score":-0.029904671}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":52,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Places for play: Understanding human perception of playability in cities using street view images and deep learning","Abstract":"Play benefits childhood development and well-being, and is a key factor in sustainable city design. Though previous studies have examined the effects of various urban features on how much children play and where they play, such studies rely on quantitative measurements of play such as the precise location of play and the duration of play time, while people's subjective feelings regarding the playability of their environment are overlooked. In this study, we capture people's perception of place playability by employing Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to classify street view images. A deep learning model trained on the labelled data is then used to evaluate neighborhood playability for three U.S. cities: Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco. Finally, multivariate and geographically weighted regression models are used to explore how various urban features are associated with playability. We find that higher traffic speeds and crime rates are negatively associated with playability, while higher scores for perception of beauty are positively associated with playability. Interestingly, a place that is perceived as lively may not be playable. Our research provides helpful insights for urban planning focused on sustainable city growth and development, as well as for research focused on creating nourishing environments for child development. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Deep learning; Human perception of place; Playability; Street view images","Authors":"Kruse J., Kang Y., Liu Y.-N., Zhang F., Gao S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101693","x":7.0,"y":-4.58,"KeyPhrases":["neighborhood playability","deep learning model","sustainable city design","people's perception","crime rate"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"neighborhood playability","score":0.6290980577},{"key-phrase":"place playability","score":0.5997231603},{"key-phrase":"various urban feature","score":0.4501607418},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4352161586},{"key-phrase":"sustainable city design","score":0.421669066},{"key-phrase":"benefit childhood development","score":0.3951284289},{"key-phrase":"much child play","score":0.3760047555},{"key-phrase":"sustainable city growth","score":0.3717923164},{"key-phrase":"child development","score":0.3581059575},{"key-phrase":"playability","score":0.3577133119},{"key-phrase":"play","score":0.3575857878},{"key-phrase":"crime rate","score":0.3318985701},{"key-phrase":"Amazon Mechanical Turk","score":0.3160535097},{"key-phrase":"play time","score":0.311591059},{"key-phrase":"people's perception","score":0.3071459532},{"key-phrase":"street view image","score":0.3015557528},{"key-phrase":"deep learning model","score":0.300922513},{"key-phrase":"subjective feeling","score":0.2862150073},{"key-phrase":"San Francisco","score":0.2479368597},{"key-phrase":"traffic speed","score":0.1739742607},{"key-phrase":"helpful insight","score":0.1566884369},{"key-phrase":"such study","score":0.1425430477},{"key-phrase":"key factor","score":0.1354164779},{"key-phrase":"nourishing environment","score":0.1316586882},{"key-phrase":"weighted regression model","score":0.119058229},{"key-phrase":"quantitative measurement","score":0.1098248214},{"key-phrase":"previous study","score":0.0848982707},{"key-phrase":"precise location","score":0.0756984502}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":53,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Automated classification of building structures for urban built environment identification using machine learning","Abstract":"The urban environment, especially buildings with different structure types, is difficult to identify automatically due to variation in urban function and form and to buildings\u2019 relatively tacit structural attributes.

Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors concurrently coexist in time and space and can interact, affecting mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain water. It has been difficult for conventional statistical modeling approaches to demonstrate these combined influences due to mathematical constraints. Objectives: To investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. Methods: Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July\u2013December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterward, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on ovitrap index (vector mosquito occurrence) and dengue incidence. Results: The MOB recursive partitioning for ovitrap index indicated a high sensitivity of vector mosquito occurrence on environmental conditions generated by a combination of high residential density areas with low precipitation. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated high sensitivity of dengue incidence to the effects of precipitation in areas with high proportions of residential density and commercial areas. Conclusions: Dengue dynamics are not solely influenced by individual effects of either climate or landscape, but rather by their synergistic or combined effects. The presented findings have the potential to target vector surveillance in areas identified as suitable for mosquito occurrence under specific climatic conditions and may be relevant as part of urban planning strategies to control dengue. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Combined influences; Dengue; Environmental factors; Random forest; Recursive partitioning","Authors":"Francisco M.E., Carvajal T.M., Ryo M., Nukazawa K., Amalin D.M., Watanabe K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2021.148406","x":2.9500000477,"y":3.7799999714,"KeyPhrases":["mosquito occurrence","random forest algorithm","climate variable","conventional statistical modeling approach","high residential density area"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"mosquito occurrence","score":0.5168608427},{"key-phrase":"dengue incidence","score":0.5074188113},{"key-phrase":"Dengue dynamic","score":0.4896155},{"key-phrase":"mosquito development","score":0.4888829589},{"key-phrase":"vector mosquito occurrence","score":0.473012805},{"key-phrase":"dengue disease transmission","score":0.4353468716},{"key-phrase":"climate variable","score":0.4175521731},{"key-phrase":"dengue","score":0.4088528156},{"key-phrase":"mosquito","score":0.3734662533},{"key-phrase":"specific climatic condition","score":0.3361740708},{"key-phrase":"climate factor","score":0.3319689035},{"key-phrase":"conventional statistical modeling approach","score":0.3272362947},{"key-phrase":"rainy season","score":0.2913577855},{"key-phrase":"low precipitation","score":0.2870128751},{"key-phrase":"high residential density area","score":0.2837786674},{"key-phrase":"random forest algorithm","score":0.2745119929},{"key-phrase":"environmental condition","score":0.2714073658},{"key-phrase":"residential density","score":0.2585356236},{"key-phrase":"environmental factor","score":0.2567131817},{"key-phrase":"vegetation data","score":0.2321870327},{"key-phrase":"urban planning strategy","score":0.2167384624},{"key-phrase":"landscape data","score":0.2123955786},{"key-phrase":"Metropolitan Manila","score":0.2122520953},{"key-phrase":"rain water","score":0.1855087876},{"key-phrase":"endemic vector","score":0.1828024089},{"key-phrase":"commercial area","score":0.1620933414},{"key-phrase":"key variable","score":0.1474661529},{"key-phrase":"vector surveillance","score":0.1359315515},{"key-phrase":"individual effect","score":0.1353542507},{"key-phrase":"suitable environment","score":0.1229352057},{"key-phrase":"combined influence","score":0.1058182195},{"key-phrase":"recursive partitioning","score":0.105584614},{"key-phrase":"combined effect","score":0.0784749091},{"key-phrase":"high proportion","score":0.0664574057},{"key-phrase":"respective government agency","score":0.0652132779},{"key-phrase":"Previous study","score":0.0312866941},{"key-phrase":"mathematical constraint","score":0.0298014116},{"key-phrase":"ovitrap index","score":-0.0002850173},{"key-phrase":"high sensitivity","score":-0.0318946987}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":57,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Changes in the Urban Surface Thermal Environment of a Chinese Coastal City Revealed by Downscaling MODIS LST with Random Forest Algorithm","Abstract":"Analysis of the formation and evolution of urban surface thermal environment is crucial for urban planning and improving the environment of a settlement. Qingdao was selected in this study as a typical coastal city undergoing rapid urbanization, and the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of its urban surface thermal environment from 2010 to 2019 were evaluated. The random forest (RF) algorithm was adopted to obtain its land surface temperature (LST) map with 30-m resolution by downscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product; the remote sensing indices emphasizing different land cover types, LST calculated by the radiative transfer equation, and elevation were used as input variables in the algorithm. The heat island intensity (HII), urban heat island (UHI) volume, and UHI grade were used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of the urban surface thermal environment in Qingdao. The results show an increasing trend in average HII between 1.1 and 2.52\u00b0C in the study area over the past 10 years. The northern city appeared to have the highest UHI volume, while change of the UHI volume in Huangdao District of southwestern Qingdao was the most significant. The areas with high HII have gradually expanded during the last 10 years, and the areas with a 10-yr persistently high HII are distributed mainly in old urban areas with high building density and a dense population. Different factors may influence UHI, such as artificial heat sources, surface heat sources, and hybrid heat sources. Finally, adjusting the urban structure, increasing the vegetated area, and changing building colors are proposed to mitigate UHI in the areas with continuously high HII. \u00a9 2021, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Author Keywords":"coastal city; downscaling; random forest; surface thermal environment; urban heat island","Authors":"Xu N., Deng F., Liu B., Li C., Fu H., Yang H., Zhang J.","DOI":"10.1007\/s13351-021-0023-4","x":-6.0599999428,"y":6.2100000381,"KeyPhrases":["land surface temperature","urban planning","random forest","spatiotemporal dynamic characteristic","radiative transfer equation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.5259744525},{"key-phrase":"urban heat island","score":0.4833956957},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4224933982},{"key-phrase":"urban surface","score":0.4195046425},{"key-phrase":"thermal environment","score":0.4130302072},{"key-phrase":"urban structure","score":0.399882555},{"key-phrase":"heat island intensity","score":0.3918002248},{"key-phrase":"old urban area","score":0.3644891381},{"key-phrase":"rapid urbanization","score":0.3350880742},{"key-phrase":"high building density","score":0.3296465874},{"key-phrase":"surface heat source","score":0.316275686},{"key-phrase":"different land cover","score":0.2848718166},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.2566301823},{"key-phrase":"artificial heat source","score":0.2533056736},{"key-phrase":"radiative transfer equation","score":0.2470920384},{"key-phrase":"Huangdao District","score":0.2379041761},{"key-phrase":"typical coastal city","score":0.2323295772},{"key-phrase":"building color","score":0.2159528434},{"key-phrase":"southwestern Qingdao","score":0.2150961459},{"key-phrase":"dense population","score":0.1878980696},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal dynamic characteristic","score":0.1878327727},{"key-phrase":"hybrid heat source","score":0.1874076426},{"key-phrase":"northern city","score":0.1364362389},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1257351935},{"key-phrase":"average HII","score":0.0696709901},{"key-phrase":"UHI volume","score":0.0642563999},{"key-phrase":"input variable","score":0.0406906866},{"key-phrase":"UHI grade","score":0.0349349789},{"key-phrase":"high HII","score":0.0294218287},{"key-phrase":"LST product","score":0.0243235677},{"key-phrase":"UHI","score":0.009132944},{"key-phrase":"Different factor","score":-0.0034376029},{"key-phrase":"m resolution","score":-0.0206717383},{"key-phrase":"HII","score":-0.0226411093},{"key-phrase":"Moderate Resolution Imaging","score":-0.0412947461}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":58,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Exploring the latent manifold of city patterns","Abstract":"Understanding how cities evolve through time and how humans interact with their surroundings is a complex but essential task that is necessary for designing better urban environments. Recent developments in artificial intelligence can give researchers and city developers powerful tools, and through their usage, new insights can be gained on this issue. Discovering a high-level structure in a set of observations within a low-dimensional manifold is a common strategy used when applying machine learning techniques to tackle several problems while finding a projection from and onto the underlying data distribution. This so-called latent manifold can be used in many applications such as clustering, data visualization, sampling, density estimation, and unsupervised learning. Moreover, data of city patterns has some particularities, such as having superimposed or natural patterns that correspond to those of the depicted locations. In this research, multiple manifolds are explored and derived from city pattern images. A set of quantitative and qualitative tests are proposed to examine the quality of these manifolds. In addition, to demonstrate these tests, a novel specialized dataset of city patterns of multiple locations is created, with the dataset capturing a set of recognizable superimposed patterns. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (&lt;2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral sig-natures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R2 values up to 93%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84% of the out-of-sample variation for population density. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This paper outlines the use of a supervised machine learning technique to understand the effects of the urban fabric on surface urban heat island (SUHI) formation in Istanbul, and identify effective variables to provide a basis for research and practice focusing on SUHI mitigation. An analysis using the Ridge Regression Model found that 71% of land surface temperature anomalies in Istanbul are linked to building coverage ratio (BCR), surface\/volume ratio (SVR), sky-view factor (SVF), canyon geometry factor (CGF), and vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI and BCR were the urban fabric components with the highest contribution to SUHI formation, while the effects of SVF and CGF remained relatively low. This research can help planners and designers gauge the contribution of the urban fabric to micro-climate issues and adapt SUHI mitigation strategies for projects aiming to build climate-sensitive urban environments. It also provides insight into and improves knowledge of supervised machine learning approaches to the urban planning and design disciplines. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Istanbul; Land surface temperature; Ridge regression model; Surface urban heat island; Urban fabric","Authors":"Erdem Okumus D., Terzi F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103128","x":-5.8600001335,"y":6.3699998856,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","land surface temperature","Ridge Regression Model","SUHI mitigation strategy","vegetation index"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4885005951},{"key-phrase":"Urban heat island","score":0.4844413996},{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.4591377974},{"key-phrase":"sensitive urban environment","score":0.4514613748},{"key-phrase":"high-density urban area","score":0.4131635427},{"key-phrase":"urban fabric component","score":0.3716760278},{"key-phrase":"micro-climate issue","score":0.3690133691},{"key-phrase":"vegetation index","score":0.3404977918},{"key-phrase":"urban fabric","score":0.319785893},{"key-phrase":"supervised machine learning","score":0.3102390766},{"key-phrase":"Ridge Regression Model","score":0.3064328432},{"key-phrase":"building coverage ratio","score":0.2915365696},{"key-phrase":"local climate","score":0.2578439713},{"key-phrase":"istanbul","score":0.2461433262},{"key-phrase":"supervised machine","score":0.2231303155},{"key-phrase":"fundamental anthropogenic impact","score":0.1947546452},{"key-phrase":"SUHI mitigation strategy","score":0.1747530103},{"key-phrase":"design discipline","score":0.1482507735},{"key-phrase":"SUHI mitigation","score":0.147957623},{"key-phrase":"canyon geometry factor","score":0.1384907961},{"key-phrase":"SUHI formation","score":0.0774927661},{"key-phrase":"designer gauge","score":0.0713109896},{"key-phrase":"SUHI","score":0.070852384},{"key-phrase":"view factor","score":0.069115825},{"key-phrase":"volume ratio","score":0.031419944}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":61,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Smart environment design planning for smart city based on deep learning","Abstract":"Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods have contributed to the progression of models in the different aspects of planning, prediction, and uncertainty analysis of urban and smart cities development in the current scenario. Most developed cities have suffered from severe air quality as population growth and industrialization grow rapidly. Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods. \u00a9 2021","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Smart City (SC); Smart environment design planning; Statistical model","Authors":"Liu L., Zhang Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.seta.2021.101425","x":3.3299999237,"y":3.9000000954,"KeyPhrases":["air pollution forecasting","urban and smart city development","Deep Learning","SAE addresses","human environment"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"air pollution forecasting","score":0.5840935707},{"key-phrase":"urban and smart city development","score":0.4702338278},{"key-phrase":"influence air pollution","score":0.4579757154},{"key-phrase":"air pollution quality","score":0.4435083866},{"key-phrase":"smart city","score":0.4279233813},{"key-phrase":"air quality","score":0.4155676961},{"key-phrase":"Deep Learning","score":0.4119547606},{"key-phrase":"severe air quality","score":0.3723308444},{"key-phrase":"smart environment design","score":0.3628381491},{"key-phrase":"air pollution","score":0.3418314457},{"key-phrase":"Short-Term Memory","score":0.3251392543},{"key-phrase":"developed city","score":0.2830557227},{"key-phrase":"Machine Learning","score":0.2747227252},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.2415643185},{"key-phrase":"human environment","score":0.2044066489},{"key-phrase":"air","score":0.1732294858},{"key-phrase":"uncertainty analysis","score":0.138481304},{"key-phrase":"SAE addresses","score":0.1256333888},{"key-phrase":"low-level simulation","score":0.1177494004},{"key-phrase":"SAE","score":0.1077306122},{"key-phrase":"overall Error rate","score":0.0738634914},{"key-phrase":"current scenario","score":0.0734732375},{"key-phrase":"various area","score":0.0686859936},{"key-phrase":"thorough design","score":0.0633170754},{"key-phrase":"population growth","score":0.0559472106},{"key-phrase":"disappointing result","score":0.0344930179},{"key-phrase":"Government agency","score":0.0241625123},{"key-phrase":"human advancement","score":0.0235079955},{"key-phrase":"effective method","score":0.0221943371},{"key-phrase":"intrinsic component","score":0.0148865692},{"key-phrase":"different aspect","score":-0.0257304534},{"key-phrase":"Conventional method","score":-0.0594963729}]},{"Cluster":21,"Score":0.8613670192,"DocId":62,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"DTEx: A dynamic urban thermal exposure index based on human mobility patterns","Abstract":"Background: Extreme heat in light of climate change is increasingly threatening the health and comfort of urban residents. Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of heat exposure is a critical factor in directing mitigation measures. Current heat vulnerability indices provide insight into heat sensitivities within given communities but do not account for the dynamic nature of the human movement as people travel for different activities. Here, we present a new Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure index (DTEx) that captures the varying heat exposure within urban environments. Methods: We developed the DTEx to understand human heat exposure patterns in a mid-sized city. This index incorporates the human movement pattern and the heat hazard pattern obtained via novel and advanced techniques. We generated the human movement pattern from large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data. The heat hazard patterns were extrapolated via machine learning models from air temperature data measured through vehicle-mounted sensors. The exposure index was then developed by combining the two parameters using their standard-deviation-classified indices. Results: Our exposure index varied between 2 and 12, indicating low to high thermal exposures. Several high-temperature spots associated with a large volume of foot traffic are successfully identified through this DTEx. We observed the hottest spots at shopping plazas but not specifically in the urban center. During the selected football gameday, the exposure index surged across most places near the football stadium but was reduced considerably further away. Discussion: The proposed DTEx is novel because it provides dynamic heat monitoring capability to facilitate heat mitigation strategies at vulnerable locations in urban environments. Combining the mobility data and extensive sensor data generates rich details on the most heat-exposed areas due to human congregation. Such information will be critical for risk communication and urban planning for policymakers. DTEx could also help smart route planning in sustainable cities to avoid heat hazards risks. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Ambient air temperature; Crowdsourcing; Foot traffic; Thermal comfort; Volunteered geographic information (VGI)","Authors":"Yin Y., Grundstein A., Mishra D.R., Ramaswamy L., Hashemi Tonekaboni N., Dowd J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.envint.2021.106573","x":4.5100002289,"y":3.3399999142,"KeyPhrases":["Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure","smartphone location data","machine learning model","climate change","dtex"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure","score":0.6261096001},{"key-phrase":"human heat exposure","score":0.5510771871},{"key-phrase":"dynamic heat monitoring","score":0.4765219688},{"key-phrase":"heat hazard risk","score":0.4568886757},{"key-phrase":"mobility data","score":0.4449590147},{"key-phrase":"heat hazard pattern","score":0.4446497262},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4417695999},{"key-phrase":"air temperature data","score":0.4306058288},{"key-phrase":"heat exposure","score":0.4132323861},{"key-phrase":"smartphone location data","score":0.4087854326},{"key-phrase":"heat mitigation strategy","score":0.4073336124},{"key-phrase":"heat sensitivity","score":0.4009019434},{"key-phrase":"sustainable city","score":0.3666931689},{"key-phrase":"heat","score":0.3562072515},{"key-phrase":"extensive sensor data","score":0.3531073928},{"key-phrase":"smart route planning","score":0.3376678824},{"key-phrase":"high thermal exposure","score":0.3162586093},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3057923615},{"key-phrase":"climate change","score":0.2980672717},{"key-phrase":"Extreme heat","score":0.2972682416},{"key-phrase":"exposure index","score":0.2942837179},{"key-phrase":"foot traffic","score":0.288313508},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.2794041634},{"key-phrase":"Current heat vulnerability","score":0.2658604681},{"key-phrase":"high-temperature spot","score":0.246481508},{"key-phrase":"urban resident","score":0.2415935099},{"key-phrase":"mid-sized city","score":0.2322418094},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal pattern","score":0.2222738266},{"key-phrase":"urban center","score":0.2125514448},{"key-phrase":"human movement pattern","score":0.2113417089},{"key-phrase":"human movement","score":0.2075837404},{"key-phrase":"vulnerable location","score":0.183916986},{"key-phrase":"mitigation measure","score":0.1735586971},{"key-phrase":"shopping plazas","score":0.1564905345},{"key-phrase":"different activity","score":0.1559097767},{"key-phrase":"football stadium","score":0.1460002661},{"key-phrase":"dynamic nature","score":0.144359678},{"key-phrase":"dtex","score":0.1199429631},{"key-phrase":"risk communication","score":0.106684871},{"key-phrase":"Such information","score":0.0886779949},{"key-phrase":"rich detail","score":0.0862427801},{"key-phrase":"large volume","score":0.0726701543},{"key-phrase":"human congregation","score":0.06680464},{"key-phrase":"football gameday","score":0.0525290482},{"key-phrase":"critical factor","score":-0.0037813336}]},{"Cluster":7,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":63,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A Traffic Accident Risk Prediction Model Based on Spatial Gated Memory Network","Abstract":"The prediction of traffic accidents is becoming more and more important in the field of public safety, especially in travel route planning and road safety deployment. Due to the development of deep learning, traffic accident prediction can evolve from traditional machine learning algorithms to neural networks to predict the risk of accidents in a short period of time (hour level) in the future. However, the large urban area and sparse traffic accident samples will bring difficulties to deep learning prediction. If it is not solved, it will easily lead to zero-expansion problems, leading to inaccurate prediction results. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a space-gated memory network (SGMN) based on deep learning. The model combines real-time accident risk, real-time traffic flow, and real-time weather with multiple inputs to predict sub-regions with high accident risk. In order to verify the performance of the model, two real data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the model. The results show that the performance of SGMN is better than that of commonly used memory neural networks such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, Convulsion and Hereto-ConvLSTM, which validates the model. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"deep learning; risk prediction; traffic accident prediction; zero expansion problem","Authors":"Lai S., Zhou C., Song X., Zhang X.","DOI":"10.1109\/EIECS53707.2021.9588055","x":5.27,"y":-1.86,"KeyPhrases":["traffic accident prediction","space-gated memory network","deep learning","large urban area","expansion problem"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"traffic accident prediction","score":0.6637812257},{"key-phrase":"sparse traffic accident","score":0.5260920525},{"key-phrase":"deep learning prediction","score":0.499697566},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.4434879124},{"key-phrase":"space-gated memory network","score":0.4208113849},{"key-phrase":"high accident risk","score":0.4134935737},{"key-phrase":"real-time accident","score":0.4026126266},{"key-phrase":"traffic accident","score":0.3864464164},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.3854731917},{"key-phrase":"road safety deployment","score":0.3531317115},{"key-phrase":"real-time traffic","score":0.3296564221},{"key-phrase":"inaccurate prediction result","score":0.283454448},{"key-phrase":"large urban area","score":0.2618380785},{"key-phrase":"real-time weather","score":0.2371879965},{"key-phrase":"real data","score":0.2014202625},{"key-phrase":"travel route planning","score":0.1970663965},{"key-phrase":"SGMN","score":0.1615826488},{"key-phrase":"expansion problem","score":0.1573905945},{"key-phrase":"public safety","score":0.1532869637},{"key-phrase":"short period","score":0.1529045999},{"key-phrase":"above problem","score":0.1414119303},{"key-phrase":"accident","score":0.1371972561},{"key-phrase":"multiple input","score":0.1272248626},{"key-phrase":"hour level","score":0.0454902798},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.023806775},{"key-phrase":"traditional machine","score":-0.0596669465}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":64,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Big data analytics for identifying electricity theft using machine learning approaches in microgrids for smart communities","Abstract":"Electricity theft (ET) causes major revenue loss in power utilities. It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Author Keywords":"big data; electricity theft detection; hyperactive optimization toolkit; machine learning; smart grids; urban planning","Authors":"Arif A., Javaid N., Aldegheishem A., Alrajeh N.","DOI":"10.1002\/cpe.6316","x":3.4100000858,"y":3.6800000668,"KeyPhrases":["Electricity theft","random forest","synthetic minority","interpolation method","major revenue loss"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Electricity theft","score":0.4942816496},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4793429971},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.4248648286},{"key-phrase":"electricity consumption data","score":0.3550077081},{"key-phrase":"power utility","score":0.3201271296},{"key-phrase":"synthetic minority","score":0.2962979674},{"key-phrase":"Bayesian optimizer","score":0.2901909351},{"key-phrase":"feature vector","score":0.2638945282},{"key-phrase":"feature extraction","score":0.253777504},{"key-phrase":"legal consumer","score":0.209055692},{"key-phrase":"interpolation method","score":0.2028260082},{"key-phrase":"good hyperparameters","score":0.1969121695},{"key-phrase":"residual network extracts","score":0.196385771},{"key-phrase":"ET detection model","score":0.1957081407},{"key-phrase":"data balancing","score":0.1943216324},{"key-phrase":"State Grid Corporation","score":0.1912437379},{"key-phrase":"major revenue loss","score":0.1866448373},{"key-phrase":"SGCC dataset","score":0.1758001745},{"key-phrase":"ET consumer","score":0.109506987},{"key-phrase":"challenging task","score":0.0721335262},{"key-phrase":"considerable amount","score":0.0693278611},{"key-phrase":"SGCC","score":0.0501551032},{"key-phrase":"tuning process","score":0.0365399346},{"key-phrase":"production cost","score":0.0314520486},{"key-phrase":"ET","score":-0.0006144755}]},{"Cluster":19,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":65,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Application of random forest and shap tree explainer in exploring spatial (In)justice to aid urban planning","Abstract":"In light of recent local, national, and global events, spatial justice provides a potentially powerful lens by which to explore a multitude of spatial inequalities. For more than two decades, scholars have been espousing the power of this concept to help develop more equitable and just communities. However, defining spatial justice and developing a methodology for quantitatively an-alyzing it is complicated and no agreed upon metric for examining spatial justice has been developed. Instead, individual measures of spatial injustices have been studied. One such individual measure is economic mobility. Recent research on economic mobility has revealed the importance of local geography on upward mobility and may serve as an important keystone in developing a metric for multiple place-based issues of spatial inequality. This paper seeks to explore place-based variables within individual census tracts in an effort to understand their impact on economic mobility and potentially spatial justice. The methodology relies on machine learning techniques and the results show that the best performing model is able to predict economic mobility of a census tract based on its spatial variables with 86% accuracy. The availability and density of jobs, compactness of the area, and the presence of medical facilities and underground storage tanks have the greatest influence, whereas some of the influential features are positively while the others are negatively associated. In the end, this research will allow for comparative analysis between differing geographies and also identify leading variables in the overall quest for spatial justice. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

For instance, building maps are useful for urban planning, whereas road maps are essential for disaster response services. Traditionally, building and road maps are manually generated by remote sensing experts or land surveying, occasionally assisted by semi-automatic tools. In the last decade, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated their capabilities to extract these elements automatically and accurately from remote sensing imagery. The building footprint and road network detection problem can be considered a multi-class semantic segmentation task, that is, a single model performs a pixel-wise classification on multiple classes, optimizing the overall performance. However, depending on the spatial resolution of the imagery used, both classes may coexist within the same pixel, drastically reducing their separability. In this regard, binary decomposition techniques, which have been widely studied in the machine learning literature, are proved useful for addressing multiclass problems. Accordingly, the multi-class problem can be split into multiple binary semantic segmentation sub-problems, specializing different models for each class. Nevertheless, in these cases, an aggregation step is required to obtain the final output labels. Additionally, other novel approaches, such as multi-task learning, may come in handy to further increase the performance of the binary semantic segmentation models. Since there is no certainty as to which strategy should be carried out to accurately tackle a multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem, this paper performs an in-depth study to shed light on the issue. For this purpose, open-access Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery (at 10 m) are considered for extracting buildings and roads, making use of the well-known U-Net convolutional neural network. It is worth stressing that building and road classes may coexist within the same pixel when working at such a low spatial resolution, setting a challenging problem scheme. Accordingly, a robust experimental study is developed to assess the benefits of the decomposition strategies and their combination with a multi-task learning scheme. The obtained results demonstrate that decomposing the considered multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem into multiple binary ones using a One-vs-All binary decomposition technique leads to better results than the standard direct multi-class approach. Additionally, the benefits of using a multi-task learning scheme for pushing the performance of binary segmentation models are also shown. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Agent-based models that integrate geographical environments to generate crime patterns have emerged in recent years, although data-driven crime simulations are scarce. This article (1) identifies numerous important drivers of crime patterns, (2) collects relevant, openly available data sources to build a GIS-layer with static and dynamic geographical, as well as temporal features relevant to crime, (3) builds a virtual urban environment with these layers, in which individual offender agents navigate, (4) proposes a data-driven decision-making process using machine-learning for the agents to decide whether to engage in criminal activity based on their perception of the environment and, finally, (5) generates fine-grained crime patterns in a simulated urban environment. The novelty of this work lies in the various large-scale data layers, the integration of machine learning at individual agent level to process the data layers, and the high resolution of the resulting predictions. The results show that the spatial, temporal, and interaction layers are all required to predict the top street segments with the highest number of crimes. In addition, the spatial layer is the most informative, which means that spatial data contributes most to predictive performance. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of the inclusion of various open data sources and the potential of theory-informed, data-driven simulations for the purpose of crime prediction. The resulting model is applicable as a predictive tool and as a test platform to support crime reduction. \u00a9 2021","Author Keywords":"2000 MSC: 91D25; 91D10; Agent-based models; Crime prediction; Data-driven models; Location-based social services; Open data; Simulation; Urban data","Authors":"Ros\u00e9s R., Kadar C., Malleson N.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2021.101660","x":4.8800001144,"y":4.2899999619,"KeyPhrases":["Spatial crime simulation","machine learning","crime prediction","individual agent level","spatial layer"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Spatial crime simulation","score":0.770549655},{"key-phrase":"crime prediction","score":0.7135477066},{"key-phrase":"crime simulation","score":0.7025415897},{"key-phrase":"crime pattern","score":0.5791365504},{"key-phrase":"effective crime reduction","score":0.54255867},{"key-phrase":"crime reduction","score":0.5119749904},{"key-phrase":"simulated urban environment","score":0.4938281178},{"key-phrase":"spatial data","score":0.4706700146},{"key-phrase":"crime","score":0.4383845329},{"key-phrase":"virtual urban environment","score":0.4348551035},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained crime","score":0.4249966145},{"key-phrase":"individual offender agent","score":0.3822969794},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3764223158},{"key-phrase":"geographical environment","score":0.3489355147},{"key-phrase":"criminal activity","score":0.3376038074},{"key-phrase":"large-scale data","score":0.3347947001},{"key-phrase":"predictive tool","score":0.3263075352},{"key-phrase":"spatial layer","score":0.3196927309},{"key-phrase":"data layer","score":0.3047335148},{"key-phrase":"individual agent level","score":0.2530966997},{"key-phrase":"top street segment","score":0.2488479763},{"key-phrase":"interaction layer","score":0.2467792779},{"key-phrase":"temporal feature","score":0.2359290123},{"key-phrase":"predictive performance","score":0.2191489935},{"key-phrase":"available data source","score":0.1999560297},{"key-phrase":"various open data source","score":0.1936759055},{"key-phrase":"layer","score":0.1697661579},{"key-phrase":"numerous important driver","score":0.1387310922},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0841503292},{"key-phrase":"test platform","score":0.0813818723},{"key-phrase":"high resolution","score":0.0811680555},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0358482637}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":68,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Geospatial simulation of urban neighbourhood densification potentials","Abstract":"Although densification of urban areas is being proposed as a sustainable urbanisation strategy, frameworks for detailed large-scale analysis of densification potentials and their evaluation are lacking. A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4\u201315 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations.

In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Auto-encoder; Clustering; Graph embedding; Public transit; Smart card data","Authors":"Zhang T., Duan X., Li Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103027","x":5.33,"y":-3.01,"KeyPhrases":["meaningful urban mobility structure","unsupervised clustering","big transit data","graph auto","Shenzhen City"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"meaningful urban mobility structure","score":0.6700764894},{"key-phrase":"urban mobility structure","score":0.6638748646},{"key-phrase":"transit mobility structure","score":0.6252017021},{"key-phrase":"meaningful transit mobility","score":0.6103667021},{"key-phrase":"transit mobility pattern","score":0.5952693224},{"key-phrase":"transit mobility","score":0.5591699481},{"key-phrase":"big transit data","score":0.5440413952},{"key-phrase":"urban topological structure","score":0.5095974207},{"key-phrase":"urban data","score":0.5016341805},{"key-phrase":"public transit movement","score":0.4981986284},{"key-phrase":"sustainable urban transportation development","score":0.4850841165},{"key-phrase":"novel transit mobility","score":0.4767481983},{"key-phrase":"transit management","score":0.4523791671},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised clustering","score":0.4494526982},{"key-phrase":"Mobility structure","score":0.4247959554},{"key-phrase":"local urban function information","score":0.4145641625},{"key-phrase":"mobility community","score":0.4124385715},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4041516185},{"key-phrase":"real-world transit","score":0.4009207189},{"key-phrase":"sustainable urban development","score":0.3736433387},{"key-phrase":"transit","score":0.371658206},{"key-phrase":"large metropolitan area","score":0.3444811106},{"key-phrase":"high-level mobility","score":0.3436126113},{"key-phrase":"resident movement dynamic","score":0.3412104845},{"key-phrase":"similar mobility pattern","score":0.3362518251},{"key-phrase":"graph node","score":0.3267698586},{"key-phrase":"disjoint cluster","score":0.3081192672},{"key-phrase":"travel dynamic","score":0.3052980304},{"key-phrase":"static urban function","score":0.2998184562},{"key-phrase":"mobility","score":0.2958909571},{"key-phrase":"collective movement dynamic","score":0.2891808748},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2842803597},{"key-phrase":"graph auto","score":0.2772014141},{"key-phrase":"Shenzhen City","score":0.2226466835},{"key-phrase":"study region","score":0.1930107623},{"key-phrase":"structure detection problem","score":0.1882540137},{"key-phrase":"holistic overview","score":0.1822101474},{"key-phrase":"low-dimensional vector","score":0.1802182198},{"key-phrase":"gap statistic","score":0.1303471327},{"key-phrase":"informed decision","score":0.1180500388},{"key-phrase":"static information","score":0.1117425337},{"key-phrase":"resilient society","score":0.0901337862},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.0703410059},{"key-phrase":"different part","score":0.0665109754},{"key-phrase":"different source","score":-0.0191735774},{"key-phrase":"Experimental result","score":-0.0440874174}]},{"Cluster":31,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":70,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Meta-regression framework for energy consumption prediction in a smart city: A case study of Songdo in South Korea","Abstract":"Nowadays the concept of smart city has gained in popularity in urban studies. A smart city collects diverse information to monitor and analyze urban systems, such as energy management. It is crucial for smart cities to monitor energy efficiency to be sustainable. In this study, we search to expose the possibilities offered by the energy data of Songdo, a South Korean smart city. First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Energy consumption; Ensemble meta regressor; Machine learning; Smart city; Topical information","Authors":"Carrera B., Peyrard S., Kim K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.103025","x":3.6900000572,"y":3.9400000572,"KeyPhrases":["ensemble model","Korean smart city","energy consumption","base regressors","several machine learning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"ensemble model","score":0.4742293954},{"key-phrase":"ensemble network","score":0.4576486945},{"key-phrase":"smart city","score":0.4360814393},{"key-phrase":"Korean smart city","score":0.4200401604},{"key-phrase":"Gradient Boosting","score":0.413995564},{"key-phrase":"several machine learning","score":0.4038365483},{"key-phrase":"prediction problem","score":0.3574609756},{"key-phrase":"energy data","score":0.3552643657},{"key-phrase":"performance prediction","score":0.3424327374},{"key-phrase":"Neural Networks","score":0.3178583086},{"key-phrase":"energy management","score":0.315841049},{"key-phrase":"regression model","score":0.3114694953},{"key-phrase":"energy consumption","score":0.3107710481},{"key-phrase":"weighted meta model","score":0.2889176905},{"key-phrase":"urban system","score":0.2827308178},{"key-phrase":"energy efficiency","score":0.2738077641},{"key-phrase":"ensemble","score":0.2637155056},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.2446468174},{"key-phrase":"weighted meta","score":0.2405799329},{"key-phrase":"base regressors","score":0.2339425087},{"key-phrase":"baseline regressors","score":0.2258602679},{"key-phrase":"songdo","score":0.1765799671},{"key-phrase":"diverse information","score":0.1430071592},{"key-phrase":"result support","score":0.0944602713},{"key-phrase":"R2 value","score":0.0741705671}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":71,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Evaluation of the environmental impacts of urbanization from the viewpoint of increased skin temperatures: a case study from Istanbul, Turkey","Abstract":"Urbanization is an inevitable process all around the world especially in developing countries like Turkey. Istanbul has been experiencing rapid urban expansion for the past 60\u00a0years. This urban expansion is leading to the replacement of forests by various artificial surfaces. This situation has a critical impact on the natural surfaces due to the alteration of heat energy balance. In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use\/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3\u00a0km2, and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260\u00a0km2. Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years. \u00a9 2021, Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).","Author Keywords":"Istanbul; LST; Random Forest; Urban development; Urban heat island","Authors":"Khorrami B., Heidarlou H.B., Feizizadeh B.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12518-020-00350-3","x":-5.9899997711,"y":6.4800000191,"KeyPhrases":["land surface temperature","urban planning","radiometric image processing","ecological consequence","UHI"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.5032193065},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4773951173},{"key-phrase":"urban development","score":0.4560541809},{"key-phrase":"urban heat island","score":0.4321846962},{"key-phrase":"urbanization indicator","score":0.4264044166},{"key-phrase":"rapid urban expansion","score":0.398820281},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.3874714375},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion","score":0.377282083},{"key-phrase":"continuous land transformation","score":0.3315047026},{"key-phrase":"Landsat imagery","score":0.329777807},{"key-phrase":"istanbul","score":0.3131451607},{"key-phrase":"ecological impact","score":0.3085426688},{"key-phrase":"harsh environmental impact","score":0.3081122935},{"key-phrase":"thermal comfort","score":0.2960809469},{"key-phrase":"radiometric image processing","score":0.2566176355},{"key-phrase":"ecological consequence","score":0.2407485694},{"key-phrase":"statistical analysis","score":0.2332998365},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.2263199091},{"key-phrase":"Skin temperature","score":0.2204324007},{"key-phrase":"heat energy balance","score":0.2184050977},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1762445718},{"key-phrase":"various artificial surface","score":0.1752604246},{"key-phrase":"natural surface","score":0.1363651007},{"key-phrase":"statistical and spectral indicator","score":0.13230519},{"key-phrase":"UHI indicator","score":0.1238781735},{"key-phrase":"artificial surface","score":0.1063790992},{"key-phrase":"good correlation coefficient","score":0.0815141648},{"key-phrase":"UHI","score":0.0670839772},{"key-phrase":"LULC classes","score":0.06409318},{"key-phrase":"inevitable process","score":0.0490935743},{"key-phrase":"accurate measure","score":0.0372561738},{"key-phrase":"critical impact","score":0.0242973827},{"key-phrase":"different date","score":0.0236655995},{"key-phrase":"study period","score":0.002650239},{"key-phrase":"past decade","score":-0.0058856746},{"key-phrase":"upcoming year","score":-0.0170160271},{"key-phrase":"strong link","score":-0.0419825763}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":72,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A novel approach for change detection analysis of land cover from multispectral FCC optical image using machine learning","Abstract":"Land covers refers to the physical land types such as vegetation, water, urban area, roads, and many more according to the geographical region.

Remote sensing and GIS techniques provide spatial and temporal information of land surfaces and are widely used for modeling impervious surfaces. Traditionally, these surfaces are predicted by computing statistical indices derived from different bands available in remotely sensed data, such as the Landsat and Sentinel series. More recently, researchers have explored classification and regression techniques to model impervious surfaces. However, these modeling efforts are limited due to lack of labeled data for training and evaluation. This in turn requires significant effort for manual labeling of data and visual interpretation of results. In this paper, we train deep learning neural networks using TensorFlow to predict impervious surfaces from Landsat 8 images. We used OpenStreetMap (OSM), a crowd-sourced map of the world with manually interpreted impervious surfaces such as roads and buildings, to programmatically generate large amounts of training and evaluation data, thus overcoming the need for manual labeling. We conducted extensive experimentation to compare the performance of different deep learning neural network architectures, optimization methods, and the set of features used to train the networks. The four model configurations labeled U-Net_SGD_Bands, U-Net_Adam_Bands, U-Net_Adam_Bands+SI, and VGG-19_Adam_Bands+SI resulted in a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.1582, 0.1358, 0.1375, and 0.1582 and an accuracy of 90.87%, 92.28%, 92.46%, and 90.11%, respectively, on the test set. The U-Net_Adam_Bands+SI Model, similar to the others mentioned above, is a deep learning neural network that combines Landsat 8 bands with statistical indices. This model performs the best among all four on statistical accuracy and produces qualitatively sharper and brighter predictions of impervious surfaces as compared to the other models. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Google Earth Engine; Impervious surfaces; Machine learning; Remote sensing","Authors":"Parekh J.R., Poortinga A., Bhandari B., Mayer T., Saah D., Chishtie F.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs13163166","x":8.93,"y":-5.8,"KeyPhrases":["deep learning","impervious surface","urban planning","other model","evaluation data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.4489461184},{"key-phrase":"land surface","score":0.4337571561},{"key-phrase":"impervious surface","score":0.4084613025},{"key-phrase":"different deep learning","score":0.3788650036},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3768649399},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.3415939808},{"key-phrase":"GIS technique","score":0.2844154239},{"key-phrase":"neural network architecture","score":0.2841588259},{"key-phrase":"statistical accuracy","score":0.2446084619},{"key-phrase":"impervious","score":0.2402774692},{"key-phrase":"evaluation data","score":0.2207007855},{"key-phrase":"large scale quantification","score":0.2114423215},{"key-phrase":"regression technique","score":0.1981403977},{"key-phrase":"spatial and temporal information","score":0.1876437664},{"key-phrase":"squared error","score":0.1640745252},{"key-phrase":"visual interpretation","score":0.148110956},{"key-phrase":"manual labeling","score":0.1419854909},{"key-phrase":"U","score":0.1307054311},{"key-phrase":"test set","score":0.1212141961},{"key-phrase":"model configuration","score":0.1194032058},{"key-phrase":"other model","score":0.1161920056},{"key-phrase":"SI Model","score":0.113627784},{"key-phrase":"valuable information","score":0.1110905036},{"key-phrase":"statistical index","score":0.1105160117},{"key-phrase":"Sentinel series","score":0.1017260253},{"key-phrase":"modeling effort","score":0.0863941014},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic development","score":0.0757311955},{"key-phrase":"optimization method","score":0.0696301088},{"key-phrase":"extensive experimentation","score":0.0631925166},{"key-phrase":"different band","score":0.0397684835},{"key-phrase":"significant effort","score":0.0334143601},{"key-phrase":"large amount","score":0.0159131289}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":74,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Cloud detection using an ensemble of pixel-based machine learning models incorporating unsupervised classification","Abstract":"Remote sensing imagery, such as that provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat satellites, has been widely used to study environmental protection, hazard analysis, and urban planning for decades. Clouds are a constant challenge for such imagery and, if not handled correctly, can cause a variety of issues for a wide range of remote sensing analyses. Typically, cloud mask algorithms use the entire image; in this study we present an ensemble of different pixel-based approaches to cloud pixel modeling. Based on four training subsets with a selection of different input features, 12 machine learning models were created. We evaluated these models using the cropped LC8-Biome cloud validation dataset. As a comparison, Fmask was also applied to the cropped scene Biome dataset. One goal of this research is to explore a machine learning modeling approach that uses as small a training data sample as possible but still provides an accurate model. Overall, the model trained on the sample subset (1.3% of the total training samples) that includes unsupervised Self-Organizing Map classification results as an input feature has the best performance. The approach achieves 98.57% overall accuracy, 1.18% cloud omission error, and 0.93% cloud commission error on the 88 cropped test images. By comparison to Fmask 4.0, this model improves the accuracy by 10.12% and reduces the cloud omission error by 6.39%. Furthermore, using an additional eight independent validation images that were not sampled in model training, the model trained on the second largest subset with an additional five features has the highest overall accuracy at 86.35%, with 12.48% cloud omission error and 7.96% cloud commission error. This model\u2019s overall correctness increased by 3.26%, and the cloud omission error decreased by 1.28% compared to Fmask 4.0. The machine learning cloud classification models discussed in this paper could achieve very good performance utilizing only a small portion of the total training pixels available. We showed that a pixel-based cloud classification model, and that as each scene obviously has unique spectral characteristics, and having a small portion of example pixels from each of the sub-regions in a scene can improve the model accuracy significantly. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Having collected large quantities of text data from public consultation, the challenge is often how to interpret the dataset without resorting to lengthy time-consuming manual analysis. One approach gaining ground is the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Based on machine learning technology applied to analysis of human natural languages, NLP provides the opportunity to automate data analysis for large volumes of texts at a scale that would be virtually impossible to analyse manually. Using NLP toolkits, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying and visualising shared ideas from large format public consultation. The approach analyses grammatical structures of public texts to discover shared ideas from sentences comprising subject + verb + object and verb + object that express public options. In particular, the shared ideas are identified by extracting noun, verb, adjective phrases and clauses from subjects and objects, which are then categorised by urban infrastructure categories and terms. The results are visualised in a hierarchy chart and a word tree using cascade and tree views. The approach is illustrated using data collected from a public consultation exercise called \u201cShare an Idea\u201d undertaken in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the 2011 earthquake. The approach has the potential to upscale public participation to identify shared design values and associated qualities for a wide range of public initiatives including urban planning. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

These concepts include technical, economic and social innovations. This term has been tossed around by various actors in politics, business, administration and urban planning since the 2000s to establish tech-based changes and innovations in urban areas. The idea of the smart city is used in conjunction with the utilization of digital technologies and at the same time represents a reaction to the economic, social and political challenges that post-industrial societies are confronted with at the start of the new millennium. The key focus is on dealing with challenges faced by urban society, such as environ-mental pollution, demographic change, population growth, healthcare, the financial crisis or scarcity of resources. In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently.

However, human perception (e.g., imageability) have a subtle relationship to visual elements that cannot be fully captured using view indices. Conversely, subjective measures using survey and interview data explain human behaviors more. However, the effectiveness of integrating subjective measures with SVI datasets has been less discussed. To address this, we integrated crowdsourcing, CV, and machine learning (ML) to subjectively measure four important perceptions suggested by classical urban design theory. We first collected ratings from experts on sample SVIs regarding these four qualities, which became the training labels. CV segmentation was applied to SVI samples extracting streetscape view indices as the explanatory variables. We then trained ML models and achieved high accuracy in predicting scores. We found a strong correlation between the predicted complexity score and the density of urban amenities and services points of interest (POI), which validates the effectiveness of subjective measures. In addition, to test the generalizability of the proposed framework as well as to inform urban renewal strategies, we compared the measured qualities in Pudong to other five urban cores that are renowned worldwide. Rather than predicting perceptual scores directly from generic image features using a convolution neural network, our approach follows what urban design theory has suggested and confirmed as various streetscape features affecting multi-dimensional human perceptions. Therefore, the results provide more interpretable and actionable implications for policymakers and city planners. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Recent advances in remote sensing and social sensing data and methods have shown great potentials in mapping urban land use categories, but they are still constrained by mixed land uses, limited predictors, non-localized models, and often relatively low accuracies. To inform these issues, we proposed a robust and cost-effective framework for mapping urban land use categories using openly available multi-source geospatial \u201cbig data\u201d. With street blocks generated from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as the minimum classification unit, we integrated an expansive set of multi-scale spatially explicit information on land surface, vertical height, socio-economic attributes, social media, demography, and topography. We further proposed to apply the automatic ensemble learning that leverages a bunch of machine learning algorithms in deriving optimal urban land use classification maps. Results of block-level urban land use classification in five metropolitan areas of the United States found the overall accuracies of major-class (Level-I) and minor-class (Level-II) classification could be high as 91% and 86%, respectively. A multi-model comparison revealed that for urban land use classification with high-dimensional features, the multi-layer stacking ensemble models achieved better performance than base models such as random forest, extremely randomized trees, LightGBM, CatBoost, and neural networks. We found without very-high-resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery, the classification results derived from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and other open big data based features could achieve plausible overall accuracies of Level-I and Level-II classification at 88% and 81%, respectively. We also found that model transferability depended highly on the heterogeneity in characteristics of different regions. The methods and findings in this study systematically elucidate the role of data sources, classification methods, and feature transferability in block-level land use classifications, which have important implications for mapping multi-scale essential urban land use categories. \u00a9 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI\/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5\u00a0ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sun Y., Gao C., Li J., Gao M., Ma R.","DOI":"10.1007\/s00704-021-03665-2","x":-6.1599998474,"y":6.5100002289,"KeyPhrases":["urban ecological infrastructure","significant cooling effect","machine learning technique","outdoor thermal comfort","Park size"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban ecological infrastructure","score":0.5249480605},{"key-phrase":"outdoor thermal comfort","score":0.503059566},{"key-phrase":"inefficient park","score":0.4752797484},{"key-phrase":"city microclimate","score":0.4480164051},{"key-phrase":"urban heat island","score":0.433077991},{"key-phrase":"Park size","score":0.4125768542},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4094793797},{"key-phrase":"Urban park","score":0.3758558035},{"key-phrase":"cooling benefit","score":0.3576324284},{"key-phrase":"park","score":0.3530938625},{"key-phrase":"significant cooling effect","score":0.3409229219},{"key-phrase":"cooling performance","score":0.3318247497},{"key-phrase":"vegetation greenness","score":0.3138542175},{"key-phrase":"ecological benefit","score":0.3129583597},{"key-phrase":"data envelopment analysis","score":0.2942937613},{"key-phrase":"cooling","score":0.2691546381},{"key-phrase":"efficiency index","score":0.2595718205},{"key-phrase":"relative efficiency","score":0.2442825884},{"key-phrase":"water body coverage","score":0.2138412297},{"key-phrase":"TIRS satellite imagery","score":0.1977054179},{"key-phrase":"urban resident","score":0.1946665347},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan city","score":0.1873329878},{"key-phrase":"correlation analysis","score":0.1719602644},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.1645148695},{"key-phrase":"empirical research","score":0.1432202756},{"key-phrase":"absolute efficiency","score":0.1424573511},{"key-phrase":"effect index","score":0.121921435},{"key-phrase":"current study area","score":0.1040836647},{"key-phrase":"intensity index","score":0.0898322016},{"key-phrase":"UHI effect","score":0.0836496055},{"key-phrase":"research finding","score":0.083432965},{"key-phrase":"relative and absolute perspective","score":0.0546454787},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0326987654},{"key-phrase":"dominant factor","score":0.0010753516},{"key-phrase":"valuable reference","score":-0.0217129979}]},{"Cluster":27,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":80,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Effective task scheduling algorithm with deep learning for Internet of Health Things (IoHT) in sustainable smart cities","Abstract":"In the recent years, important key factor for urban planning is to analyze the sustainability and its functionality towards smart cities.

To prevent and mitigate landslides, various models have been introduced to assess landslide susceptibility. In this paper, Hoeffding Tree (HT), a prevailing data stream mining algorithm, was employed to predict landslide susceptibility in Muchuan County, China for the first time. Meanwhile, Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Bayes Network (BN) were applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for comparison. The model performances were evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUC). To obtain landslide inventory map, 279 landslides data was collected, and training and validation datasets were randomly divided with a proportion of 70% to 30%. Furthermore, twelve conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to rivers, TWI, NDVI, soil, land use and lithology) were selected to construct landslide susceptibility models. Moreover, correlations between conditioning factors and landslides were analyzed using Frequency Ratio (FR). The results showed landslides are prone to occur in areas where human activities concentrate, and all three models exhibited satisfying performances. Concretely, for training dataset, LMT model showed the highest AUC (0.854), followed by HT (0.726) and BN (0.709). However, for validation dataset, LMT and BN models generated similar AUC values (0.761 and 0.764 respectively), and the highest AUC value belonged to HT (0.802). The distributions of landslide susceptibility zones revealed that the interior of county town is mainly seated in low and very low susceptibility zones, whereas regions close to the border suffer high and very high landslide risk. The results acquired in this paper are significant to landslide prevention and urban planning in Muchuan, China.

One of the most prolific application domains is sports analytics due to the availability of real-world multi-agent datasets, where such techniques are used to recognize and predict offensive and defensive strategies in a range of team sports. However, the use of advanced machine learning techniques requires the large datasets to be annotated by domain experts, which is a time-consuming task. Active learning is a methodology that significantly cuts down the data-annotation time on large datasets. In this paper, we investigate active learning strategies to annotate spatio-temporal datasets for the purpose of classification model building. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated on a dataset obtained from professional basketball games to classify an offensive strategy known as 'Pick-and-Roll'. Several neural network architectures are investigated for the classification of more than 900 segments of basketball plays. The results obtained suggest that the proposed, preferred, methodology is well suited for annotating large spatio-temporal datasets and has the potential to be applicable across a range of team sports and non-sports usage scenarios. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Active Learning; Basketball; Machine Learning; Spatio-temporal Data","Authors":"Ai S., Na J., Silva V.D., Caine M.","DOI":"10.1109\/PRML52754.2021.9520715","x":5.63,"y":-2.43,"KeyPhrases":["sport analytics","Active learning","vehicular traffic modelling","spatio-temporal datasets","offensive strategy"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"sport analytics","score":0.5497612953},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal datasets","score":0.4601748586},{"key-phrase":"Active learning","score":0.4247777164},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.4056683183},{"key-phrase":"active learning strategy","score":0.386739701},{"key-phrase":"classification model building","score":0.3846310973},{"key-phrase":"vehicular traffic modelling","score":0.3752697706},{"key-phrase":"professional basketball game","score":0.3582242727},{"key-phrase":"basketball play","score":0.3386300206},{"key-phrase":"team sport","score":0.3385828137},{"key-phrase":"sport","score":0.338296771},{"key-phrase":"non-sports usage scenario","score":0.3144289851},{"key-phrase":"large datasets","score":0.3080812097},{"key-phrase":"offensive and defensive strategy","score":0.307985127},{"key-phrase":"datasets","score":0.2870926857},{"key-phrase":"offensive strategy","score":0.2864342332},{"key-phrase":"domain expert","score":0.25791502},{"key-phrase":"annotation time","score":0.2488756478},{"key-phrase":"real-world multi-agent","score":0.2339634895},{"key-phrase":"prolific application domain","score":0.228635788},{"key-phrase":"Several neural network architecture","score":0.2267384231},{"key-phrase":"advanced machine","score":0.2234584838},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2206752598},{"key-phrase":"such technique","score":0.1837520897},{"key-phrase":"significant interest","score":0.1021349356}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":84,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Urban trip generation forecasting based on gradient boosting algorithm","Abstract":"The four-step transportation model plays an important role in urban planning. The quality of the first phase, i.e. trip generation, determines the performance of the global course. The majority of trip generation forecasting models highly rely on mathematical derivation and have many predictor variables during the prediction, which leads to low accuracy of results and requires laboriously hand-crafted design of input vectors. This paper is the first to introduce the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm for trip generation prediction, and harmonizes such a powerful machine learning method with traditional urban planning requirements to achieve better prediction performance. Unlike the commonly used linear regression method, GBDT can automatically perform feature selection and model the non-linear relationships between input and output variables. Experimental results on real-world residential travel census in Beijing prove that the GBDT model significantly outperforms the baseline and can forecast the trip generation more accurately. \u00a9 2021 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Four-step model; Gradient boosting decision tree; Linear regression; Trip generation","Authors":"Li Z., Xiong G., Zhang Y., Zheng M., Dong X., Lv Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/DTPI52967.2021.9540082","x":5.57,"y":-1.97,"KeyPhrases":["trip generation forecasting","decision tree","urban planning","GBDT","non-linear relationship"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"trip generation forecasting","score":0.6275980473},{"key-phrase":"trip generation prediction","score":0.5680903792},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.4668328166},{"key-phrase":"real-world residential travel census","score":0.4291728139},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3580982685},{"key-phrase":"feature selection","score":0.3521492183},{"key-phrase":"powerful machine learning","score":0.3482265472},{"key-phrase":"trip generation","score":0.3334931731},{"key-phrase":"prediction performance","score":0.3297728896},{"key-phrase":"step transportation model","score":0.2912706435},{"key-phrase":"traditional urban planning requirement","score":0.2698855698},{"key-phrase":"linear regression method","score":0.2685925066},{"key-phrase":"GBDT model","score":0.2682852149},{"key-phrase":"many predictor variable","score":0.244250536},{"key-phrase":"input vector","score":0.2334952056},{"key-phrase":"trip","score":0.2212395072},{"key-phrase":"GBDT","score":0.2177321613},{"key-phrase":"global course","score":0.13800928},{"key-phrase":"non-linear relationship","score":0.133397907},{"key-phrase":"low accuracy","score":0.1223309636},{"key-phrase":"mathematical derivation","score":0.0877333283},{"key-phrase":"output variable","score":0.0662947595},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0118258037},{"key-phrase":"Experimental result","score":0.0066095619},{"key-phrase":"first phase","score":-0.0055866372}]},{"Cluster":23,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":85,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Intelligent control systems in urban planning conflicts: Social media users\u2019 perception","Abstract":"The relevance of this study is determined by the need to develop technologies for effective urban systems management and resolution of urban planning conflicts.

The ever-increasing global capture of cities in 360\u25e6 provides considerable new opportunities for data-driven urban research. This paper provides the first comprehensive, state-of-the-art review on the use of street-level imagery for urban analysis in five research areas: built environment and land use; health and wellbeing; natural environment; urban modelling and demographic surveillance; and area quality and reputation. Panoramic street-level imagery provides advantages in comparison to remotely sensed imagery and conventional urban data sources, whether manual, automated, or machine learning data extraction techniques are applied. Key advantages include low-cost, rapid, high-resolution, and wide-scale data capture, enhanced safety through remote presence, and a unique pedestrian\/vehicle point of view for analyzing cities at the scale and perspective in which they are experienced. However, several limitations are evident, including limited ability to capture attribute information, unreliability for temporal analyses, limited use for depth and distance analyses, and the role of corporations as image-data gatekeepers. Findings provide detailed insight for those interested in using panoramic street-level imagery for urban research. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Among the different methods proposed, the approaches based on supervised machine learning (ML) achieve the best results. This paper aims to investigate building footprint extraction using only high-resolution raster digital surface model (DSM) data by comparing the performance of three different popular supervised ML models on a benchmark dataset. The first two methods rely on a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and a classical ML (support vector machine (SVM)) or a shallow neural network (extreme learning machine (ELM)) classifier, and the third model is a fully convolutional network (FCN) based on deep learning with transfer learning. Used data were obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) and cover the urban areas of Vaihingen an der Enz, Potsdam, and Toronto. The results indicated that performances of models based on shallow ML (feature extraction and classifier training) are affected by the urban context investigated (F1 scores from 0.49 to 0.81), whereas the FCN-based model proved to be the most robust and best-performing method for building extraction from a high-resolution raster DSM (F1 scores from 0.80 to 0.86). \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds segmentation and accurate classification are challenging and crucial to produce different geo-information products like three-dimensional (3D) city designs. This paper introduces an effective data-driven approach to build roof superstructures classification for airborne LiDAR point clouds with very low density and imbalanced classes, covering an urban area. Notably, it focuses on building roof superstructures (especially dormers and chimneys) and mitigating nonplanar objects' problems. Also, the imbalanced class problem of LiDAR data, to the best of our knowledge, is not yet addressed in the literature; it is considered in this study. The major advantage of the proposed approach is using only raw data without assumptions on the distribution underlying data. The main methodological novelties of this work are summarized in the following key elements. (i) At first, an adapted connected component analysis for 3D points cloud is proposed. (ii) Twelve geometry-based features are extracted for each component. (iii) A Support Vector Machine (SVM)-driven procedure is applied to classify the 3D components. (iv) Furthermore, a new component size-based sampling (CSBS) method is proposed to treat the imbalanced data problem and has been compared with several existing resampling strategies. In this study, components are classified into five classes: shed and gable dormers, chimneys, ground, and others. The results of this investigation show the satisfying classification performance of the proposed approach. Results also showed that the proposed approach outperformed machine learning methods, including SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Adaboost. \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"3D classification; imbalanced data; light detection and ranging (LiDAR); Low-density point cloud; roof superstructures","Authors":"Aissou B.E., Aissa A.B., Dairi A., Harrou F., Wichmann A., Kada M.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSEN.2021.3073535","x":9.07,"y":-5.11,"KeyPhrases":["roof superstructure classification","imbalanced data problem","airborne LiDAR point","Support Vector Machine","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"roof superstructure classification","score":0.5469611287},{"key-phrase":"LiDAR data","score":0.5272074342},{"key-phrase":"point clouds segmentation","score":0.4792613983},{"key-phrase":"airborne LiDAR point","score":0.4723141491},{"key-phrase":"Airborne Laser Scanning","score":0.412356317},{"key-phrase":"3D point cloud","score":0.4103482962},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machine","score":0.3981797099},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.3911711574},{"key-phrase":"roof superstructure","score":0.3836233318},{"key-phrase":"accurate classification","score":0.3574267328},{"key-phrase":"connected component analysis","score":0.3353581131},{"key-phrase":"city design","score":0.3353276849},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3216339946},{"key-phrase":"Decision Tree","score":0.3074098229},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3060247898},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.2919513285},{"key-phrase":"imbalanced data problem","score":0.2762908638},{"key-phrase":"satisfying classification performance","score":0.2640551627},{"key-phrase":"imbalanced class","score":0.2639625371},{"key-phrase":"geoinformation extraction","score":0.2569250464},{"key-phrase":"imbalanced class problem","score":0.2523477674},{"key-phrase":"effective data","score":0.2127853632},{"key-phrase":"imbalanced","score":0.2021926492},{"key-phrase":"3D component","score":0.1814344823},{"key-phrase":"Light Detection","score":0.1729103476},{"key-phrase":"raw data","score":0.1571921408},{"key-phrase":"nonplanar object","score":0.121308811},{"key-phrase":"new component size","score":0.1164169237},{"key-phrase":"key element","score":0.1115081757},{"key-phrase":"component","score":0.1031696126},{"key-phrase":"gable dormer","score":0.0906091854},{"key-phrase":"information product","score":0.0848110765},{"key-phrase":"essential tool","score":0.0757786781},{"key-phrase":"low density","score":0.0685075521},{"key-phrase":"different geo","score":0.059249144},{"key-phrase":"main methodological novelty","score":0.0511656478},{"key-phrase":"major advantage","score":0.0019391961}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":90,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Identifying different types of urban land use dynamics using Point-of-interest (POI) and Random Forest algorithm: The case of Huizhou, China","Abstract":"The significant economic development witnessed in China in recent decades has been accompanied by the increasing expansion of urban areas. Although a growing literature has analyzed the characteristics and driving forces of urban land expansion, less attention has been paid to examining the different expansion determinants driving fine-scale urban land use (residential land, administration and public services land, commercial land, and industrial land) change. This paper aims to identify the differences of multi-mechanisms driving fine-scale urban land use expansion based on big data and machine learning, in the Huizhou downtown area in 2000\u20132015. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to identify the natural, transportation, location, social, and POI factors driving land expansion by considering different urban land-use categories. Our RF estimations showed that enormous differences existed between various urban land-use types in terms of the role they played in this expansion and their relation to potential determinants, during the different urban development stages studied. Transportation, location, and the distribution of actual land use were found to exert a greater influence on urban land expansion than other factors. All the findings above provide detailed spatiotemporal knowledge and targeted information that can aid in understanding fine-scale urban land use dynamics. In this way, sound planning strategies for different fine-scale land uses can be formulated more scientifically. The strength of association between these factors and urban land expansion differed greatly depending on the different land-use types involved as well as the urban development stage that it occurred within. These results cast a new light on the importance of investigating the potential driving forces in the expansion of different urban land-use types. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Big data; Driving forces; Fine-scale; Huizhou; Random Forest; Urban land use","Authors":"Wu R., Wang J., Zhang D., Wang S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2021.103202","x":8.73,"y":-3.38,"KeyPhrases":["urban land expansion","Random Forest","POI factor","Huizhou downtown area","fine-scale urban land use"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land expansion","score":0.6631248593},{"key-phrase":"fine-scale urban land use","score":0.6533962488},{"key-phrase":"different urban land","score":0.5490009785},{"key-phrase":"various urban land","score":0.5185121298},{"key-phrase":"land expansion","score":0.480922401},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4732034802},{"key-phrase":"different urban development stage","score":0.4571565986},{"key-phrase":"actual land use","score":0.4493271112},{"key-phrase":"urban development stage","score":0.4295302629},{"key-phrase":"residential land","score":0.4002709687},{"key-phrase":"industrial land","score":0.398424536},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.3914957047},{"key-phrase":"fine-scale land","score":0.3386478424},{"key-phrase":"commercial land","score":0.3244192898},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.314162761},{"key-phrase":"land","score":0.2975069284},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2912533283},{"key-phrase":"Huizhou downtown area","score":0.2818144858},{"key-phrase":"significant economic development","score":0.2774114013},{"key-phrase":"public service land","score":0.2637208402},{"key-phrase":"detailed spatiotemporal knowledge","score":0.2183987796},{"key-phrase":"different land","score":0.1994922757},{"key-phrase":"expansion","score":0.1470507383},{"key-phrase":"use category","score":0.1385734081},{"key-phrase":"sound planning strategy","score":0.1269814372},{"key-phrase":"POI factor","score":0.099249199},{"key-phrase":"other factor","score":0.0916307122},{"key-phrase":"RF estimation","score":0.0875611752},{"key-phrase":"use type","score":0.0742365196},{"key-phrase":"recent decade","score":0.0515273511},{"key-phrase":"different expansion determinant","score":0.0343992114},{"key-phrase":"enormous difference","score":0.0298541244},{"key-phrase":"new light","score":0.0235110968},{"key-phrase":"potential determinant","score":-0.0157869849}]},{"Cluster":19,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":91,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Sustainable development scale of housing estates: An economic assessment using machine learning approach","Abstract":"Economic sustainability is often addressed from the perspective of economic growth and at the national level. In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. \u00a9 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Author Keywords":"density; housing; machine learning; threshold; urban planning","Authors":"Tang B.-S., Ho W.K.O., Wong S.W.","DOI":"10.1002\/sd.2168","x":6.6199998856,"y":4.7600002289,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","Housing value","critical limit","Economic sustainability","household concentration"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5174690485},{"key-phrase":"housing supply","score":0.5077567697},{"key-phrase":"Housing value","score":0.4849354029},{"key-phrase":"housing estate","score":0.4672973752},{"key-phrase":"housing","score":0.4291021824},{"key-phrase":"Economic sustainability","score":0.4286916852},{"key-phrase":"residential unit","score":0.4130650759},{"key-phrase":"Urban planner","score":0.3918341398},{"key-phrase":"economic assessment","score":0.3653419018},{"key-phrase":"human settlement","score":0.352775991},{"key-phrase":"household concentration","score":0.3186991215},{"key-phrase":"population density","score":0.3155199885},{"key-phrase":"economic growth","score":0.290425539},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2735716999},{"key-phrase":"household share","score":0.2675584555},{"key-phrase":"nonlinear economic relationship","score":0.2458489388},{"key-phrase":"threshold scale","score":0.2335085571},{"key-phrase":"estate","score":0.2217647731},{"key-phrase":"local project level","score":0.211627081},{"key-phrase":"development scale","score":0.1924843788},{"key-phrase":"development bulk","score":0.1727162451},{"key-phrase":"Hong Kong","score":0.1723221242},{"key-phrase":"property transaction data","score":0.1656342447},{"key-phrase":"policy implication","score":0.1633024067},{"key-phrase":"common facility","score":0.1443110704},{"key-phrase":"national level","score":0.1384638697},{"key-phrase":"high level","score":0.1322627515},{"key-phrase":"critical limit","score":0.1302574724},{"key-phrase":"possible bottleneck","score":0.0563846156}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":92,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Assessment of combining convolutional neural networks and object based image analysis to land cover classification using sentinel 2 satellite imagery (Tenes Region, Algeria)","Abstract":"Land cover maps can provide valuable information for various applications, such as territorial monitoring, environmental protection, urban planning and climate change prevention. In this purpose, remote sensing based on image classification approaches undergoing a high revolution can be dedicated to land cover mapping tasks. Similarly, deep learning models are considerably applied in remote sensing applications; which can automatically learn features from large amounts of data. Prevalently, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have been increasingly performed in image classification. The aim of this study is to apply a new approach to analyse land cover, and extract its features. Experiments carried out on a coastal town located in north-western Algeria (T\u00e9n\u00e8s region). The study area is chosen because of its importance as a part of the national strategy to combat natural hazards, specifically floods. As well as, a simple CNN model with two hidden layers was constructed, combined with an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA). In this regard, a Sentinel-2 image was used, to perform the classification, using spectral index combinations. Furthermore, to compare the performance of the proposed approach, an OBIA based on machines learning algorithms mainly Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), was provided. Results of accuracy assessment of classification showed good values in terms of Overall accuracy and Kappa Index, which reach to 93.1% and 0.91, respectively. As a comparison, CNN-OBIA approach outperformed OBIA based on RF algorithm. Therefore, Final land cover maps can be used as a support tool in regional and national decisions. \u00a9 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

In this context, analysing changes between two dates is a crucial point. In urban environments, most changes occur along the vertical axis (with new construction or demolition of buildings) and the use of 3D data is therefore mandatory. Among them, LiDAR constitutes a valuable source of information. However, With the difficulty of processing sparse and unordered 3D point clouds, most of existing methods start by rasterizing point clouds (for example to Digital Surface Models) before using more conventional image processing tools. This implies a significant loss of information. Among existing studies dealing directly with point clouds, and to the best of our knowledge, no deep neural network-based method has been explored yet. Thus, in order to fill this gap and to test the ability of deep methods to deal with change detection and characterization of 3D point clouds, we propose a Siamese network with Kernel Point Convolution inspired by Siamese architectures that have already shown their performances on change detection in 2D images and on KPConv network which achieves high-quality results for semantic segmentation of raw 3D point clouds. We show quantitatively and qualitatively that our method outperforms by more than 25% (in terms of average Intersection over Union for classes of change) existing machine learning methods based on hand-crafted features. \u00a9 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

While roadside vegetation barriers can help mitigate TRAP, their effectiveness to reduce TRAP is influenced by site-specific conditions. To test vegetation designs using direct field measurements or high-fidelity numerical simulations is often infeasible since urban planners and local communities often lack the access and expertise to use those tools. There is a need for a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use method to evaluate vegetation barrier designs based on their capacity to mitigate TRAP. In this paper, we investigated five machine learning (ML) methods, including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and neural networks (NN), to predict size-resolved and locationally dependent particle concentrations downwind of various vegetation barrier designs. Data from 83 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations was used to train and test the ML models. We developed downwind region-specific models to capture the complexity of this problem and enhance the overall accuracy. Our feature space was composed of variables that can be feasibly obtained such as vegetation width, height, leaf area index (LAI), particle size, leaf area density (LAD) and wind speed at different heights. RF, NN, and XGB performed well with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 6\u20137% and an average test R2 value &gt;0.91, while SVM and LR had an NRMSE of approximately 13% and an average test R2 value of 0.56. Using feature selection, vegetation dimensions and particle size had the highest influence in predicting pollutant concentrations. The ML models developed can help create tools to aid local communities in developing mitigation strategies to address TRAP problems. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Air quality; Green infrastructure; Machine learning; Particulate matter (PM); Urban designs; Vegetation","Authors":"Hashad K., Gu J., Yang B., Rong M., Chen E., Ma X., Zhang K.M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.144760","x":-5.2199997902,"y":7.8099999428,"KeyPhrases":["vegetation barrier design","random forest","air pollution","computational fluid dynamic","particle size"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"vegetation barrier design","score":0.4827211201},{"key-phrase":"roadside vegetation barrier","score":0.4623219967},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4421095252},{"key-phrase":"various vegetation barrier","score":0.4361853004},{"key-phrase":"vegetation design","score":0.4218841195},{"key-phrase":"vegetation dimension","score":0.3960462809},{"key-phrase":"vegetation","score":0.3631844521},{"key-phrase":"pollutant concentration","score":0.3495129347},{"key-phrase":"vegetation width","score":0.3476359248},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.3434680104},{"key-phrase":"air pollution","score":0.3421013951},{"key-phrase":"near-road environment","score":0.3396749496},{"key-phrase":"ML model","score":0.3249624372},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3204100132},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.2979151011},{"key-phrase":"feature selection","score":0.284438014},{"key-phrase":"leaf area index","score":0.2727445662},{"key-phrase":"leaf area density","score":0.2674444318},{"key-phrase":"wind speed","score":0.2647639513},{"key-phrase":"linear regression","score":0.2468446046},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.2217342705},{"key-phrase":"dependent particle concentration","score":0.2197681218},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1943493038},{"key-phrase":"particle size","score":0.1906230003},{"key-phrase":"feature space","score":0.1623248756},{"key-phrase":"computational fluid dynamic","score":0.1349146366},{"key-phrase":"average test R2","score":0.1287976205},{"key-phrase":"mitigation strategy","score":0.1208296716},{"key-phrase":"specific model","score":0.1130732298},{"key-phrase":"TRAP problem","score":0.1027811617},{"key-phrase":"square error","score":0.1012850851},{"key-phrase":"high-fidelity numerical simulation","score":0.0962270498},{"key-phrase":"local community","score":0.0880488157},{"key-phrase":"use method","score":0.0874634832},{"key-phrase":"adverse health effect","score":0.0529270992},{"key-phrase":"TRAP","score":0.0484451652},{"key-phrase":"direct field measurement","score":0.0036589073},{"key-phrase":"different height","score":-0.0105638318},{"key-phrase":"specific condition","score":-0.0285202358}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":95,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban morphological feature extraction and multi-dimensional similarity analysis based on deep learning approaches","Abstract":"The study of urban morphology contributes to the evolution of cities and sustainable development. Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots\u2019 figure\u2013ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences. This work could serve as a basis for further typo-morphology studies and other morphology-related ecological, social, and economic studies for sustainable built environments. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

In the context of New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot, the availability of up-to-date LULC maps is essential to monitor the impact of extreme events such as cyclones and human activities on the environment. With the democratization of satellite data and the development of high-performance deep learning techniques, it is possible to create these data automatically. This work aims at determining the best current deep learning configuration (pixel-wise vs. semantic labelling architectures, data augmentation, image prepos-sessing, \u2026 ), to perform LULC mapping in a complex, subtropical environment. For this purpose, a specific data set based on SPOT6 satellite data was created and made available for the scientific community as an LULC benchmark in a tropical, complex environment using five representative areas of New Caledonia labelled by a human operator: four used as training sets, and the fifth as a test set. Several architectures were trained and the resulting classification was compared with a state-of-the-art machine learning technique: XGboost. We also assessed the relevance of popular neo-channels derived from the raw observations in the context of deep learning. The deep learning approach showed comparable results to XGboost for LC detection and over-performed it on the LU detection task (61.45% vs. 51.56% of overall accuracy). Finally, adding LC classification output of the dedicated deep learning architecture to the raw channels input significantly improved the overall accuracy of the deep learning LU classification task (63.61% of overall accuracy). All the data used in this study are available on line for the remote sensing community and for assessing other LULC detection techniques. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, the expansion of chain enterprises in new cities brings some challenges because of two aspects: (1) data scarcity in new cities, so most existing models tend to not work (i.e., overfitting), because the superior performance of these works is conditioned on large-scale training samples; (2) data distribution discrepancy among different cities, so knowledge learned from other cities cannot be utilized directly in new cities. In this article, we propose a task-adaptative model-agnostic meta-learning framework, namely, MetaStore, to tackle these two challenges and improve the prediction performance in new cities with insufficient data for optimal store placement, by transferring prior knowledge learned from multiple data-rich cities. Specifically, we develop a task-adaptative meta-learning algorithm to learn city-specific prior initializations from multiple cities, which is capable of handling the multimodal data distribution and accelerating the adaptation in new cities compared to other methods. In addition, we design an effective learning strategy for MetaStore to promote faster convergence and optimization by sampling high-quality data for each training batch in view of noisy data in practical applications. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method leads to state-of-the-art performance compared with various baselines. \u00a9 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Author Keywords":"Knowledge transfer; Machine learning; Meta-learning; Optimal store placement; Urban computing","Authors":"Liu Y., Guo B., Zhang D., Zeghlache D., Chen J., Zhang S., Zhou D., Shi X., Yu Z.","DOI":"10.1145\/3447271","x":6.3,"y":-3.58,"KeyPhrases":["large-scale urban data","Optimal store placement","adaptative meta","training batch","new brick"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"large-scale urban data","score":0.43881464},{"key-phrase":"Optimal store placement","score":0.4255517125},{"key-phrase":"multiple city","score":0.3504076004},{"key-phrase":"large-scale training","score":0.3469521403},{"key-phrase":"new city","score":0.3168395758},{"key-phrase":"optimal location","score":0.3149951994},{"key-phrase":"rich city","score":0.3143475354},{"key-phrase":"adaptative meta","score":0.305331558},{"key-phrase":"other city","score":0.2839527726},{"key-phrase":"different city","score":0.2754188776},{"key-phrase":"store","score":0.2360039353},{"key-phrase":"mortar store","score":0.2317081839},{"key-phrase":"prior knowledge","score":0.2311740965},{"key-phrase":"specific prior initialization","score":0.2227329612},{"key-phrase":"multimodal data distribution","score":0.2219804227},{"key-phrase":"training batch","score":0.2211125195},{"key-phrase":"prediction performance","score":0.2143660784},{"key-phrase":"effective learning strategy","score":0.1923500001},{"key-phrase":"adaptative model","score":0.1906917989},{"key-phrase":"high-quality data","score":0.1815675944},{"key-phrase":"agnostic meta","score":0.1700962037},{"key-phrase":"chain enterprise","score":0.1699485779},{"key-phrase":"multiple data","score":0.1691224873},{"key-phrase":"existing model","score":0.1621037573},{"key-phrase":"noisy data","score":0.1569815278},{"key-phrase":"adaptative","score":0.1549610794},{"key-phrase":"new brick","score":0.1401551515},{"key-phrase":"data scarcity","score":0.1253075451},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.1251086593},{"key-phrase":"data distribution discrepancy","score":0.097792536},{"key-phrase":"various baseline","score":0.0692080557},{"key-phrase":"insufficient data","score":0.0642624497},{"key-phrase":"extensive experimental result","score":0.0560109168},{"key-phrase":"art performance","score":0.0519988537},{"key-phrase":"superior performance","score":0.0489576347},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0354585983},{"key-phrase":"practical application","score":0.0268254653},{"key-phrase":"other method","score":0.0195773933}]},{"Cluster":30,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":98,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Automatic Recognition of Playful Physical Activity Opportunities of the Urban Environment","Abstract":"We investigate deep neural networks in recognizing playful physical activity opportunities of the urban environment.

For the case of the Jiangxia District and Huangpi District of Wuhan, image features, including perimeter, line segment detector (LSD), Hough transform, gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), histogram of oriented gradients (HoG), and local binary patterns (LBP), are calculated, and four machine learning approaches and 25 variables are applied to identify urban poverty and relatively important variables. The results show that image features and machine learning approaches can be used to identify urban poverty with the best model performance with a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.5341 and 0.5324 for Jiangxia and Huangpi, respectively, although some differences exist among the approaches and study areas. The importance of each variable differs for each approach and study area; however, the relatively important variables are similar. In particular, four variables achieved relatively satisfactory prediction results for all models and presented obvious differences in varying communities with different poverty levels. Housing inequality within low-income neighborhoods, which is a response to gaps in wealth, income, and housing affordability among social groups, is an important manifestation of urban poverty. Policy makers can implement these findings to rapidly identify urban poverty, and the findings have potential applications for addressing housing inequality and proving the rationality of urban planning for building a sustainable society. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Traditionally, either urban or regional planning relies on the opinions of demographers in terms of how the population of a city or a region will grow. Multi-regional population forecast is currently possible, carried out mainly on the basis of the Interregional Cohort-Component model. While this model has its unique advantages, several demographic rates are determined based on the decisions made by primary planners. Hence, the only drawback for cohort-component type population forecasting is allowing the analyst to specify the demographic rates of the future, and it goes without saying that this tends to introduce a biased result in forecasting accuracy. To effectively avoid this problem, this work proposes a machine learning-based method to forecast multi-regional population growth objectively. Thus, this work, drawing upon the newly developed machine learning technology, attempts to analyze and forecast the population growth of major cities in Taiwan. By effectively using the advantage of the XGBoost algorithm, the evaluation of feature importance and the forecast of multi-regional population growth between the present and the near future can be observed objectively, and it can further provide an objective reference to the urban planning of regional population. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumer\u2019s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

At an urban level, this study collected various sources of data and proposed a machine learning method (Back Propagation Neural Network - BPNN) to predict different functions of UBCE by BEF in Changxing, a representative small city in China. The study found that UBCE can be significantly affected by BEF such as density, function, and morphology. The BPNN has a good prediction performance on different functions of UBCE, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is stable within 10 %\u201320 %. The prediction results showed that the average value of different functions of UBCE presented an obvious variation. The carbon emission map showed that the high UBCE are mainly clustered in the middle-east and south of the central city of Changxing. By comparison with other studies, the accuracy of this method was proved. This method could be applied to predict carbon emissions of the urban planning scheme. Optimizing the BEF of urban blocks can play key roles in the reduction of carbon emissions and then alleviation of the UHI. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Built environment factors; Low-carbon city; Machine learning; Prediction; Urban blocks carbon emissions","Authors":"Zhang X., Yan F., Liu H., Qiao Z.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2021.102875","x":4.6500000954,"y":3.5199999809,"KeyPhrases":["urban block carbon","machine learning method","environment factor","mean absolute percentage error","carbon emission map"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban block carbon","score":0.4393338561},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4170457125},{"key-phrase":"urban planning scheme","score":0.3863569498},{"key-phrase":"urban heat island","score":0.3786048889},{"key-phrase":"carbon emission map","score":0.3761005402},{"key-phrase":"urban block","score":0.300958693},{"key-phrase":"carbon emission","score":0.2935263216},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.287496537},{"key-phrase":"Neural Network","score":0.2618950009},{"key-phrase":"urban level","score":0.2430421412},{"key-phrase":"environment factor","score":0.2346167117},{"key-phrase":"good prediction performance","score":0.2207377553},{"key-phrase":"prediction result","score":0.2183714658},{"key-phrase":"representative small city","score":0.1805820465},{"key-phrase":"mean absolute percentage error","score":0.1289592385},{"key-phrase":"central city","score":0.1107064933},{"key-phrase":"effective way","score":0.0557905547},{"key-phrase":"BEF","score":0.05076278},{"key-phrase":"UBCE","score":0.0408173129},{"key-phrase":"different function","score":0.0363377966},{"key-phrase":"high UBCE","score":0.0234089904},{"key-phrase":"other study","score":0.009687284},{"key-phrase":"key role","score":0.0046345377},{"key-phrase":"average value","score":-0.0036398713},{"key-phrase":"various source","score":-0.0109456554},{"key-phrase":"obvious variation","score":-0.0650935173}]},{"Cluster":30,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":103,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Learning with self-attention for rental market spatial dynamics in the Atlanta metropolitan area","Abstract":"The rental housing market plays a critical role in the United States real estate market. Prior studies have used various approaches to model housing rent, such as interpolation, hedonic modeling, and machine learning. However, only a few studies have modeled rental prices based on textual data, which provides rich and contextual information about rental properties. In addition, many models, especially deep learning models, use an end-to-end black box for prediction, which hides the decision process. Such models are difficult to interpret and explain the driving factors. This study builds on our previous work, aiming to develop and evaluate rental market spatial dynamics models combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and self-attention mechanism. We compare the performance of the proposed model with our previous models on predicting rental prices in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. We also use techniques from saliency maps to explain the generated model. Results show that the self-attention-based model outperforms our previous models. The saliency map techniques reveal how the model attends to a different part of the textual information. The predicted results reflect the spatial variation of textual information. Such a model offers practical pricing references for homeowners and renters, and spatial patterns for urban planners and stakeholders. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Atlanta; Geographic information systems; Rental price; Self-attention Long short-term memory networks; Spatial modeling","Authors":"Zhou X., Tong W.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12145-021-00589-3","x":4.3000001907,"y":4.5399999619,"KeyPhrases":["real estate market","Short-Term Memory","spatial dynamic model","saliency map technique","urban planner"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"real estate market","score":0.4965646267},{"key-phrase":"rental housing market","score":0.4812691808},{"key-phrase":"deep learning model","score":0.447732836},{"key-phrase":"Short-Term Memory","score":0.4448612034},{"key-phrase":"model housing rent","score":0.4278734624},{"key-phrase":"spatial dynamic model","score":0.4218972921},{"key-phrase":"rental market","score":0.3959552944},{"key-phrase":"saliency map","score":0.3409148753},{"key-phrase":"rich and contextual information","score":0.3366320133},{"key-phrase":"rental property","score":0.3194871545},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3007958531},{"key-phrase":"saliency map technique","score":0.2703126073},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.261343956},{"key-phrase":"attention mechanism","score":0.2552354634},{"key-phrase":"textual information","score":0.2529750466},{"key-phrase":"textual data","score":0.2491036654},{"key-phrase":"spatial pattern","score":0.2482200861},{"key-phrase":"spatial variation","score":0.2447303832},{"key-phrase":"rental price","score":0.2412368357},{"key-phrase":"rental","score":0.2232268602},{"key-phrase":"Such model","score":0.1890862882},{"key-phrase":"practical pricing reference","score":0.1885313392},{"key-phrase":"hedonic modeling","score":0.1777558774},{"key-phrase":"many model","score":0.1703779995},{"key-phrase":"textual","score":0.1560667455},{"key-phrase":"decision process","score":0.1272984743},{"key-phrase":"black box","score":0.1067466736},{"key-phrase":"few study","score":0.0786695555},{"key-phrase":"previous work","score":0.0721934885},{"key-phrase":"different part","score":0.0656672418},{"key-phrase":"previous model","score":0.0649639592},{"key-phrase":"critical role","score":0.0631289631},{"key-phrase":"Result show","score":0.0553128496},{"key-phrase":"Prior study","score":0.0195781682},{"key-phrase":"various approach","score":0.0190508105},{"key-phrase":"United States","score":-0.0095228888}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":104,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Interpretation of contextual influences with explanatory tools: Travel mode likelihood mapping using GPS trajectories","Abstract":"Past studies have failed to address the spatially and temporally varying impacts of environmental factors regarding the uncertain geographic context problem.

Regarding the temporally varying impact, batteries, other offenses, and robberies showed negative associations with the walking prediction to some extent at the afternoon peak (5\u20137:59\u00a0p.m.) during weekdays. The proposed approach will enable meaningful interpretation of complex interactions between multiple environmental factors and individual travel behaviors to suggest policies in urban planning and design. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Lee K., Kwan M.-P.","DOI":"10.1111\/tgis.12729","x":5.98,"y":-3.14,"KeyPhrases":["individual travel behavior","urban planning","machine learning technique","likelihood map","negative association"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"individual travel behavior","score":0.5119035244},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4955059588},{"key-phrase":"uncertain geographic context problem","score":0.4676955342},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal pattern","score":0.3566580713},{"key-phrase":"multiple environmental factor","score":0.3337692916},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.3040368557},{"key-phrase":"environmental factor","score":0.2837119699},{"key-phrase":"spatial dimension","score":0.2690003216},{"key-phrase":"likelihood map","score":0.2681919336},{"key-phrase":"multiple contexts","score":0.2479565442},{"key-phrase":"travel mode","score":0.2447655946},{"key-phrase":"negative association","score":0.2171047926},{"key-phrase":"explanatory tool","score":0.2150389105},{"key-phrase":"local level","score":0.1448030472},{"key-phrase":"meaningful interpretation","score":0.1397136003},{"key-phrase":"temporally","score":0.1216989532},{"key-phrase":"other offense","score":0.1106291041},{"key-phrase":"Past study","score":0.0921695083},{"key-phrase":"afternoon peak","score":0.0784652978},{"key-phrase":"complex interaction","score":0.0695939288},{"key-phrase":"varying","score":0.0601290241},{"key-phrase":"innovative framework","score":0.059672527},{"key-phrase":"notable change","score":0.0457693189}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":105,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Predictive models using \u201ccheap and easy\u201d field measurements: Can they fill a gap in planning, monitoring, and implementing fecal sludge management solutions?","Abstract":"The characteristics of fecal sludge delivered to treatment plants are highly variable. Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"fecal sludge; image analysis; machine learning; Random forest; sanitation; WASH","Authors":"Ward B.J., Andriessen N., Tembo J.M., Kabika J., Grau M., Scheidegger A., Morgenroth E., Strande L.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.watres.2021.116997","x":-5.4099998474,"y":7.5999999046,"KeyPhrases":["fecal sludge","many treatment plant","Random forest","simple analytical measurement","solid-liquid separation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"fecal sludge","score":0.5171604753},{"key-phrase":"sludge","score":0.4673327208},{"key-phrase":"sludge color","score":0.4545245469},{"key-phrase":"treatment plant","score":0.4165607691},{"key-phrase":"many treatment plant","score":0.4132586718},{"key-phrase":"Random forest","score":0.3421219587},{"key-phrase":"Predictive model","score":0.3339241743},{"key-phrase":"laboratory analysis","score":0.3328023255},{"key-phrase":"filtration time","score":0.2928392291},{"key-phrase":"solid-liquid separation","score":0.287592411},{"key-phrase":"analytical capacity","score":0.2686378956},{"key-phrase":"single classifier","score":0.2659473121},{"key-phrase":"image analysis","score":0.2584534883},{"key-phrase":"Simple decision tree","score":0.2494528443},{"key-phrase":"linear regression model","score":0.2439045757},{"key-phrase":"treatment process operation","score":0.2358979136},{"key-phrase":"citywide planning","score":0.2355448306},{"key-phrase":"process control","score":0.2138098031},{"key-phrase":"expert assessment","score":0.2084483802},{"key-phrase":"simple analytical measurement","score":0.196448192},{"key-phrase":"process control parameter","score":0.1654298306},{"key-phrase":"real-time monitoring","score":0.1476252675},{"key-phrase":"questionnaire data","score":0.1306822896},{"key-phrase":"onsite containment","score":0.1071683317},{"key-phrase":"other city","score":0.1008543596},{"key-phrase":"treatment","score":0.0535401925},{"key-phrase":"containment type","score":0.0487894192},{"key-phrase":"supernatant color","score":0.0433771759},{"key-phrase":"efficient and simple field measurement","score":0.0324461795},{"key-phrase":"probe reading","score":0.0200891737}]},{"Cluster":14,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":106,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Machine learning approach to extract building footprint from high-resolution images: The case study of Makkah, Saudi Arabia","Abstract":"Extracting and identifying building boundaries from high-resolution images have been a hot topic in the field of remote sensing for years.

The current study proposes a new automatic morphology-based approach for extracting buildings using high-resolution satellite images of Al-Hudaybiyah region in the city of Makkah as a case study. The proposed technique integrates the support vector machine for extracting buildings that have bright and dark roofs. The appropriateness of this method has been examined by means of various indicators for example completeness, correctness and quality. Preliminary findings will illustrate the precision and accuracy of the used machine learning algorithm.

It presents a proposal for shifting from a traditional approach for generating general-purpose one-size-fits-all geodemographic classifications to application-specific classifications. This proposal addresses the recent scepticism towards the utility of general-purpose applications by employing supervised machine learning techniques in order to identify contextually relevant input variables from which to develop geodemographic classifications with increased discriminatory power. A framework introducing such techniques in the variable selection phase of geodemographic classification development is presented via a practical use-case that is focused on generating a geodemographic classification with an increased capacity for discriminating the propensity for Library use in the UK city of Leeds. Two local classifications are generated for the city, one a general-purpose classification, and the other, an application-specific classification incorporating supervised Feature Selection methods in the selection of input variables. The discriminatory power of each classification is evaluated and compared, with the result successfully demonstrating the capacity for the application-specific approach to generate a more contextually relevant result, and thus underpins increasingly targeted public policy decision making, particularly in the context of urban planning. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Hence, every impact on every scale has a significant role. Those properties of the networks are decisive on the global ecosystem, so how they will be modified by climate change needs serious studies. The vast population of the urban areas exerts significant effects on climate change even though they cover a small proportion of the surface of the Earth; however, impacts of urbanization on climate and ecosystems remain inadequately understood. In the meantime, urbanization continues to increase and in 2030, two-thirds of the population is expected to be living in urban areas with an increasing rate in time. It is of great importance to elaborate on the relations between urbanization and climate. In this respect, the use of information technologies with an extensive computational capacity is one of the cornerstones of climate and urban studies. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the automated recognition of patterns from data. The use of machine learning algorithms can bring significant advantages to both understandings and predicting the climate. The computational power with big data, their ability to capture nonlinear behavior, and learn as new data arrive make machine learning a useful tool for understanding climate and developing urban planning. In this sense, the purpose of this study is to show the advantages of machine learning algorithm by developing a recurrent neural network algorithm to make climate predictions and stating possible effects of machine learning on design and its contribution to understanding the climate. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Architecture; Climate; Climate change; Machine learning; Urban design","Authors":"Koc M., Acar A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.uclim.2021.100820","x":4.1500000954,"y":3.5899999142,"KeyPhrases":["climate prediction","complex network","urban planning","machine learning algorithm","significant effect"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"climate prediction","score":0.6073030233},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.4220634103},{"key-phrase":"recurrent neural network algorithm","score":0.4167793989},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3996114135},{"key-phrase":"climate","score":0.393196106},{"key-phrase":"Climate change","score":0.3913100958},{"key-phrase":"Machine learning","score":0.3654607534},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3363352418},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.3293642998},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.3223270178},{"key-phrase":"global ecosystem","score":0.3148691952},{"key-phrase":"computational power","score":0.2861312628},{"key-phrase":"complex network","score":0.2790605426},{"key-phrase":"ecosystem","score":0.2637090087},{"key-phrase":"computer science","score":0.2528733909},{"key-phrase":"extensive computational capacity","score":0.202301383},{"key-phrase":"new data","score":0.1994824111},{"key-phrase":"vast population","score":0.1589421332},{"key-phrase":"information technology","score":0.1589200795},{"key-phrase":"nonlinear behavior","score":0.1301332861},{"key-phrase":"individual organism","score":0.1205535382},{"key-phrase":"significant effect","score":0.1114735678},{"key-phrase":"useful tool","score":0.1109543592},{"key-phrase":"possible effect","score":0.1007456332},{"key-phrase":"significant advantage","score":0.0752329305},{"key-phrase":"significant role","score":0.0706367716},{"key-phrase":"great importance","score":0.0613700897},{"key-phrase":"serious study","score":0.0052994778},{"key-phrase":"small proportion","score":-0.0596617088}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":109,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A machine learning approach to the simulation of intercity corporate networks in mainland China","Abstract":"This paper explores the potential of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) for the simulation of intercity networks.

The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets.

However, built environments attenuate GPS signals by reflecting or blocking them resulting in some cases multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These effects cause range errors that degrade GPS positioning accuracy. Enhancements in the design of antennae and receivers deliver a level of reduction of multipath. However, NLOS signal reception and residual effects of multipath are still to be mitigated sufficiently for improvements in range errors and positioning accuracy. Recent machine learning-based methods have shown promise in improving pseudorange-based position solutions by considering multiple variables from raw GPS measurements. However, positioning accuracy is limited by low accuracy signal reception classification. Unlike the existing methods, which use machine learning to directly predict the signal reception classification, we use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based method to predict the pseudorange errors by considering the signal strength, satellite elevation angle and pseudorange residuals. With the predicted pseudorange errors, two variations of the algorithm are proposed to improve positioning accuracy. The first corrects pseudorange errors and the other either corrects or excludes the signals determined to contain the effects of multipath and NLOS signals. The results for a challenging urban environment characterized by high-rise buildings on one side, show that the 3-D positioning accuracy of the pseudorange error correction-based positioning measured in terms of the root mean square error is 23.3 m, an improvement of more than 70% over the conventional methods. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Global positioning system (GPS); gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); multipath; non-line-of-sight (NLOS); urban positioning","Authors":"Sun R., Wang G., Cheng Q., Fu L., Chiang K.-W., Hsu L.-T., Ochieng W.Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/JIOT.2020.3037074","x":3.4200000763,"y":1.3899999857,"KeyPhrases":["GPS positioning accuracy","smart city","signal reception classification","pseudorange","decision tree"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"GPS positioning accuracy","score":0.5822341442},{"key-phrase":"GPS signal","score":0.5083926916},{"key-phrase":"global positioning system","score":0.4967668355},{"key-phrase":"positioning accuracy","score":0.4945758581},{"key-phrase":"raw GPS measurement","score":0.4785505533},{"key-phrase":"smart city","score":0.4022561908},{"key-phrase":"D positioning accuracy","score":0.3743288219},{"key-phrase":"low accuracy signal","score":0.3602849841},{"key-phrase":"signal reception classification","score":0.3424959183},{"key-phrase":"NLOS signal reception","score":0.3288352489},{"key-phrase":"signal strength","score":0.3235869408},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3138270974},{"key-phrase":"reception classification","score":0.2923158407},{"key-phrase":"positioning","score":0.2835295498},{"key-phrase":"challenging urban environment","score":0.2810078263},{"key-phrase":"position solution","score":0.2732527256},{"key-phrase":"satellite elevation angle","score":0.2645323575},{"key-phrase":"high-rise building","score":0.2535977662},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2426187396},{"key-phrase":"pseudorange error correction","score":0.2404713929},{"key-phrase":"location information","score":0.2393113524},{"key-phrase":"NLOS signal","score":0.231227234},{"key-phrase":"pseudorange","score":0.2133477032},{"key-phrase":"Things application","score":0.1827150434},{"key-phrase":"Recent machine learning","score":0.1679189652},{"key-phrase":"pseudorange error","score":0.1639714837},{"key-phrase":"square error","score":0.1597390324},{"key-phrase":"range error","score":0.0743362904},{"key-phrase":"effect cause range","score":0.0481780022},{"key-phrase":"conventional method","score":0.0122928135},{"key-phrase":"residual effect","score":0.0112067293}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":112,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Online urban-waterlogging monitoring based on a recurrent neural network for classification of microblogging text","Abstract":"With the global climate change and rapid urbanization, urban flood disasters spread and become increasingly serious in China.

We trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to classify microblogging posts related to urban waterlogging and establish an online monitoring system of urban waterlogging caused by flood disasters. We manually curated more than 4400 waterlogging posts to train the RNN model so that it can precisely identify waterlogging-related posts of Sina Weibo to timely determine urban waterlogging. The RNN model has been thoroughly evaluated, and our experimental results showed that it achieved higher accuracy than traditional machine learning methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT).

Compared with low-and-middle resolution remote sensing images, high-resolution remote sensing images are superior in spatial resolution and display of refined spatial details. Yet its problems of spectral heterogeneity and complexity have impeded research of change detection for high-resolution remote sensing images. As generalized machine learning (including deep learning) technologies proceed, the efficiency and accuracy of recognition for ground-object in remote sensing have been substantially improved, providing a new solution for change detection of high-resolution remote sensing images. To this end, this study proposes a refined NCBAs detection method consisting of four parts based on generalized machine learning: (1) pre-processing; (2) candidate NCBAs are obtained by means of bi-temporal building masks acquired by deep learning semantic segmentation, and then registered one by one; (3) rules and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly adopted for classification of NCBAs with high, medium and low confidence; and (4) the final vectors of NCBAs are obtained by post-processing. In addition, area-based and pixel-based methods are adopted for accuracy assessment. Firstly, the proposed method is applied to three groups of GF1 images covering the urban fringe areas of Jinan, whose experimental results are divided into three categories: high, high-medium, and high-medium-low confidence. The results show that NCBAs of high confidence share the highest F1 score and the best overall effect. Therefore, only NCBAs of high confidence are considered to be the final detection result by this method. Specifically, in NCBAs detection for three groups GF1 images in Jinan, the mean Recall of area-based and pixel-based assessment methods reach around 77% and 91%, respectively, the mean Pixel Accuracy (PA) 88% and 92%, and the mean F1 82% and 91%, confirming the effectiveness of this method on GF1. Similarly, the proposed method is applied to two groups of ZY302 images in Xi\u2019an and Kunming. The scores of F1 for two groups of ZY302 images are also above 90% respectively, confirming the effectiveness of this method on ZY302. It can be concluded that adoption of area registration improves registration efficiency, and the joint use of prior rules and SVM classifier with probability features could avoid over and missing detection for NCBAs. In practical applications, this method is contributive to automatic NCBAs detection from high-resolution remote sensing images. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The accurate mapping of the RLP dynamics require reliable land price prediction models and data with fine spatial and temporal resolution. With the aid of point of interest (POI) data and nighttime light (NTL) images, this paper attempts to explore the ability of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to model grid-level RLPs using the case of Wuhan in China. Several land price prediction models were built using five MLAs and various geographic variables. The experimental results show that the extra-trees regression algorithm and the radial basis function-based support vector regression algorithm perform best in Period \u2160 (2010\u20132014) and Period \u2161 (2015\u20132019), respectively; therefore, they were selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids without observations in the corresponding period. Based on the estimated results, we found that the spatial pattern of the RLP in Wuhan transitioned from monocentric to polycentric between the two periods, and RLPs grew rapidly near newly formed urban subcenters and waterscapes. The relative importance of the predictor variables shows that commercial and educational facilities are important determinants of the RLP distribution in Wuhan; moreover, the relative importance of natural amenities and education facilities increased over time, while that of commercial facilities and public transportation decreased slightly. The case of Wuhan confirms the feasibility of MLAs and openly accessible urban data in modeling fine-scale RLP distributions. Our proposed framework provides a new approach to monitor the urban land price dynamics accurately and closely, which is beneficial for improving the infrastructure layout and achieve smart city growth. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Determinants; Land price distribution; Machine learning; Open data; Spatiotemporal variation; Wuhan","Authors":"Zhang P., Hu S., Li W., Zhang C., Yang S., Qu S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apgeog.2021.102442","x":8.45,"y":-3.18,"KeyPhrases":["urban land price","support vector regression","fine-scale spatiotemporal distribution","smart city growth","various geographic variable"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land price","score":0.5293185711},{"key-phrase":"support vector regression","score":0.4803246856},{"key-phrase":"residential land price","score":0.4730478525},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4666126966},{"key-phrase":"smart city growth","score":0.4548915029},{"key-phrase":"reliable land price","score":0.4312648773},{"key-phrase":"Several land price","score":0.4043586254},{"key-phrase":"residential market","score":0.4041166902},{"key-phrase":"accessible urban data","score":0.3932538331},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.3794646859},{"key-phrase":"extra-trees regression algorithm","score":0.3741520643},{"key-phrase":"prediction model","score":0.3728897572},{"key-phrase":"urban subcenters","score":0.336043328},{"key-phrase":"fine-scale spatiotemporal distribution","score":0.3325850964},{"key-phrase":"various geographic variable","score":0.3239978254},{"key-phrase":"spatial pattern","score":0.2964417934},{"key-phrase":"accurate mapping","score":0.2716244161},{"key-phrase":"land resource","score":0.2679806352},{"key-phrase":"predictor variables","score":0.2608375549},{"key-phrase":"infrastructure layout","score":0.2307278514},{"key-phrase":"radial basis function","score":0.2106925845},{"key-phrase":"model grid","score":0.1797866225},{"key-phrase":"nighttime light","score":0.1704315394},{"key-phrase":"fine-scale RLP","score":0.1607426554},{"key-phrase":"spatial and temporal resolution","score":0.1515261233},{"key-phrase":"RLP distribution","score":0.1379111856},{"key-phrase":"commercial and educational facility","score":0.1356531978},{"key-phrase":"relative importance","score":0.1326792389},{"key-phrase":"natural amenity","score":0.1113460064},{"key-phrase":"rlps","score":0.1029726937},{"key-phrase":"RLP","score":0.1012604013},{"key-phrase":"level RLPs","score":0.0938632414},{"key-phrase":"public transportation","score":0.0710467175},{"key-phrase":"commercial facility","score":0.0549458526},{"key-phrase":"education facility","score":0.0344736725},{"key-phrase":"important determinant","score":0.0324452221},{"key-phrase":"new approach","score":0.0297024883},{"key-phrase":"corresponding period","score":0.0020850785},{"key-phrase":"experimental result","score":-0.0271910615}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":115,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Proposing an effective and inexpensive tool to detect urban surface temperature changes associated with urbanization processes in small cities","Abstract":"A consequence of urbanization is the loss of vegetation cover, replaced by urban areas. This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Change detection index; LST; NDBI; NDVI; Urban heat island; Urban planning","Authors":"Silva A.G.L., Torres M.C.A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2021.107634","x":-5.8099999428,"y":6.2899999619,"KeyPhrases":["urbanization process monitoring","land surface temperature","difference vegetation index","cluster analysis","area's intensification"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urbanization process monitoring","score":0.5238245726},{"key-phrase":"difference vegetation index","score":0.4937602282},{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.4662339389},{"key-phrase":"urban landscape","score":0.4464361668},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4332086444},{"key-phrase":"spatial analysis","score":0.425203681},{"key-phrase":"area's intensification","score":0.4004582167},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.3874211311},{"key-phrase":"cluster analysis","score":0.3855420947},{"key-phrase":"vegetation cover","score":0.3682454228},{"key-phrase":"Change Detection Index","score":0.321279943},{"key-phrase":"means clustering tool","score":0.3020953536},{"key-phrase":"medium-sized municipality","score":0.3015837669},{"key-phrase":"housing complex","score":0.2924830317},{"key-phrase":"municipality","score":0.2842515409},{"key-phrase":"temperature increase","score":0.278079927},{"key-phrase":"surface temperature","score":0.2322654128},{"key-phrase":"heat island's potential","score":0.1918368638},{"key-phrase":"simple methodology","score":0.1835511625},{"key-phrase":"evident increase","score":0.1678055823},{"key-phrase":"monitoring data","score":0.1658869982},{"key-phrase":"priority area","score":0.1325779259},{"key-phrase":"LST change","score":0.1068722606},{"key-phrase":"implantation area","score":0.1007941961},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.0825014412},{"key-phrase":"low-cost tool","score":0.0774715692},{"key-phrase":"CDI value","score":0.0720980018},{"key-phrase":"simple tool","score":0.0622739531},{"key-phrase":"CDI","score":0.0186719578}]},{"Cluster":10,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":116,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Measuring heterogeneous perception of urban space with massive data and machine learning: An application to safety","Abstract":"In the last decade, large street imagery data sets and machine learning developments have allowed increasing scalability of methodologies to understand the effects of landscape attributes on the way they are perceived. However, these new methodologies have not incorporated individual heterogeneity in their analysis, even though differences by gender and other sociodemographic characteristics in the perception of safety and other aspects of landscapes and public spaces have been widely studied in social sciences and urban planning in lower scale studies. In the present study, we combine computational and statistical tools to develop a methodological proposal with high scalability and low implementation cost, which helps to identify and measure heterogeneous perception and its correlation to the presence of elements in the landscape. To achieve this, we implement a survey of perception of public spaces, collecting sociodemographic information of respondents. Then, we fit a discrete choice model to quantify perceptions of these spaces using a parametrization of images that jointly considers semantic segmentation and object detection as input. Our results show heterogeneity in the perception of safety in public spaces according to gender and the observer's habitual mobility choices. The model is then applied to the city of Santiago, Chile. This produces a map of safety perception for different types of users. The proposed method and the obtained results can be a relevant input for the design of public spaces and decision making in the urban planning process. \u00a9 2020","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Heterogeneous perception; Machine learning; Urban space safety","Authors":"Ram\u00edrez T., Hurtubia R., Lobel H., Rossetti T.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2020.104002","x":7.05,"y":-4.46,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","safety perception","semantic segmentation","landscape attribute","large street imagery"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4803813398},{"key-phrase":"large street imagery","score":0.4423867464},{"key-phrase":"public space","score":0.4123561382},{"key-phrase":"safety perception","score":0.4067582488},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous perception","score":0.3971087635},{"key-phrase":"urban planning process","score":0.3761767745},{"key-phrase":"sociodemographic information","score":0.3614400327},{"key-phrase":"perception","score":0.3566903174},{"key-phrase":"habitual mobility choice","score":0.3441570997},{"key-phrase":"social science","score":0.3159181476},{"key-phrase":"landscape attribute","score":0.3097233176},{"key-phrase":"semantic segmentation","score":0.2842153311},{"key-phrase":"object detection","score":0.2679400146},{"key-phrase":"individual heterogeneity","score":0.2678079307},{"key-phrase":"discrete choice model","score":0.2627403736},{"key-phrase":"machine learning development","score":0.2372756451},{"key-phrase":"scale study","score":0.2248987854},{"key-phrase":"computational and statistical tool","score":0.1957064271},{"key-phrase":"gender","score":0.1777857393},{"key-phrase":"result show heterogeneity","score":0.1687379479},{"key-phrase":"methodological proposal","score":0.166198656},{"key-phrase":"new methodology","score":0.1488931477},{"key-phrase":"different type","score":0.1286196411},{"key-phrase":"other aspect","score":0.1216132343},{"key-phrase":"relevant input","score":0.0859360099},{"key-phrase":"high scalability","score":0.0726731569},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0723386556},{"key-phrase":"last decade","score":0.0473658815},{"key-phrase":"low implementation cost","score":0.0406222641},{"key-phrase":"present study","score":0.0116334204}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":117,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Research on urban anti-terrorism intelligence perception system from the perspective of Internet of things application","Abstract":"Objective\/significance: Based on the urgent needs of the status quo of urban anti-terrorism, combining the present situation of intelligent city construction, we carry out the research on the key problems such as the collection and analysis of counter-terrorism information for urban environment.

However, an analysis in the urban environment is very complex in applications, e.g., road detection, city management, and urban planning. One of the important urban features is the detection of the road edges. In this study, an approach on multisensory hyperspectral and LiDAR data fusion (HL-Fusion) is introduced for road edge detection using different machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks. The first results show that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed in the experiments on the study area at Oslo's surroundings in Norway.

It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3\u2212-N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3\u2212-N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Scenario planning; Urban form; Urban sprawl; Water quality","Authors":"Wang R., Kim J.-H., Li M.-H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.144057","x":8.98,"y":-2.66,"KeyPhrases":["urban growth planning","stream water quality","Random Forest","environmental impact","Texas Gulf Region"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban growth planning","score":0.4999408126},{"key-phrase":"different urban development pattern","score":0.4660220742},{"key-phrase":"urban sprawl","score":0.4626829028},{"key-phrase":"important urban development pattern","score":0.4602504969},{"key-phrase":"Urban development pattern","score":0.4599272609},{"key-phrase":"current sprawl development","score":0.4424177706},{"key-phrase":"different urban density","score":0.4259051681},{"key-phrase":"urbanization level","score":0.4217888117},{"key-phrase":"stream water quality","score":0.4208714962},{"key-phrase":"land use planning","score":0.4196697474},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.3598498106},{"key-phrase":"pollutant concentration data","score":0.3468286991},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.3101105392},{"key-phrase":"impacts stream water","score":0.3090470433},{"key-phrase":"environmental impact","score":0.2811225057},{"key-phrase":"coli pollution","score":0.2719941139},{"key-phrase":"scenario prediction","score":0.267739743},{"key-phrase":"Weighted Regression","score":0.2602953911},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2573739886},{"key-phrase":"spatial variation","score":0.2470284998},{"key-phrase":"pollutant generation","score":0.2329777479},{"key-phrase":"Landscape Division Index","score":0.21382007},{"key-phrase":"RF prediction result","score":0.2105502188},{"key-phrase":"wet season","score":0.1704275906},{"key-phrase":"Texas Gulf Region","score":0.1485574394},{"key-phrase":"planning scenario","score":0.1399259269},{"key-phrase":"N concentration","score":0.118019782},{"key-phrase":"Escherichia coli","score":0.1157286242},{"key-phrase":"total phosphate","score":0.1136622727},{"key-phrase":"water","score":0.1088353395},{"key-phrase":"potential mechanistic explanation","score":0.0959440544},{"key-phrase":"SHapley Additive explanation","score":0.0938266814},{"key-phrase":"Patch Cohesion Index","score":0.0906690508},{"key-phrase":"SHAP result","score":0.090031758},{"key-phrase":"empirical evidence","score":0.0751617849},{"key-phrase":"stream","score":0.0626944304},{"key-phrase":"potential risk","score":0.0585722327},{"key-phrase":"Largest Patch Index","score":0.0585026145},{"key-phrase":"Splitting Index","score":0.054674983},{"key-phrase":"such pattern","score":0.0418932661},{"key-phrase":"powerful tool","score":0.0319958739},{"key-phrase":"high density","score":0.0287698973},{"key-phrase":"sampling station","score":0.009111803}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":120,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Using satellite image fusion to evaluate the impact of land use changes on ecosystem services and their economic values","Abstract":"Accelerated land use change is a current challenge for environmental management world-wide. Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004\u20132019) from fused image-ries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Im-ager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use\/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local au-thorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

This study provides new evidence for the links between body mass index (BMI) and the BE at different geographic scales in a unified framework. Based on a sample of 10,962 individuals across 95 cities in China, this study explores the collective effects of the BE attributes at neighborhood and city levels on BMI using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach. Moreover, whether the relationships between the city-level BE attributes and BMI vary across social groups is revealed. The results indicate that the city-level BE attributes have larger collective effects on BMI than the neighborhood-level BE attributes. Specifically, population size is the greatest contributor to predicting BMI, with a relative importance of 13.92% among all influential factors. Moreover, it is found that the effects of city-level BE attributes vary across different social groups. These findings suggest it is of vital importance for urban planners to coordinate both neighborhood- and city-level BE planning to deter the risks of obesity, and urban planning can be more effective if it is implemented considering local socio-demographic characteristics. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Different geographic scales; Interactive effects; Machine learning method; Obesity; Relative importance","Authors":"Wang X., Shao C., Yin C., Guan L.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.cities.2020.103048","x":12.6099996567,"y":0.3400000036,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","body mass index","decision tree","collective effect","different geographic scale"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4316622317},{"key-phrase":"body mass index","score":0.3803032637},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3630218506},{"key-phrase":"BMI","score":0.3541922569},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3425813019},{"key-phrase":"city level","score":0.2854170799},{"key-phrase":"different geographic scale","score":0.2353280336},{"key-phrase":"influential factor","score":0.2259781808},{"key-phrase":"relative importance","score":0.2245723009},{"key-phrase":"population size","score":0.2008396983},{"key-phrase":"attributes","score":0.1805602908},{"key-phrase":"collective effect","score":0.1713461429},{"key-phrase":"different social group","score":0.1452947855},{"key-phrase":"social group","score":0.1410600245},{"key-phrase":"common goal","score":0.1029043943},{"key-phrase":"essential role","score":0.0931566507},{"key-phrase":"vital importance","score":0.0862351805},{"key-phrase":"new evidence","score":0.0244864225},{"key-phrase":"unified framework","score":0.0139853666}]},{"Cluster":6,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":124,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Identifying spatio-temporal hotspots of human activity that are popular non-work destinations","Abstract":"The improved temporal and spatial granularity of data now available from current information technologies offers an opportunity to study previously unexplored dimensions of the relationship between built environment and social outcomes. Within the field of urban studies, an old question worth revisiting with these new technologies is how to best trace the spatial boundaries that circumscribe a place or location to explore non-work activity. In this study, we explore a data-driven definition of places as units of analysis that can be used to explore non-work activity in Singapore. Such a definition of place characterizes an urban space in terms of its concentration of activity and the topology of the built environment\u2013features that are especially important to urban planners. We utilize available smartphone data to develop a systematic framework to identify locations with a concentrated human presence. Using a cylinder moving over a grid representing Singapore, we scan aggregated smartphones locational requests (by time and cell), identifying areas with atypical high concentrations at a given time. Our tool identified 93 places with a concentrated human presence. Direct observation of six of these places at the selected times in conjunction with additional transportation and population data indicated that the topology of commercial establishments provided a strong approximation of non-work activity at a given time and place. Having established the relevance of commercial establishments in approximating non-work activity, then points-of-interest data within the 93 derived places are used to propose a typology of commercial patches, based on their spatial configuration. Nine metrics of the geometry and topology of patches of establishments, such as compacity and their dependence on proximity to shopping malls, were developed. These combined variables revealed more temporal and spatial variety within locations than had previously been recognized. The most popular places for non-work activity were densely configured with various commercial sub-spaces or patches appealing to different lifestyles and income groups. This study suggests that a location\/place can be best defined as a highly detailed, multi-faceted, and always evolving area of activity rather than as a fixed location with temporal and unmovable boundaries. Suggesting a dynamic redefinition of location\/place that builds on other recent work, this work offers potential contributions to locational models for non-work activity. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","Author Keywords":"cell phone data; clustering; Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise; machine learning; Non-work travel; pattern detection; transportation","Authors":"Lopez R.P., Ferreira J.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808320970209","x":6.42,"y":-3.69,"KeyPhrases":["urban space","non-work activity","income group","available smartphone data","locational model"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.6026360989},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.5234458447},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.4222098589},{"key-phrase":"popular place","score":0.4104575813},{"key-phrase":"place","score":0.4048273861},{"key-phrase":"various commercial sub-spaces","score":0.4025155604},{"key-phrase":"locational model","score":0.3962413371},{"key-phrase":"shopping mall","score":0.3768886328},{"key-phrase":"non-work activity","score":0.3760566413},{"key-phrase":"commercial establishment","score":0.3747226},{"key-phrase":"locational request","score":0.3301669955},{"key-phrase":"built environment","score":0.3226258755},{"key-phrase":"population data","score":0.3204830587},{"key-phrase":"activity","score":0.3201392889},{"key-phrase":"temporal and spatial granularity","score":0.3141741753},{"key-phrase":"concentrated human presence","score":0.3118949533},{"key-phrase":"available smartphone data","score":0.2851974666},{"key-phrase":"income group","score":0.271828711},{"key-phrase":"interest data","score":0.2473877221},{"key-phrase":"spatial configuration","score":0.2290183902},{"key-phrase":"different lifestyle","score":0.2218545079},{"key-phrase":"temporal and spatial variety","score":0.2173208445},{"key-phrase":"social outcome","score":0.2071401477},{"key-phrase":"spatial boundary","score":0.204849571},{"key-phrase":"additional transportation","score":0.1730192006},{"key-phrase":"temporal and unmovable boundary","score":0.1547941864},{"key-phrase":"current information technology","score":0.1469635367},{"key-phrase":"unexplored dimension","score":0.1278264076},{"key-phrase":"other recent work","score":0.1142766699},{"key-phrase":"new technology","score":0.106492199},{"key-phrase":"potential contribution","score":0.0988654941},{"key-phrase":"old question","score":0.0880371034},{"key-phrase":"Direct observation","score":0.08790797},{"key-phrase":"atypical high concentration","score":0.0782642961},{"key-phrase":"commercial patch","score":0.0704150796},{"key-phrase":"systematic framework","score":0.0682557151},{"key-phrase":"dynamic redefinition","score":0.0105444267},{"key-phrase":"strong approximation","score":-0.0214649066}]},{"Cluster":6,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":125,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Towards the collaborative development of machine learning techniques in planning support systems \u2013 a Sydney example","Abstract":"The rise of the term \u2018big data\u2019 has contributed to recent advances in computational analysis techniques, such as machine learning and more broadly, artificial intelligence, which can extract patterns from large, multi-dimensional datasets. In the field of urban planning, it is pertinent to understand both how such techniques can advance our understanding of cities, and how they can be embedded within transparent and effective digital planning tools, known as planning support systems. This research specifically focuses on two related contributions. First, it investigates the role of planning support systems in supporting a participatory data analytics approach through an iterative process of developing and evaluating a planning support system environment. Second, it investigates how specifically machine learning planning support systems can be co-designed by built environment practitioners and stakeholders in this environment to solve a real planning issue in Sydney, Australia. This paper presents the results of applied research undertaken through the design and implementation of four workshops, involving 57 participants who were involved in a co-design process. The research follows a mixed-methods approach, studying a wide array of measures related to participatory analytics, task load, perceived added value, recordings and observations. The results highlight recommendations regarding the design and evaluation of planning support system environments for co-design and their coupling with machine learning techniques. It was found that consistency and transparency are highly valued and central to the design of a planning support system in this context. General attitudes towards machine learning and artificial intelligence as techniques for planners and developers were positive, as they were seen as both potentially transformative but also as simply another technique to assist with workflows. Some conceptual challenges were encountered driven by practitioners' simultaneous need for concrete scenarios for accurate predictions, paired with a desire for predictions to drive the development of these scenarios. Insights from this work can inform future planning support system evaluation and co-design studies, in particular those aiming to support democracy enhancement, greater inclusion and more efficient resource allocation through a participatory analytics approach. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.","Author Keywords":"co-design; Machine learning; mixed methods; planning support systems; urban development","Authors":"Lock O., Bain M., Pettit C.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808320939974","x":7.18,"y":-2.79,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","participatory analytics approach","co-design study","effective digital planning tool","machine learning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5416571498},{"key-phrase":"planning support system","score":0.502137959},{"key-phrase":"participatory analytics","score":0.4852535725},{"key-phrase":"participatory data analytics","score":0.4643566012},{"key-phrase":"machine learning planning","score":0.4627574682},{"key-phrase":"participatory analytics approach","score":0.4619798958},{"key-phrase":"effective digital planning tool","score":0.4578181505},{"key-phrase":"co-design process","score":0.4332332611},{"key-phrase":"real planning issue","score":0.4317899048},{"key-phrase":"future planning support","score":0.4148237705},{"key-phrase":"co-design study","score":0.4104442298},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.3953437805},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3488566577},{"key-phrase":"artificial intelligence","score":0.308014214},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.3007953167},{"key-phrase":"multi-dimensional datasets","score":0.2619859576},{"key-phrase":"participatory","score":0.2583032548},{"key-phrase":"support system","score":0.2575846612},{"key-phrase":"democracy enhancement","score":0.2424133122},{"key-phrase":"support system environment","score":0.2388240397},{"key-phrase":"environment practitioner","score":0.2372159809},{"key-phrase":"system evaluation","score":0.2326174676},{"key-phrase":"computational analysis technique","score":0.2280466855},{"key-phrase":"accurate prediction","score":0.2064166367},{"key-phrase":"task load","score":0.1828610301},{"key-phrase":"support","score":0.1807996035},{"key-phrase":"mixed-methods approach","score":0.1769491136},{"key-phrase":"conceptual challenge","score":0.1684192419},{"key-phrase":"simultaneous need","score":0.1521819234},{"key-phrase":"iterative process","score":0.1478067636},{"key-phrase":"related contribution","score":0.1403086483},{"key-phrase":"concrete scenario","score":0.139187932},{"key-phrase":"efficient resource allocation","score":0.1253534853},{"key-phrase":"recent advance","score":0.0753630251},{"key-phrase":"result highlight recommendation","score":0.0543363914},{"key-phrase":"General attitude","score":0.0476570055},{"key-phrase":"such technique","score":0.0222879574},{"key-phrase":"wide array","score":0.0020868555}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":126,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Geosilhouettes: Geographical measures of cluster fit","Abstract":"Regionalization, under various guises and descriptions, is a longstanding and pervasive interest of urban studies.

Currently, various methods such as the machine learning algorithms, statistical methods, and semantic analysis are widely applied to identify and extract human mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose a simple and generic paradigm for mining human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data using complex network analysis. The essential ideas behind the proposed paradigm mainly include (1) creating weighted complex networks of GPS trajectories and (2) extracting the human mobility patterns by analyzing the structures and metrics of the created complex networks of GPS trajectories. To evaluate the performance of the proposed paradigm, we design five groups of experiments and identify the mobility patterns of the selected five persons based on the selected five network analysis metrics. Experimental results indicate that (1) the proposed paradigm is effective and (2) the quite interesting potential information about the human mobility can be mined easily. The proposed paradigm is simple and generic, which can be employed to rapidly identify the human mobility patterns based on the GPS trajectory data. \u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Author Keywords":"complex network analysis; data mining; GPS trajectory; human mobility","Authors":"Wang S., Mei G., Cuomo S.","DOI":"10.1002\/cpe.5335","x":5.51,"y":-2.82,"KeyPhrases":["human mobility pattern","complex network analysis","GPS trajectory data","route recommendation","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"human mobility pattern","score":0.6066548824},{"key-phrase":"human mobility","score":0.5576220751},{"key-phrase":"GPS trajectory data","score":0.464812696},{"key-phrase":"route recommendation","score":0.4578020871},{"key-phrase":"mobility pattern","score":0.4504741728},{"key-phrase":"complex network analysis","score":0.4250325561},{"key-phrase":"complex network","score":0.4167473316},{"key-phrase":"network analysis","score":0.4066793919},{"key-phrase":"weighted complex network","score":0.4015622735},{"key-phrase":"GPS trajectory","score":0.3820701241},{"key-phrase":"traffic planning","score":0.3407280445},{"key-phrase":"mobility","score":0.3319868445},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2597793043},{"key-phrase":"semantic analysis","score":0.2382373512},{"key-phrase":"statistical method","score":0.1950364709},{"key-phrase":"interesting potential information","score":0.1419182718},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.1339841187},{"key-phrase":"emergency management","score":0.114130117},{"key-phrase":"simple and generic paradigm","score":0.0928283781},{"key-phrase":"paradigm","score":0.0923777893},{"key-phrase":"various method","score":0.0724400282},{"key-phrase":"essential idea","score":0.0469616428},{"key-phrase":"Experimental result","score":0.0078794342}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":128,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A study on vehicle detection through aerial images: Various challenges, issues and applications","Abstract":"Nowadays vehicle detection and counting at the border of countries, as well as states\/cities, has become popular through aerial images because of security concerns. It will play a vital role to reduce the various crimes i.e. (children kidnapping, drug\/alcohol smuggling, traffic misconduct, weapons smuggling, sexual misconduct and mission of country-related crime, etc.) at the border of the cities as well as countries. Vehicle detection and counting have various other applications like traffic management, parking allotment, tracking the rescue vehicle in hill areas, digital watermarking, vehicle tracking at the toll plaza and urban planning, etc. However, vehicle detection and counting task are very challenging and difficult because of the complex background, the small size of the vehicle, other similar visual appearance objects, distance, etc. Till now, traditional methodology introduced several robust algorithms which has limitations while extracting the features from aerial images. Recently, deep learning-based algorithms introduced and the outcomes of these algorithms are robust for such kind of applications in the area of computer vision. But accuracy of these algorithms is not optimized in aerial images because the deep learning algorithm required a huge amount of data to train the machine and the size of the object in aerial images is also too small. All these factors affecting the efficiency of the real-time device. This paper provides a brief description of traditional algorithms as well as machine learning and deep learning concepts to identifying the object through aerial images.

In the face of challenges brought about by the demographic transition, there is an urgent need to improve the accuracy of urban land-use mappings to more efficiently inform about urban planning processes. Decision-makers rely on accurate urban mappings to properly assess current plans and to develop new ones. This study investigates the effects of including conventional spectral signatures acquired by different sensors on the classification of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds using multiple feature spaces. The proposed method applied three machine learning algorithms\u2014ML (Maximum Likelihood), SVM (Support Vector Machines), and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network)\u2014to classify LiDAR point clouds of a residential urban area after being geo-registered to aerial photos. The overall classification accuracy passed 97%, with height as the only geometric feature in the classifying space. Misclassifications occurred among different classes due to independent acquisition of aerial and LiDAR data as well as shadow and orthorectification problems from aerial images. Nevertheless, the outcomes are promising as they surpassed those achieved with large geometric feature spaces and are encouraging since the approach is computationally reasonable and integrates radiometric properties from affordable sensors. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is \u221215.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model. An increasingly precise simulation can determine the potential increase area and quantity of urban land, providing a basis to judge the layout of urban land use for urban planners. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the \u201creach angle\u201d method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Indeed, historical maps are often the only source of information when dealing with historical scenarios or multi-temporal (4D) digital representations. The paper presents a methodology to derive 4D building models in the level of detail 1 (LoD1), inferring missing height information through machine learning techniques. The aim is to realise 4D LoD1 buildings for geospatial analyses and visualisation, valorising historical data, and urban studies. Several machine learning regression techniques are analysed and employed for deriving missing height data from digitised multi-temporal maps. The implemented method relies on geometric, neighbours, and categorical attributes for height prediction. Derived elevation data are then used for 4D building reconstructions, offering multitemporal versions of the considered urban scenarios. Various evaluation metrics are also presented for tackling the common issue of lack of ground-truth information within historical data. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012\u20132020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments. \u00a9 2021 Milusheva et al.

From the perspectives of peoples (e.g., passenger, driver, and policymaker), vehicle, road, and environment, this paper describes the current research status of TTOC's big data in six hot topics, including the ridership factor, spatio-temporal distribution and travel behavior, cruising strategy and passenger service market partition, route planning, transportation emission and new-energy, and TTOC's data extensional application. These topics were included in five mainstreams as follows: (1) abundant studies often focus only on determinant analysis on given transportation (taxi, transit, online car-hailing); the exploration of ridership patterns for a multi-modal transportation mode is rare; furthermore, multiple aspects of factors were not considered synchronously in a wide time span; (2) travel behavior research mainly concentrates on the commuting trips and distribution patterns of various travel indices (e.g., distance, displacement, time); (3) the taxi driver-searching strategy can be divided into autopsychic cruising and system dispatching; (4) the spatio-temporal distribution character of TTOC's fuel consumption (FC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a hotspot recently, and there has been a recommendation for electric taxi (ET) in urban cities to decrease transportation congestion is proposed; and (5) based on TTOC and point of interest (POI) multi-source data, many machine learning algorithms were used to predict travel condition indices, land use, and travel behavior. Then, the main bottlenecks and research directions that can be explored in the future are discussed. We hope this result can provide an overview of current fundamental aspects of TTOC's utilization in the urban area. \u00a9 2021 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Cruising strategy and route planning; Ridership factor; Service market partition; Traffic engineering; Transportation emission and new-energy; Travel behavior","Authors":"Lyu T., Wang P.S., Gao Y., Wang Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jtte.2021.01.001","x":5.67,"y":-2.35,"KeyPhrases":["electric taxi","travel behavior research","big data","ridership pattern","TTOC's fuel consumption"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"electric taxi","score":0.5601440668},{"key-phrase":"traditional taxi","score":0.5325694084},{"key-phrase":"taxi","score":0.5302683115},{"key-phrase":"passenger service market","score":0.5119143128},{"key-phrase":"transportation emission","score":0.4876271784},{"key-phrase":"transportation congestion","score":0.4813776612},{"key-phrase":"ridership pattern","score":0.4716692865},{"key-phrase":"ridership factor","score":0.4635336697},{"key-phrase":"travel behavior","score":0.4258642793},{"key-phrase":"travel behavior research","score":0.4253640473},{"key-phrase":"travel condition index","score":0.423904717},{"key-phrase":"various travel index","score":0.40467906},{"key-phrase":"TTOC's fuel consumption","score":0.3628224134},{"key-phrase":"route planning","score":0.3622635603},{"key-phrase":"taxi driver","score":0.3572723866},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.3528808355},{"key-phrase":"online car","score":0.3401378393},{"key-phrase":"multi-modal transportation mode","score":0.3136446476},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3006849885},{"key-phrase":"urban city","score":0.2800886035},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal distribution","score":0.26201123},{"key-phrase":"TTOC's data","score":0.2584250271},{"key-phrase":"TTOC's utilization","score":0.2303669453},{"key-phrase":"greenhouse gas","score":0.2295930535},{"key-phrase":"multi-source data","score":0.2069961131},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.1801356375},{"key-phrase":"distribution pattern","score":0.1345161498},{"key-phrase":"TTOC","score":0.1284780949},{"key-phrase":"extensional application","score":0.1072952226},{"key-phrase":"wide time span","score":0.1051501036},{"key-phrase":"many machine","score":0.1024110913},{"key-phrase":"determinant analysis","score":0.1012083143},{"key-phrase":"research direction","score":0.088755101},{"key-phrase":"main bottleneck","score":0.0737119317},{"key-phrase":"abundant study","score":0.0607992113},{"key-phrase":"quick overview","score":0.0563093275},{"key-phrase":"current fundamental aspect","score":0.0509088039},{"key-phrase":"current research status","score":0.0396960303},{"key-phrase":"hot topic","score":0.0368630439},{"key-phrase":"multiple aspect","score":0.0258592814},{"key-phrase":"unprecedented opportunity","score":0.0188834369}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":135,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Using satellite data to analyse raw material consumption in Hanoi, Vietnam","Abstract":"In this work, we provide an innovative route for analysing urban expansion and population growth and their link to the consumption of construction materials by combining satellite data with material consumption analysis within the Hanoi Province (Vietnam). Urban expansion is investigated with the use of landcover maps for the period 1975\u20132020 derived from satellite. During this period, artificial surfaces and agricultural areas have increased by 11.6% and 15.5%, re-spectively, while forests have decreased by 26.7%. We have used publicly available datasets to calculate and forecast the construction materials consumption and measure its statistical correla-tion with urban expansion between 2007 and 2018. Our results show that official figures for sand consumption are currently underestimated, and that by 2030, steel and sand and gravel consumption will increase even further by three and two times, respectively. Our analysis uses a new method to assess urban development and associated impacts by combining socio-economic and Earth Observation datasets. The analysis can provide evidence, underpin decision-making by au-thorities, policymakers, urban planners and sustainability experts, as well as support the development of informed strategies for resource consumption. It can also provide important information for identifying areas of land conservation and ecological greenways during urban planning. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Recent studies combined the environmental contexts with residents\u2019 global positioning system (GPS) data to delineate the life circles. This method, however, is constrained by GPS data, and it can only be applied in the GPS surveyed communities. To address this limitation, this study developed a generalizable delineation method without the constraint of behavioral data. According to previous research, the community life circle consists of the walking-accessible range and internal structure. The core task to develop the generalizable method was to estimate the spatiotemporal behavioral demand for each plot of land to acquire the internal structure of the life circle, as the range can be delineated primarily based on environmental data. Therefore, behavioral demand estimation models were established through logistic regression and machine learning techniques, including decision trees and ensemble learning. The model with the lowest error rate was chosen as the final estimation model for each type of land. Finally, we used a community without GPS data as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimation models and delineation method. This article extends the existing literature by introducing spatiotemporal behavioral demand estimation models, which learn the relationships between environmental contexts, population composition and the existing delineated results based on GPS data to delineate the internal structure of the community life circle without employing behavioral data. Furthermore, the proposed method and delineation results also contributes to facilities adjustments and location selections in life circle planning, people-oriented transformation in urban planning, and activity space estimation of the population in evaluating and improving the urban policies. \u00a9 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"community life circle; decision tree; demand estimation model; ensemble learning; spatiotemporal behavioral demand","Authors":"Li C., Xia W., Chai Y.","DOI":"10.1007\/s11769-021-1174-z","x":6.4200000763,"y":4.0999999046,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","activity space estimation","life circle","logistic regression","GPS data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5349795818},{"key-phrase":"urban community life","score":0.5053358078},{"key-phrase":"life circle planning","score":0.4428457618},{"key-phrase":"urban policy","score":0.4209962189},{"key-phrase":"location selection","score":0.4021065235},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal behavioral demand estimation","score":0.3980044723},{"key-phrase":"activity space estimation","score":0.3765158951},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal behavioral demand","score":0.35008955},{"key-phrase":"community life circle","score":0.3403533995},{"key-phrase":"GPS data","score":0.3235834837},{"key-phrase":"behavioral demand estimation","score":0.3223807216},{"key-phrase":"environmental data","score":0.3146418333},{"key-phrase":"logistic regression","score":0.3055238128},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.2961114049},{"key-phrase":"behavioral data","score":0.2933271527},{"key-phrase":"circle planning","score":0.2788818479},{"key-phrase":"life circle","score":0.2702943087},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.2700257301},{"key-phrase":"population composition","score":0.2642864585},{"key-phrase":"global positioning system","score":0.2584190071},{"key-phrase":"estimation model","score":0.2433054149},{"key-phrase":"environmental contexts","score":0.2207299471},{"key-phrase":"circle","score":0.2007699311},{"key-phrase":"final estimation model","score":0.1800405085},{"key-phrase":"ensemble learning","score":0.17345801},{"key-phrase":"facility adjustment","score":0.1582223773},{"key-phrase":"delineation method","score":0.1548219621},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.1460076123},{"key-phrase":"accessible range","score":0.1395444572},{"key-phrase":"generalizable delineation method","score":0.1347971857},{"key-phrase":"behavioral","score":0.1342495084},{"key-phrase":"generalizable method","score":0.1084636375},{"key-phrase":"core task","score":0.0773610473},{"key-phrase":"delineation result","score":0.0687974244},{"key-phrase":"previous research","score":0.0685042962},{"key-phrase":"essential prerequisite","score":0.0659424067},{"key-phrase":"error rate","score":0.0528521612},{"key-phrase":"Recent study","score":0.0474884883},{"key-phrase":"internal structure","score":0.0371533632}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":137,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Use of deep learning models in street-level images to classify one-story unreinforced masonry buildings based on roof diaphragms","Abstract":"In this paper, we explore the potential of convolutional neural networks to classify street-level imagery of one-story unreinforced masonry buildings (MURs) according to the flexibility of the roof diaphragm (rigid or flexible).

Modelling of residential location choice of urban population with random forest","Abstract":"The most common approach to assessing natural hazard risk is investigating the willingness to pay in the presence or absence of such risk. In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus. Avenues for future research include the operational strengthening of these linkages for more effective disaster risk management. \u00a9 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc..

However, it changes rapidly with economic growth. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based photogrammetry works well in this situation with its advantages of quick and high-resolution data updating. In this paper, in order to improve building extraction accuracy in complex areas where buildings are characterized by various patterns, complex structures, and unique styles, we present a framework which applies deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation to UAV images with digital surface model (DSM) and visible-band difference vegetation index (VDVI). The results show that extraction accuracy improves. The combination of red, green, blue (RGB) and VDVI bands (RGBVI) can effectively distinguish the building area and vegetation. The application of RGB with DSM bands (RGBD) helps separate buildings from ground objects. The combination of RGB, DSM, and VDVI bands (RGBDVI) can identify small buildings which are usually not high and covered partly by tree branches. The proposed method is further applied to an open standard dataset to evaluate its robustness and results indicate an increased overall accuracy from RGB only (93%) to RGBD (97%). \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Boonpook W., Tan Y., Xu B.","DOI":"10.1080\/01431161.2020.1788742","x":9.2,"y":-5.72,"KeyPhrases":["semantic segmentation","UAV image","building extraction accuracy","vegetation index","deep learning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"semantic segmentation","score":0.4493256807},{"key-phrase":"building extraction accuracy","score":0.4087039232},{"key-phrase":"UAV image","score":0.3907833695},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.3668992221},{"key-phrase":"Unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.3519415557},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3128631413},{"key-phrase":"vegetation index","score":0.3058831692},{"key-phrase":"building area","score":0.2934952378},{"key-phrase":"photogrammetry work","score":0.289319247},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution data","score":0.2577998042},{"key-phrase":"geographic information system","score":0.2363342941},{"key-phrase":"RGB","score":0.2354383767},{"key-phrase":"VDVI","score":0.2311053276},{"key-phrase":"complex area","score":0.2254213244},{"key-phrase":"digital surface model","score":0.2083331347},{"key-phrase":"extraction accuracy","score":0.2049287558},{"key-phrase":"separate building","score":0.194699958},{"key-phrase":"VDVI band","score":0.1869418323},{"key-phrase":"complex structure","score":0.1855272949},{"key-phrase":"open standard dataset","score":0.1680394709},{"key-phrase":"small building","score":0.1452543139},{"key-phrase":"ground object","score":0.1432352215},{"key-phrase":"visible-band difference","score":0.1355638504},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1158513278},{"key-phrase":"various pattern","score":0.0957236141},{"key-phrase":"tree branch","score":0.0906899795},{"key-phrase":"unique style","score":0.074555926},{"key-phrase":"economic growth","score":0.0660485327},{"key-phrase":"essential part","score":0.0532388911},{"key-phrase":"DSM band","score":0.0299990252},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":-0.011467454}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":142,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Research on Seasonal PM 2.5 Predication in Hangzhou City Based on SSA-ELM Model","Abstract":"PM2.5 concentration is the main factor of air pollution, and accurate prediction of PM2.5 concentration can provide better preventive measures for urban governance.

To accommodate urban planning for these changes, cities, and communities need to know how many (micromobility) vehicles are on the road. In this work, we design a concept for a compact, mobile, and energy-efficient system to classify and count micromobility vehicles. We aim for a battery-powered system, which can be installed in a short time by a single person and is non-invasive for the ground or traffic. For this purpose, we investigate a system architecture consisting of uncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging sensors and a neuromorphic co-processor. This processor can perform classifications in a fixed time of 16,2\u03bcs without requiring additional hardware for learning. It can adapt its knowledge base to new environments without external updates. Our system is aimed to achieve adequate accuracy only using a low-resolution sensor and moderate processing power. We will show that an object representation of only 256 Bytes is sufficient to achieve a four-class classification accuracy higher than 80%, with an overall power consumption of less than 7mW. We estimate a total operating time of at least two weeks using a common 12V 17Ah lead battery. \u00a9 2021 SPIE.

RS image classification is a recent technology used to extract hidden information from remotely sensed images in the observed earth environment. This classification is essential for sustainable development in agricultural decisions and urban planning using deep learning (DL) methods. DL gets more attention for accuracy and performance improvements in large datasets. This paper is aimed to apply one of the DL methods called transfer learning (TL). TL is the recent research problem in machine learning and DL approaches for image classification. DL consumes much time for training when starting from scratch. This problem could be overcome in the TL modeling technique, which uses pre-trained models to build deep TL models efficiently. We applied the TL model using bottleneck feature extraction from the pre-trained models: InceptionV3, Resnet50V2, and VGG19 to LCLU classification in the UC Merced dataset. With these experiments, the TL model has been built the outdate performance of 92.46, 94.38, and 99.64 in Resnet50V2, InceptionV3, and VGG19, respectively. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

In many of these applications, the UAV is required to self-navigate in highly dynamic urban environments. This means that the UAV must have the ability to determine its location in an autonomous and real time manner. Existing localization techniques rely mainly on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and do not provide a reliable real time localization solution, particularly in dense urban environments. Our objective is to propose an effective alternative solution to enable the UAV to autonomously determine its location independent of the GPS and without message exchanges. We therefore propose utilizing the existing 5G cellular infrastructure to enable the UAV to determine its 3-D location without the need to interact with the cellular network. We formulate the UAV localization problem to minimize the error of the RSSI measurements from the surrounding cellular base stations. While exact optimization techniques can be applied to accurately solve such a problem, they cannot provide the real time calculation that is needed in such dynamic applications. Machine learning based techniques are strong candidates to provide an attractive alternative to provide a near-optimal localization solution with the needed practical real-time calculation. Accordingly, we propose two machine learning-based approaches, namely, deep neural network and reinforcement learning based approaches, to solve the formulated UAV localization problem in real time. We then provide a detailed comparative analysis for each of the proposed localization techniques along with a comparison with the optimization-based techniques as well as other techniques from the literature. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"5G; deep learning; neural networks; optimization; Q-learning; reinforcement learning; UAV 3-D autonomous localization","Authors":"Afifi G., Gadallah Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2021.3126775","x":4.1100001335,"y":1.2400000095,"KeyPhrases":["UAV localization problem","deep neural network","dynamic urban environment","cellular base station","RSSI measurement"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"UAV localization problem","score":0.5891163945},{"key-phrase":"reliable real time localization","score":0.4829974771},{"key-phrase":"UAV","score":0.48053056},{"key-phrase":"near-optimal localization","score":0.4456119239},{"key-phrase":"Unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.4376212955},{"key-phrase":"Global Positioning System","score":0.4238654971},{"key-phrase":"localization technique","score":0.3949008584},{"key-phrase":"autonomous and real time manner","score":0.3723686934},{"key-phrase":"deep neural network","score":0.359380126},{"key-phrase":"cellular network","score":0.3474656641},{"key-phrase":"cellular base station","score":0.3272476196},{"key-phrase":"cellular infrastructure","score":0.3237729669},{"key-phrase":"dynamic urban environment","score":0.3230739832},{"key-phrase":"RSSI measurement","score":0.2710962892},{"key-phrase":"dense urban environment","score":0.2669213116},{"key-phrase":"localization","score":0.2603968382},{"key-phrase":"real time","score":0.2520649433},{"key-phrase":"real time calculation","score":0.2483030707},{"key-phrase":"real-time calculation","score":0.2479857951},{"key-phrase":"Machine learning","score":0.2379789054},{"key-phrase":"D location","score":0.2132694423},{"key-phrase":"commercial and military application","score":0.2008651197},{"key-phrase":"such dynamic application","score":0.178126961},{"key-phrase":"exact optimization technique","score":0.1707857251},{"key-phrase":"effective alternative solution","score":0.0935923383},{"key-phrase":"other technique","score":0.0888745934},{"key-phrase":"message exchange","score":0.0399237052},{"key-phrase":"strong candidate","score":0.0203510225},{"key-phrase":"detailed comparative analysis","score":-0.0092984438},{"key-phrase":"integral part","score":-0.039158769},{"key-phrase":"attractive alternative","score":-0.0400908515}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":150,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Environmentally sustainable urban development and internet of things connected sensors in cognitive smart cities","Abstract":"Based on an in-depth survey of the literature, the purpose of the paper is to explore environmentally sustainable urban development and Internet of Things connected sensors in cognitive smart cities.

The overall accuracy for random forest, maximum likelihood, support vector machines, and backpropagation were 97%, 95%, 93% and 92% respectively. It was found that random forest was the best option, followed by maximum likelihood, while the least effective was the backpropagation neural network.

An intelligent transportation system can analyze the traffic data with time and space characteristics in the city and acquire rich and valuable knowledge, and it is of great significance to realize intelligent traffic scheduling and urban planning. This article specifically introduces the extensive application of urban transportation infrastructure data in the construction and development of smart cities. This article first explains the related concepts of big data and intelligent transportation systems and uses big data to illustrate the operation of intelligent transportation systems in the construction of smart cities. Based on the machine learning and deep learning method, this paper is aimed at the passenger flow and traffic flow in the smart city transportation system. This paper deeply excavates the time, space, and other hidden features. In this paper, the traffic volume of the random sections in the city is predicted by using the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model, and the data are compared with the other five models (VAR, FNN, GCGRU, STGCN, and DGCNN). The experimental results show that compared with the other 4 models, the GCNN model has an increase of 8% to 10% accuracy and 15% fault tolerance. In forecasting morning and evening peak traffic flow, the accuracy of the GCNN model is higher than that of other models, and its trend is basically consistent with the actual traffic volume, the predicted results can reflect the actual traffic flow data well. Aimed at the application of intelligent transportation in an intelligent city, this paper proposes a machine learning prediction model based on big data, and this is of great significance for studying the mechanical learning of such problems. Therefore, the research of this paper has a good implementation prospect and academic value. \u00a9 2021 Gongxing Yan and Yanping Chen.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Yan G., Chen Y.","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/3833562","x":5.23,"y":-2.01,"KeyPhrases":["smart city transportation","GCNN model","actual traffic volume","big data","forecasting morning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"smart city transportation","score":0.5696960092},{"key-phrase":"intelligent transportation system","score":0.4898630977},{"key-phrase":"smart city","score":0.4599742889},{"key-phrase":"intelligent city","score":0.4559904933},{"key-phrase":"deep learning method","score":0.4499379992},{"key-phrase":"traffic data","score":0.4403104186},{"key-phrase":"intelligent transportation","score":0.4156403244},{"key-phrase":"intelligent traffic scheduling","score":0.3985514939},{"key-phrase":"traffic flow","score":0.3886922896},{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.3838420808},{"key-phrase":"actual traffic flow","score":0.3802470565},{"key-phrase":"urban transportation infrastructure","score":0.3719244003},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.3715174794},{"key-phrase":"GCNN model","score":0.3699436486},{"key-phrase":"traffic volume","score":0.3550454974},{"key-phrase":"evening peak traffic","score":0.3340233266},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3217583299},{"key-phrase":"prediction model","score":0.3215060532},{"key-phrase":"actual traffic volume","score":0.317032516},{"key-phrase":"passenger flow","score":0.3089350164},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2842912674},{"key-phrase":"forecasting morning","score":0.2297797352},{"key-phrase":"GCNN","score":0.2051479667},{"key-phrase":"mechanical learning","score":0.1762174666},{"key-phrase":"intelligent","score":0.1744249314},{"key-phrase":"such problem","score":0.1155889481},{"key-phrase":"good implementation prospect","score":0.1100082025},{"key-phrase":"rich and valuable knowledge","score":0.1075262129},{"key-phrase":"extensive application","score":0.0948880389},{"key-phrase":"fault tolerance","score":0.0849637538},{"key-phrase":"related concept","score":0.0793834329},{"key-phrase":"other hidden feature","score":0.0731205791},{"key-phrase":"random section","score":0.0722272024},{"key-phrase":"great significance","score":0.067839168},{"key-phrase":"other model","score":0.0609330758},{"key-phrase":"experimental result","score":0.0303205065},{"key-phrase":"academic value","score":0.0020350856}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":156,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Human Origin-Destination Flow Prediction Based on Large Scale Mobile Signal Data","Abstract":"The human origin-destination (OD) flow prediction is of great significance for urban safety control, stampede prevention, disease transmission control, urban planning, and many other aspects. Most of the existing methods generally divide the urban area into grids and use vehicle GPS trajectories and metrocard check-in data, combined with machine learning or deep learning models to predict human OD flow. However, these kinds of methods are challenging to capture fine-grained human mobility patterns. Moreover, these methods usually deviate from the actual human OD transfer patterns on a citywide scale due to the particularity of different datasets. To this end, in this paper, we use large-scale mobile phone signal data to achieve human OD flow prediction between the coverage of varying signal base stations. Many signal base stations are distributed in urban geographical space, collecting all the mobile phone user's location information to obtain large-scale fine-grained unbiased human OD flow data. Due to the lack of natural topology structure between base stations, this paper adopts a TGCN model combined with a graph fusion module to pretrain the dynamic population distribution prediction task. The parameters of the graph fusion module are employed to capture the different semantic information in the proposed hybrid machine learning method and finally achieve citywide human OD flow prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world signal datasets in Changchun, China, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. \u00a9 2021 Qiuyang Huang et al.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Huang Q., Yang Y., Xu Y., Wang E., Zhu K.","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/1604268","x":5.23,"y":-2.53,"KeyPhrases":["fine-grained human mobility pattern","hybrid machine learning","flow prediction","urban safety control","graph fusion module"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"fine-grained human mobility pattern","score":0.5147576332},{"key-phrase":"citywide human OD flow","score":0.4996060729},{"key-phrase":"flow prediction","score":0.4529500604},{"key-phrase":"urban safety control","score":0.3853909075},{"key-phrase":"deep learning model","score":0.3559830487},{"key-phrase":"urban geographical space","score":0.3292153776},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3160061836},{"key-phrase":"graph fusion module","score":0.3118492365},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3002083898},{"key-phrase":"vehicle GPS trajectory","score":0.2847371697},{"key-phrase":"unbiased human OD flow","score":0.2837040126},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2827500999},{"key-phrase":"hybrid machine learning","score":0.2806002498},{"key-phrase":"dynamic population distribution","score":0.2673496604},{"key-phrase":"citywide scale","score":0.2649687827},{"key-phrase":"prediction task","score":0.2638936341},{"key-phrase":"stampede prevention","score":0.2595018446},{"key-phrase":"large-scale mobile phone signal","score":0.2506665587},{"key-phrase":"TGCN model","score":0.23894988},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone user's","score":0.2304301858},{"key-phrase":"human OD flow","score":0.2256427407},{"key-phrase":"flow","score":0.2037928104},{"key-phrase":"different datasets","score":0.1989422441},{"key-phrase":"disease transmission control","score":0.1879930198},{"key-phrase":"location information","score":0.1771664321},{"key-phrase":"different semantic information","score":0.1624556184},{"key-phrase":"metrocard check","score":0.1608765125},{"key-phrase":"actual human OD transfer","score":0.1597816348},{"key-phrase":"real-world signal","score":0.1480978131},{"key-phrase":"Many signal base","score":0.136444509},{"key-phrase":"natural topology structure","score":0.1294489205},{"key-phrase":"base station","score":0.1108701527},{"key-phrase":"human origin","score":0.0967241228},{"key-phrase":"signal base station","score":0.0840263143},{"key-phrase":"OD","score":0.0416673608},{"key-phrase":"many other aspect","score":0.0365407765},{"key-phrase":"great significance","score":0.0342896767},{"key-phrase":"Extensive experiment","score":0.0142253693}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":157,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"From sonic experiences to urban planning innovations","Abstract":"It is widely accepted that personal responses to soundscapes are more dependent on listeners\u2019 emotions and attitudes, than on sounds or their physical features alone. Fast-growing cities have catalyzed the importance of designing urban spaces that citizens find pleasant and homely and that support a communal style of living. Unfortunately, there are no standardized methods or techniques to translate sonic experiences into measurable and reliable data, which urban planning professionals or the building industry could turn into innovations and solutions. Most of the data pertaining to noise pollution and city soundscapes is still based on predictive acoustic models and rarely takes any real-life experiences or physical measurements into consideration. This paper presents the concept of a smart and participatory approach for gathering sonic experiences that could be translated into measurable values. The aim is to search for data collection methods to provide data to train deep learning. With machine learning methods, it is possible to find patterns in both desirable and undesirable urban soundscapes.

This study identified areas that are likely to be damaged by landslides and aimed to predict future landslides. We compared and analyzed areas using machine learning (ML) algorithms, and conducted susceptibility mapping and landslide prediction using an algorithm that produced excellent results. For landslide predictions, the probability distribution of precipitation in the representative concentration pathway scenario 8.5 was used. We accounted for future uncertainties by using several regional climate model scenarios. Comparing the performances of different ML algorithms, the overall prediction accuracy of the random forest (0.932) was excellent. Susceptibility to landslides in the future determined using the random forest and five other regional climate models exhibited minor differences, but the average susceptibility increased over time. In addition, many urban areas are distributed around forest areas that have high landslide vulnerabilities, which provide important perspectives for urban and environmental planning. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

Urban planners and designers must develop urban forms that address these challenges. With the integration of new communication and information technologies (Smartphone, GIS, Drones, IoT, Sensors, etc.), urban activities have generated large volumes of urban data. The rapid growth in terms of collection and big data storage capacities combined with the ever-increasing computational power of modern machines have made possible their efficient treatment using machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The emergence of such groundbreaking methods has in turn helped to address the challenges of modern-day cities in several domains (health, security, mobility, etc). ML algorithms have been proposed to model the urban form's indicators for intelligent urban planning decision making. They have been proven to perform better than the traditional methods. However, the potential of ML has not yet been fully explored in research for urban planning decision support. This paper presents a comprehensive review of ML applications for mitigating the challenges of modern cities planning. First and foremost, an overview of the urban forms, sources of urban data, the ML and DL techniques as well as their potential in solving the aforementioned challenges. For each ML method, we will highlight it working principle, advantages, disadvantages and potential applications using comparative tables. Finally, we will discuss the issues and challenges of ML methods in urban form's modeling while ultimately advocating some future research directions. \u00a9 2021","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Ensemble methods; Machine learning; Neural networks; Urban big data; Urban data; Urban form; Urban models; Urban planning","Authors":"Koumetio Tekouabou S.C., Diop E.B., Azmi R., Jaligot R., Chenal J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jksuci.2021.08.007","x":5.2600002289,"y":5.7600002289,"KeyPhrases":["intelligent urban planning decision","deep learning","urban data","urban form's modeling","several domain"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"intelligent urban planning decision","score":0.6488826275},{"key-phrase":"urban form's modeling","score":0.5570150614},{"key-phrase":"urban data","score":0.5390954018},{"key-phrase":"urban planning decision","score":0.5187548399},{"key-phrase":"modern city planning","score":0.4947629869},{"key-phrase":"urban form","score":0.4910219908},{"key-phrase":"Urban planner","score":0.4842821956},{"key-phrase":"urban form's indicator","score":0.4524106979},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.4396781325},{"key-phrase":"modern-day city","score":0.4278512299},{"key-phrase":"Modern city","score":0.4099869728},{"key-phrase":"urban activity","score":0.4096684158},{"key-phrase":"ML algorithm","score":0.3844125867},{"key-phrase":"ML application","score":0.361238718},{"key-phrase":"ML method","score":0.329149425},{"key-phrase":"ML","score":0.3048402965},{"key-phrase":"big data storage","score":0.2298673391},{"key-phrase":"computational power","score":0.1782051027},{"key-phrase":"modern machine","score":0.1750935465},{"key-phrase":"information technology","score":0.1743892282},{"key-phrase":"potential application","score":0.1518934369},{"key-phrase":"modern","score":0.1327572465},{"key-phrase":"large volume","score":0.1303021014},{"key-phrase":"rapid growth","score":0.1171065569},{"key-phrase":"several challenge","score":0.1004295051},{"key-phrase":"economic development","score":0.0990085751},{"key-phrase":"several domain","score":0.092378974},{"key-phrase":"DL technique","score":0.0836810172},{"key-phrase":"future research direction","score":0.0784476325},{"key-phrase":"such groundbreaking method","score":0.0723023266},{"key-phrase":"new communication","score":0.0425730422},{"key-phrase":"aforementioned challenge","score":0.020187635},{"key-phrase":"comparative table","score":0.0153326336},{"key-phrase":"efficient treatment","score":0.0116199143},{"key-phrase":"traditional method","score":0.0085056014},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive review","score":-0.0120048411}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":161,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Scale-Robust Deep-Supervision Network for Mapping Building Footprints from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images","Abstract":"Building footprint information is one of the key factors for sustainable urban planning and environmental monitoring. Mapping building footprints from remote sensing images is an important and challenging task in the earth observation field. Over the years, convolutional neural networks have shown outstanding improvements in the building extraction field due to their ability to automatically extract hierarchical features and make building predictions. However, as buildings are various in different sizes, scenes, and roofing materials, it is hard to precisely depict buildings of varied sizes, especially in large areas (e.g., nationwide). To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel deep-supervision convolutional neural network (denoted as DS-Net) for extracting building footprints from high-resolution remote sensing images. In the proposed network, we applied deep supervision with an extra lightweight encoder, which enables the network to learn representative building features of different scales. Furthermore, a scale attention module is designed to aggregate multiscale features and generate the final building prediction. Experiments on two publicly available building datasets, including the WHU Building Dataset and the Massachusetts Building Dataset, show the effectiveness of the proposed method. With only a 0.22-M increment of parameters compared with U-Net, the proposed DS-Net achieved an IoU of 90.4% on the WHU Building Dataset and 73.8% on the Massachusetts Dataset.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and small-sensor technology are rapidly evolving, presenting the opportunity for a comprehensive multi-sensor remote sensing approach for urban tree classification. The objectives of this paper were to develop a multi-sensor data fusion technique for urban tree species classification with limited training samples. To that end, UAV-based multispectral, hyperspectral, LiDAR, and thermal infrared imagery was collected over an urban study area to test the classification of 96 individual trees from seven species using a data fusion approach. Two supervised machine learning classifiers, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were investigated for their capacity to incorporate highly dimensional and diverse datasets from multiple sensors. When using hyperspectral-derived spectral features with RF, the fusion of all features extracted from all sensor types (spectral, LiDAR, thermal) achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (OA) of 83.3% and kappa of 0.80. Despite multispectral reflectance bands alone producing significantly lower OA of 55.2% compared to 70.2% with minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformed hyperspectral reflectance bands, the full dataset combination (spectral, LiDAR, thermal) with multispectral-derived spectral features achieved an OA of 81.3% and kappa of 0.77 using RF. Comparison of the features extracted from individual sensors for each species highlight the ability for each sensor to identify distinguishable characteristics between species to aid classification. The results demonstrate the potential for a high-resolution multi-sensor data fusion approach for classifying individual trees by species in a complex urban environment under limited sampling requirements. \u00a9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"Random Forest; Remote Sensing; Support Vector Machine; Tree Species Detection","Authors":"Hartling S., Sagan V., Maimaitijiang M.","DOI":"10.1080\/15481603.2021.1974275","x":9.66,"y":-4.68,"KeyPhrases":["urban tree classification","multispectral-derived spectral feature","Unmanned aerial vehicle","multi-sensor data fusion","Support Vector Machine"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban tree classification","score":0.6280223727},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.5447106361},{"key-phrase":"Urban tree specie","score":0.5092760324},{"key-phrase":"multispectral-derived spectral feature","score":0.4786323011},{"key-phrase":"thermal infrared imagery","score":0.4057199955},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution multi-sensor data fusion","score":0.401127398},{"key-phrase":"multi-sensor data fusion","score":0.3864955008},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machine","score":0.3780940771},{"key-phrase":"machine learning classifier","score":0.3767986298},{"key-phrase":"multispectral reflectance band","score":0.3702376187},{"key-phrase":"hyperspectral reflectance band","score":0.3668212593},{"key-phrase":"complex urban environment","score":0.3579849601},{"key-phrase":"spectral feature","score":0.3510611355},{"key-phrase":"spectral and spatial diversity","score":0.328740567},{"key-phrase":"individual tree","score":0.3195612133},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3164793551},{"key-phrase":"Unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.3028621078},{"key-phrase":"data fusion approach","score":0.3017690182},{"key-phrase":"overall classification accuracy","score":0.3004549742},{"key-phrase":"multiple sensor","score":0.2623793483},{"key-phrase":"dimensional and diverse datasets","score":0.2622551322},{"key-phrase":"full dataset combination","score":0.2375745624},{"key-phrase":"individual sensor","score":0.2306275517},{"key-phrase":"urban study area","score":0.2293290794},{"key-phrase":"sensor type","score":0.2254996002},{"key-phrase":"spectral","score":0.1716004312},{"key-phrase":"limited training sample","score":0.1479498297},{"key-phrase":"specie","score":0.1345318705},{"key-phrase":"small-sensor technology","score":0.125499025},{"key-phrase":"minimum noise fraction","score":0.0781113058},{"key-phrase":"challenging task","score":0.0300602652},{"key-phrase":"limited sampling requirement","score":0.028726995}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":163,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Transfer learning-based city similarity measurement: A case study on urban hotel","Abstract":"With the development of modern cities, multiple types and wide distribution of urban data has been gradually collected.

Planning Support Systems (PSS) enable climate-informed planning. However, previous research confirms difficulties in the uptake of PSS due to their resource-intensive nature and lack of awareness of their usefulness. This chapter aims to make a headway in understanding research priorities and gaps that need to be addressed for PSS to address climate resilience in the long run. To this end, we review the emerging body of knowledge in academia and practice, by conducting a text-mining analysis of academic (n = 36,405) and non-academic (practice) (n = 86) literature on urban planning and climate resilience. We extract trends on climate pressures, infrastructure drivers, and planning responses. A key finding from academic literature is that long-term planning continues to be limited to a few fixed scenarios and places a strong focus on single sector strategies. Practice documents continue to be designed to inform high-level policies, but not spatial plans that require integrated thinking. Our analysis concludes with a research agenda for improving PSS to (1) identify and integrate the full range of variables in the long-term; (2) support selection of appropriate planning responses across multiple infrastructure systems; and (3) improve flexibility in planning by a deeper understanding of temporal aspects such as planning timeframes. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Academic publishing; Literature review; Long-term planning; Machine learning; Planning support systems; Topic modeling; Uncertainty; Urban climate adaptation; Urban knowledge systems; Urban resilience","Authors":"Krishnan S., Aydin N.Y., Comes T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-76059-5_24","x":4.7800002098,"y":3.8399999142,"KeyPhrases":["urban resilience","climate pressure","spatial plan","understanding research priority","climate resilience"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban resilience","score":0.6075835824},{"key-phrase":"climate resilience","score":0.6039191484},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5261137486},{"key-phrase":"long-term planning","score":0.4343196452},{"key-phrase":"appropriate planning response","score":0.3487697542},{"key-phrase":"climate change","score":0.3470218182},{"key-phrase":"spatial plan","score":0.3359908462},{"key-phrase":"climate pressure","score":0.3274021745},{"key-phrase":"resilience","score":0.2946739495},{"key-phrase":"high-level policy","score":0.2485895753},{"key-phrase":"multiple infrastructure system","score":0.2474798262},{"key-phrase":"infrastructure driver","score":0.2416891754},{"key-phrase":"Support Systems","score":0.2263779193},{"key-phrase":"single sector strategy","score":0.2034497112},{"key-phrase":"research agenda","score":0.1904148608},{"key-phrase":"understanding research priority","score":0.1617418081},{"key-phrase":"integrated thinking","score":0.154424727},{"key-phrase":"intensive nature","score":0.1425202191},{"key-phrase":"support selection","score":0.1192929298},{"key-phrase":"academic literature","score":0.1159904897},{"key-phrase":"previous research","score":0.1147723645},{"key-phrase":"mining analysis","score":0.0970765129},{"key-phrase":"temporal aspect","score":0.0938757956},{"key-phrase":"PSS","score":0.0779499561},{"key-phrase":"long run","score":0.0767765492},{"key-phrase":"full range","score":-0.0163638592},{"key-phrase":"key finding","score":-0.0197315365},{"key-phrase":"strong focus","score":-0.0450753346}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":167,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Detection of Urban Built-Up Area Change from Sentinel-2 Images Using Multiband Temporal Texture and One-Class Random Forest","Abstract":"Detection of urban land expansion is important for understanding the urbanization process and improving urban planning. Spatio-temporal contextual information derived from multitemporal high-resolution imagery is useful for highlighting urban land cover changes. This article proposes a new method for detecting urban built-up area change from multitemporal high spatial resolution imagery by combining spectral and spatio-temporal features. A multiband temporal texture measured using pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV) is adopted to quantify the local spatio-temporal dependence between bitemporal multispectral images. The PCMV textures at multiple scales, bitemporal spectral features, and normalized difference vegetation indices are together input to an improved one-class random forest classifier for urban built-up area change mapping. The proposed method is evaluated in urban built-up area change detection using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images of Tianjin area acquired from 2015 to 2019. It is also compared with three feature combinations and an existing postclassification comparison method based on one-class support vector machine. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed the traditional ones, with increases of 2.15%-7.38%, 2.07%-5.45%, 1.93%-6.76%, and 5.98%-13.11% in overall accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method also achieves the best performance using the bitemporal Sentinel-2 images over the east of Beijing area. The proposed method is promising as a simple and reliable way to detect urban built-up area change with multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Built-up area change; improved one-class random forest (iOCRF); multiband temporal texture; multitemporal data; pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV)","Authors":"Feng X., Li P., Cheng T.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2021.3092064","x":9.85,"y":-4.38,"KeyPhrases":["urban land cover","random forest classifier","multiband temporal texture","difference vegetation index","Spatio-temporal contextual information"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land cover","score":0.550966084},{"key-phrase":"urban land expansion","score":0.4660983682},{"key-phrase":"random forest classifier","score":0.4298956096},{"key-phrase":"difference vegetation index","score":0.3814560175},{"key-phrase":"urbanization process","score":0.3680676222},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3677330017},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal feature","score":0.3635008335},{"key-phrase":"high spatial resolution imagery","score":0.3376873136},{"key-phrase":"class support vector","score":0.3113024235},{"key-phrase":"bitemporal multispectral image","score":0.305113554},{"key-phrase":"multitemporal Sentinel","score":0.2793602943},{"key-phrase":"Spatio-temporal contextual information","score":0.2773397565},{"key-phrase":"postclassification comparison method","score":0.27292943},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution imagery","score":0.268435061},{"key-phrase":"area change","score":0.265435636},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal dependence","score":0.2553000748},{"key-phrase":"multiband temporal texture","score":0.2411056459},{"key-phrase":"multivariate variogram","score":0.2373030335},{"key-phrase":"bitemporal spectral feature","score":0.2298567146},{"key-phrase":"PCMV texture","score":0.2288991511},{"key-phrase":"multitemporal","score":0.1782106906},{"key-phrase":"Tianjin area","score":0.1723587662},{"key-phrase":"feature combination","score":0.1690053344},{"key-phrase":"Beijing area","score":0.1677205116},{"key-phrase":"new method","score":0.1120958626},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1038038209},{"key-phrase":"multiple scale","score":0.100024581},{"key-phrase":"bitemporal Sentinel","score":0.0992715582},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0529409498},{"key-phrase":"simple and reliable way","score":0.0275011007},{"key-phrase":"bitemporal","score":0.0206141882},{"key-phrase":"pseudo cross","score":0.0031068204},{"key-phrase":"Experimental result","score":-0.0134061351}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":168,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"An Intelligent Tree Planning Approach Using Location-Based Social Networks\u00a0Data","Abstract":"How do we make sure that all citizens in a city have access to enough green space? An increasing part of the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas, where contact with nature is largely reduced to street trees and parks. As optional tree planting sites and financial resources are limited, determining the best planting site can be formulated as an optimization problem with constraints. Can we locate these sites based on the popularity of nearby venues? How can we ensure that we include groups of people who tend to spend time in tree deprived areas? Currently, tree location sites are chosen based on criteria from spatial-visual, physical and biological, and functional categories. As these criteria do not give any insights into which citizens are benefiting from the tree placement, we propose new data-driven tree planting policies that take socio-cultural aspects as represented by the citizens\u2019 behavior into account. We combine a Location Based Social Network (LBSN) mobility data set with tree location data sets, both of New York City and Paris, as a case study. The effect of four different policies is evaluated on simulated movement data and assessed on the average, overall exposure to trees as well as on how much inequality in tree exposure is mitigated. \u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Community detection algorithms; Mobility data; Multi-objective optimization; Social network analysis; Tree planning; Urban computing","Authors":"van Staalduinen J.H., Tetteroo J., Gawehns D., Baratchi M.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-76640-5_10","x":-5.5100002289,"y":6.9400000572,"KeyPhrases":["tree planting policy","mobility data","urban area","tree location data","Social Network"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"tree planting policy","score":0.4984073639},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4675723314},{"key-phrase":"optional tree planting","score":0.4431224763},{"key-phrase":"tree location data","score":0.4395938814},{"key-phrase":"tree placement","score":0.4309000373},{"key-phrase":"street tree","score":0.426271379},{"key-phrase":"tree location site","score":0.3868822157},{"key-phrase":"enough green space","score":0.3667645454},{"key-phrase":"tree exposure","score":0.3609599769},{"key-phrase":"mobility data","score":0.3569425046},{"key-phrase":"tree","score":0.3325666189},{"key-phrase":"Social Network","score":0.3255854845},{"key-phrase":"planting site","score":0.3125907779},{"key-phrase":"planting","score":0.2708677053},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.2604523897},{"key-phrase":"population life","score":0.2577851415},{"key-phrase":"simulated movement data","score":0.1883700788},{"key-phrase":"much inequality","score":0.1824268103},{"key-phrase":"nearby venue","score":0.1794413328},{"key-phrase":"overall exposure","score":0.1591737419},{"key-phrase":"optimization problem","score":0.1536484063},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1423812807},{"key-phrase":"cultural aspect","score":0.1415128559},{"key-phrase":"functional category","score":0.1342997253},{"key-phrase":"different policy","score":0.1291403919},{"key-phrase":"new data","score":0.1194621474},{"key-phrase":"financial resource","score":0.0928718448}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":169,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Satellite derived bathymetry using deep learning","Abstract":"Coastal development and urban planning are facing different issues including natural disasters and extreme storm events. The ability to track and forecast the evolution of the physical characteristics of coastal areas over time is an important factor in coastal development, risk mitigation and overall coastal zone management. Traditional bathymetry measurements are obtained using echo-sounding techniques which are considered expensive and not always possible due to various complexities. Remote sensing tools such as satellite imagery can be used to estimate bathymetry using incident wave signatures and inversion models such as physical models of waves. In this work, we present two novel approaches to bathymetry estimation using deep learning and we compare the two proposed methods in terms of accuracy, computational costs, and applicability to real data. We show that deep learning is capable of accurately estimating ocean depth in a variety of simulated cases which offers a new approach for bathymetry estimation and a novel application for deep learning. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Earth observation; Machine learning; Regression; Satellite-derived bathymetry","Authors":"Al Najar M., Thoumyre G., Bergsma E.W.J., Almar R., Benshila R., Wilson D.G.","DOI":"10.1007\/s10994-021-05977-w","x":9.26,"y":-5.6,"KeyPhrases":["bathymetry estimation","deep learning","incident wave signature","satellite imagery","Coastal development"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"bathymetry estimation","score":0.5476105809},{"key-phrase":"bathymetry","score":0.4913676381},{"key-phrase":"ocean depth","score":0.4598091245},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.4596309066},{"key-phrase":"Traditional bathymetry measurement","score":0.4562219977},{"key-phrase":"Coastal development","score":0.4343703985},{"key-phrase":"overall coastal zone management","score":0.3843250871},{"key-phrase":"coastal area","score":0.3588565886},{"key-phrase":"satellite imagery","score":0.3266697526},{"key-phrase":"coastal","score":0.2959971726},{"key-phrase":"incident wave signature","score":0.2394898385},{"key-phrase":"real data","score":0.2175749838},{"key-phrase":"inversion model","score":0.2140910327},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.1959628463},{"key-phrase":"extreme storm event","score":0.1394671649},{"key-phrase":"physical model","score":0.131253019},{"key-phrase":"natural disaster","score":0.1023103893},{"key-phrase":"computational cost","score":0.0955594182},{"key-phrase":"novel application","score":0.0865700394},{"key-phrase":"various complexity","score":0.0766943842},{"key-phrase":"risk mitigation","score":0.0762922019},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.063185133},{"key-phrase":"physical characteristic","score":0.0611727796},{"key-phrase":"novel approach","score":0.0554357208},{"key-phrase":"new approach","score":0.0408260822},{"key-phrase":"important factor","score":0.0168218948},{"key-phrase":"different issue","score":0.0043482659}]},{"Cluster":9,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":170,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Evolution of historical urban landscape with computer vision and machine learning: A case study of Berlin","Abstract":"Previous studies of historical urban landscape usually focused on the qualitative analysis of city planning and development with the social, economic, and political context, but overlooked quantitative analysis from human perceptions. In this study, we objectively measured the seemingly subjective qualities of the eye-level urban landscape perceptions with computer vision and machine learning technologies. We then explored correlations between the measured perceptual qualities and characteristics from the historical context. We chose Berlin as a research object because it is a capital city that owns a rich history of division and reunification, as well as a variety of residential zones built at different periods. We extracted 30 street features from the 150,000 Google Street View Imagery (SVI) dataset with a computer vision algorithm and evaluated eight perceptual qualities including typology, order, ecology, enclosure, aesthetics, richness, accessibility and scale with a machine learning method. Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning policies in streetscape improvement. \u00a9 Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH \u00b7.","Author Keywords":"Computer vision; Google street view image; Machine learning; Perceptual qualities","Authors":"Tian H., Han Z., Xu W., Liu X., Qiu W., Li W.","DOI":"10.14627\/537705039","x":7.59,"y":-4.38,"KeyPhrases":["urban landscape perception","machine learning technology","berlin","construction period","housing policy"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban landscape perception","score":0.7080190182},{"key-phrase":"historical urban landscape","score":0.6757823229},{"key-phrase":"urban design","score":0.6235849857},{"key-phrase":"streetscape improvement","score":0.5848674178},{"key-phrase":"city planning","score":0.520234704},{"key-phrase":"Google Street View","score":0.4821972251},{"key-phrase":"environment perception","score":0.4655990005},{"key-phrase":"other urban planning policy","score":0.4379698336},{"key-phrase":"residential district","score":0.3841619194},{"key-phrase":"human perception","score":0.3795821667},{"key-phrase":"perceptual quality","score":0.3784824014},{"key-phrase":"subjective human perception measure","score":0.3746023178},{"key-phrase":"residential zone","score":0.3613325059},{"key-phrase":"computer vision","score":0.3304368258},{"key-phrase":"berlin","score":0.3178579211},{"key-phrase":"computer vision algorithm","score":0.3131252229},{"key-phrase":"street feature","score":0.2981559038},{"key-phrase":"housing policy","score":0.2977404892},{"key-phrase":"ecological environment","score":0.2895034552},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technology","score":0.2858630717},{"key-phrase":"subjective quality","score":0.2836192846},{"key-phrase":"perceptual","score":0.2794552147},{"key-phrase":"open space","score":0.2778588235},{"key-phrase":"other city","score":0.2535921335},{"key-phrase":"planning policy","score":0.2504275739},{"key-phrase":"capital city","score":0.248886317},{"key-phrase":"subjective measure","score":0.2439747155},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.2423950881},{"key-phrase":"design code","score":0.2275685817},{"key-phrase":"rich history","score":0.2253709882},{"key-phrase":"construction period","score":0.21978423},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.2182743698},{"key-phrase":"economic and political contexts","score":0.20600079},{"key-phrase":"qualitative analysis","score":0.2019337416},{"key-phrase":"quantitative framework","score":0.1841456145},{"key-phrase":"quantitative analysis","score":0.1838861704},{"key-phrase":"systematic comparison","score":0.17986992},{"key-phrase":"historical context","score":0.1631843001},{"key-phrase":"political context","score":0.1376222074},{"key-phrase":"Previous study","score":0.0826348215},{"key-phrase":"research object","score":0.0618371665},{"key-phrase":"different period","score":0.015578866},{"key-phrase":"high-throughput and scalable framework","score":0.0032440294},{"key-phrase":"great testimony","score":-0.0103878658}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":171,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Object-Oriented Approach for Urbanization Growth by Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques: A Case Study in Hilla City, Babylon Governorate, Iraq","Abstract":"High rate of urbanization coupled with population growth has led to unexpected land use and land cover changes in Hilla city, which is located in the Babylon governorate of Iraq. Understanding and quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban land use and land cover changes, as well as the driving factors behind them, are therefore vital in order to design appropriate policies and monitoring mechanisms to govern urban growth. This study analyzes land use and land cover changes over Hilla city through remote sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques. IKONOS satellite imagery from years 2000, 2005, and 2011 was collected and pre-processed using ENVI and ArcGIS, which then goes through an object-based supervised image classification stage to generate land use and land cover maps. The classification is performed using the statistical machine learning algorithm, SVM (Support Vector Machine). The confusion matrix and kappa coefficients are used to evaluate the overall accuracy of the results. The statistical results obtained enable assessment of class changes from years 2000 to 2011 and also identify the gain and loss of the built-up areas in relation to other land cover classes. The results also allow assessment of the spatial trend of these built-up areas. Ultimately, forecasts can be made to predict expected future class changes in 2026 and 2036. Generally, the results of this study show increased expansions of built-up areas, i.e., from 8.14% in 2000 to 14.53% in 2005 and up to 18.36% in 2011. All this was at the expense of bare land areas. Simultaneously, there was an increased expansion of vegetation\/agricultural land area, specifically from 36.14% in 2000 to 41.71% in 2005 and 45.13% in 2011. The spatial trend also shows that the growth of built-up areas is focused in the southwestern part of Hilla city. In all, we foresee that the findings of this study can provide a good visual resource for decision-makers to perform more efficient urban planning. \u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Built-up areas; Land use dynamics; Spatial trend; Support vector machine; Urbanization","Authors":"Mahmoud A.S., Kalantar B., Al-Najjar H.A.H., Moayedi H., Halin A.A., Mansor S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-71945-6_3","x":9.51,"y":-3.78,"KeyPhrases":["urban land use","Support Vector Machine","IKONOS satellite imagery","land cover change","statistical result"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land use","score":0.5960714817},{"key-phrase":"land cover change","score":0.5543425083},{"key-phrase":"land cover map","score":0.524463892},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.4923933446},{"key-phrase":"agricultural land area","score":0.4882690907},{"key-phrase":"other land cover","score":0.4795533717},{"key-phrase":"urban growth","score":0.4775009751},{"key-phrase":"unexpected land use","score":0.4402914941},{"key-phrase":"Geographical Information System","score":0.4036981463},{"key-phrase":"bare land area","score":0.3992809653},{"key-phrase":"spatial trend","score":0.3883878589},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machine","score":0.376273334},{"key-phrase":"efficient urban planning","score":0.3743769825},{"key-phrase":"supervised image classification","score":0.3703323603},{"key-phrase":"land","score":0.3286038041},{"key-phrase":"population growth","score":0.307544589},{"key-phrase":"IKONOS satellite imagery","score":0.3073577285},{"key-phrase":"Babylon governorate","score":0.2646434903},{"key-phrase":"Hilla city","score":0.2310978174},{"key-phrase":"statistical machine","score":0.2196701914},{"key-phrase":"class change","score":0.2129475772},{"key-phrase":"statistical result","score":0.2117229551},{"key-phrase":"future class change","score":0.1950993091},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal dynamic","score":0.174583748},{"key-phrase":"good visual resource","score":0.1717209518},{"key-phrase":"kappa coefficient","score":0.1696021259},{"key-phrase":"confusion matrix","score":0.1693537831},{"key-phrase":"hilla","score":0.1671952754},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1379944682},{"key-phrase":"southwestern part","score":0.088148579},{"key-phrase":"High rate","score":0.0782759711},{"key-phrase":"monitoring mechanism","score":0.0550584532},{"key-phrase":"appropriate policy","score":0.0354775004}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":172,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Mapping essential urban land use categories (EULUC) using geospatial big data: Progress, challenges, and opportunities","Abstract":"Urban land use information that reflects socio-economic functions and human activities is critically essential for urban planning, landscape design, environmental management, health promotion, and biodiversity conservation. Land-use maps outlining the distribution, pattern, and composition of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) have facilitated a wide spectrum of applications and further triggered new opportunities in urban studies. New and improved Earth observations, algorithms, and advanced products for extracting thematic urban information, in association with emerging social sensing big data and auxiliary crowdsourcing datasets, all together offer great potentials to mapping fine-resolution EULUC from regional to global scales. Here we review the advances of EULUC mapping research and practices in terms of their data, methods, and applications. Based on the historical retrospect, we summarize the challenges and limitations of current EULUC studies regarding sample collection, mixed land use problem, data and model generalization, and large-scale mapping efforts.

Model performance can be improved by integrating exogenous features from open data repositories (e.g., weather, housing prices, traffic, etc.), but these uncurated sources are often too noisy, incomplete, and biased to use directly. We propose to learn integrated representations, called EquiTensors, from heterogeneous datasets that can be reused across a variety of tasks. We align datasets to a consistent spatio-temporal domain, then describe an unsupervised model based on convolutional denoising autoencoders to learn shared representations. We extend this core integrative model with adaptive weighting to prevent certain datasets from dominating the signal. To combat discriminatory bias, we use adversarial learning to remove correlations with a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or income). Experiments with 23 input datasets and 4 real applications show that EquiTensors could help mitigate the effects of the sensitive information embodied in the biased data. Meanwhile, applications using EquiTensors outperform models that ignore exogenous features and are competitive with \"oracle\"models that use hand-selected datasets. \u00a9 2021 ACM.","Author Keywords":"data integration; fairness in machine learning; neural networks; open data; spatial-temporal predictions","Authors":"Yan A., Howe B.","DOI":"10.1145\/3448016.3452777","x":4.3800001144,"y":3.3499999046,"KeyPhrases":["urban prediction problem","convolutional denoising autoencoders","sensitive attribute","heterogeneous datasets","accident risk"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban prediction problem","score":0.509757638},{"key-phrase":"convolutional denoising autoencoders","score":0.4861439466},{"key-phrase":"biased data","score":0.3621177673},{"key-phrase":"adversarial learning","score":0.3488819897},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous datasets","score":0.3420031667},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised model","score":0.336094141},{"key-phrase":"input datasets","score":0.3326096237},{"key-phrase":"exogenous feature","score":0.2671768069},{"key-phrase":"certain datasets","score":0.261890173},{"key-phrase":"Neural method","score":0.2555325329},{"key-phrase":"transportation resource demand","score":0.2433969378},{"key-phrase":"adaptive weighting","score":0.2211814821},{"key-phrase":"discriminatory bias","score":0.2200208604},{"key-phrase":"sensitive attribute","score":0.2107504606},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal domain","score":0.2086206973},{"key-phrase":"integrative model","score":0.2069290578},{"key-phrase":"accident risk","score":0.1971987486},{"key-phrase":"crowd mobility","score":0.1886562705},{"key-phrase":"uncurated source","score":0.1749071777},{"key-phrase":"public safety","score":0.1675262749},{"key-phrase":"sensitive information","score":0.1572842896},{"key-phrase":"Model performance","score":0.1243227869},{"key-phrase":"exogenous","score":0.1235455051},{"key-phrase":"open data repository","score":0.1149377376},{"key-phrase":"equitensors","score":0.1013381109},{"key-phrase":"housing price","score":0.0970428288},{"key-phrase":"real application show","score":0.0690355152}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":175,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Analysis of built-up areas of small polish cities with the use of deep learning and geographically weighted regression","Abstract":"Small cities are an important part of the settlement system, a link between rural areas and large cities. Although they perform important functions, research focuses on large cities and metropolises while marginalizing small cities, the study of which is of great importance to progress in social sciences, geography, and urban planning. The main goal of this paper was to verify the impact of selected socio-economic factors on the share of built-up areas in 665 small Polish cities in 2019. Data from the Database of Topographic Objects (BDOT), Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from 2015 and 2019, and Local Data Bank by Statistics Poland form 2019 were used in the research. A machine learning segmentation procedure was used to obtain the data on the occurrence of built-up areas. Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explain spatially varying impact of factors related to population, spatial and economic development, and living standards on the share of built-up areas in the area of small cities. Significant association was found between the population density and the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities studied. The influence of the other socio-economic factors examined, related to the spatial and economic development of the cities and the quality of life of the inhabitants, showed great regional variation. The results also indicated that the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities under study is a result of the conditions under which they were established and developed throughout their existence, and not only of the socio-economic factors affecting them at present. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The model was tested in Amol City, Iran, a data-scarce city in an ungauged area which is prone to severe flood inundation events and currently lacks flood prevention infrastructure. Performance of the hybridized model was compared with that of a standalone MLPNN model, random forest and boosted regression trees. Area under the curve, efficiency, true skill statistic, Matthews correlation coefficient, misclassification rate, sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate model performance. In validation, the MultiB-MLPNN model showed the best predictive performance. The hybridized MultiB-MLPNN model is thus useful for generating realistic flood susceptibility maps for data-scarce urban areas. The maps can be used to develop risk-reduction measures to protect urban areas from devastating floods, particularly where available data are insufficient to support physically based hydrological or hydraulic models. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

This coupling complicates urban planning and land use development, as changing one facet of the urban fabric will likely impact the others. As cities grapple with climate change, there is a growing need to envision urban futures that not only address more frequent and intense severe weather events but also improve day-to-day livability. Here we examine climate risks as functions of the local land use with numerical models. These models leverage a wide array of data sources, from satellite imagery to tax assessments and land cover. We then present a machine-learning cellular automata approach to combine historical land use change with local coproduced urban future scenarios. The cellular automata\u00a0model\u00a0uses historical and ancillary data like existing road systems and natural features to develop a set of probabilistic land use change rules, which are then modified according to stakeholder priorities. The resulting land use scenarios are evaluated against historical\u00a0flood\u00a0hazards, showcasing how they perform against stakeholder expectations. Our work shows that coproduced scenarios, when grounded with historical and emerging data, can provide paths that increase resilience to weather hazards as well as enhancing ecosystem services provided to citizens. \u00a9 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Author Keywords":"Climate vulnerability; Hazard; Land use\/cover change modeling; Mapping; Urban development scenarios","Authors":"Ortiz L., Mustafa A., Rosenzweig B., McPhearson T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-63131-4_9","x":13.1800003052,"y":0.5699999928,"KeyPhrases":["urban future scenario","cellular automata model","historical flood hazard","probabilistic land use","climate change"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban future scenario","score":0.5724954605},{"key-phrase":"probabilistic land use","score":0.5608995557},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5193549395},{"key-phrase":"land use scenario","score":0.4999624789},{"key-phrase":"urban future","score":0.4938103259},{"key-phrase":"cellular automata model","score":0.4614795148},{"key-phrase":"cellular automaton approach","score":0.4413510859},{"key-phrase":"land use development","score":0.4388971031},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.3958939016},{"key-phrase":"historical flood hazard","score":0.393455565},{"key-phrase":"climate risk","score":0.3872616887},{"key-phrase":"local land use","score":0.3732974529},{"key-phrase":"historical land use","score":0.3633257747},{"key-phrase":"day livability","score":0.3361290693},{"key-phrase":"climate change","score":0.3277872801},{"key-phrase":"road system","score":0.282736063},{"key-phrase":"weather hazard","score":0.2803781927},{"key-phrase":"satellite imagery","score":0.2775915861},{"key-phrase":"ecosystem service","score":0.2719869614},{"key-phrase":"intense severe weather event","score":0.2629460394},{"key-phrase":"urban fabric","score":0.2566969097},{"key-phrase":"numerical model","score":0.1949109733},{"key-phrase":"natural feature","score":0.1849543303},{"key-phrase":"complex system","score":0.1817531884},{"key-phrase":"tax assessment","score":0.1712975651},{"key-phrase":"stakeholder priority","score":0.1621415764},{"key-phrase":"technological process","score":0.1550110579},{"key-phrase":"historical and ancillary data","score":0.1547368467},{"key-phrase":"model leverage","score":0.1494601071},{"key-phrase":"change rule","score":0.129085958},{"key-phrase":"data source","score":0.1251424849},{"key-phrase":"stakeholder expectation","score":0.1038612872},{"key-phrase":"only address","score":0.0969993472},{"key-phrase":"historical","score":0.0486494638},{"key-phrase":"coproduced","score":0.0369890779},{"key-phrase":"wide array","score":-0.000006726}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":182,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Analyzing the spatiotemporal uncertainty in urbanization predictions","Abstract":"With the availability of computational resources, geographical information systems, and remote sensing data, urban growth modeling has become a viable tool for predicting urbanization of cities and towns, regions, and nations around the world. This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, urban growth models often discard the spatiotemporal uncertainties in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyzed the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on a widely applied cellular automata model known as the SLEUTH CA and the other one based on a previously published machine learning framework. We selected these two models because they are complementary, the first is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the second is more data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori knowledge or bias. To test our methodology, we chose the cities of Jiaxing and Lishui in China because they are representative of new town planning policies and have different characteristics in terms of land extension, geographical conditions, growth rates, and economic drivers. We focused on the spatiotemporal uncertainty, understood as the inherent doubt in the predictions of where and when will a piece of land become urban, using the concepts of certainty area in space and certainty area in time. The proposed analyses in this paper aim to contribute to better urban planning exercises, and they can be extended to other cities worldwide. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN-based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation. In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labeling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mean Intersection over Union of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pretrained model of UVid-Net on urban street scene by fine tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; semantic segmentation; transfer learning; U-Net; unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video","Authors":"Girisha S., Verma U., Manohara Pai M.M., Pai R.M.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2021.3069909","x":9.29,"y":-5.83,"KeyPhrases":["semantic segmentation method","UAV video","CNN architecture","environmental change","temporal information"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"semantic segmentation method","score":0.4959590733},{"key-phrase":"Semantic segmentation","score":0.4550801814},{"key-phrase":"UAV video","score":0.4484714866},{"key-phrase":"semantic segmentation algorithms","score":0.4453020096},{"key-phrase":"CNN architecture","score":0.4378413856},{"key-phrase":"aerial videos","score":0.4146178663},{"key-phrase":"unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.3798562884},{"key-phrase":"segmentation","score":0.3185111284},{"key-phrase":"optical flow","score":0.2665549517},{"key-phrase":"video","score":0.259991467},{"key-phrase":"temporal information","score":0.2592586279},{"key-phrase":"class label","score":0.2469559908},{"key-phrase":"consistent labeling","score":0.2157684565},{"key-phrase":"pretrained model","score":0.2063848078},{"key-phrase":"urban street scene","score":0.1909384131},{"key-phrase":"accurate localization","score":0.1835313141},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.176633358},{"key-phrase":"Net architecture","score":0.1745035201},{"key-phrase":"temporal dynamic","score":0.1732382774},{"key-phrase":"extended ManipalUAVid dataset","score":0.1442322135},{"key-phrase":"environmental change","score":0.143186897},{"key-phrase":"disaster management","score":0.1422727406},{"key-phrase":"art algorithms","score":0.1382664591},{"key-phrase":"final layer","score":0.1288084388},{"key-phrase":"refiner module","score":0.0901697651},{"key-phrase":"computational overhead","score":0.0804058015},{"key-phrase":"decision support system","score":0.0571901463},{"key-phrase":"fine tuning","score":0.039355237},{"key-phrase":"other state","score":0.0299998838},{"key-phrase":"metric mean Intersection","score":-0.0077595785},{"key-phrase":"research work","score":-0.0168506373},{"key-phrase":"additional module","score":-0.0190026406},{"key-phrase":"promising result","score":-0.0215091389}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":184,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"AVI 2020 Workshop on Road Mapping Infrastructures for Artificial Intelligence Supporting Advanced Visual Big Data Analysis, AVI-BDA 2020 and 2nd Italian Workshop on Visualization and Visual Analytics, ITAVIS 2020","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 14 papers.

We construct a ResNet-50-based social detection model to explore the potential relationship between street view images and job-housing attributes. The method extracts street view images of a neighborhood in all eight directions to predict land parcels\u2019 job-housing attributes and uses an entropy index to measure the degree of job-housing mixture in Shenzhen as an example. The social-detection model performs well with a low RMSE (0.1094) in identifying job-housing patterns. The eight-direction neighborhood method shows the best support for sufficient neighborhood information from street view images (RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.1135) compared with other neighborhood methods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using street-view images and deep learning to characterize job-housing attributes consistent with findings from urban studies with socioeconomic data; for example, the research finding concurs that Shenzhen has many high job-housing mixtures with very few areas designated for jobs or residences. The proposed method, when applied regularly, can help monitor spatial dynamics of urban job-housing patterns to inform city planning and development. \u00a9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"deep learning; job-housing; socioeconomic characteristics; street view images; Urban spatial structure","Authors":"Yao Y., Zhang J., Qian C., Wang Y., Ren S., Yuan Z., Guan Q.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2021.1895170","x":5.8400001526,"y":6.2600002289,"KeyPhrases":["neighborhood information","deep learning","urban job","housing pattern","street view image"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"neighborhood information","score":0.5029307604},{"key-phrase":"sufficient neighborhood information","score":0.4686372876},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.4113935828},{"key-phrase":"urban job","score":0.3985370994},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic data","score":0.3788986802},{"key-phrase":"street view image","score":0.3725369573},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.3690482676},{"key-phrase":"large city","score":0.3571677804},{"key-phrase":"city planning","score":0.3563898802},{"key-phrase":"housing attribute","score":0.3405400813},{"key-phrase":"method extracts street","score":0.3367370963},{"key-phrase":"other neighborhood method","score":0.3335139751},{"key-phrase":"housing","score":0.3221264482},{"key-phrase":"social detection model","score":0.3178735673},{"key-phrase":"housing mixture","score":0.290966332},{"key-phrase":"social-detection model","score":0.2903162241},{"key-phrase":"direction neighborhood method","score":0.2873134911},{"key-phrase":"housing pattern","score":0.2771598697},{"key-phrase":"few area","score":0.2667459548},{"key-phrase":"many high job","score":0.2610211968},{"key-phrase":"land parcel","score":0.2539708018},{"key-phrase":"spatial dynamic","score":0.2198479772},{"key-phrase":"Empirical data","score":0.2111965269},{"key-phrase":"job","score":0.2090018094},{"key-phrase":"potential relationship","score":0.1497956365},{"key-phrase":"entropy index","score":0.1368259192},{"key-phrase":"low RMSE","score":0.1285168827},{"key-phrase":"view image","score":0.1116559133},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0289280787}]},{"Cluster":13,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":186,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Estimating Socio-Economic Parameters via Machine Learning Methods Using Luojia1-01 Nighttime Light Remotely Sensed Images at Multiple Scales of China in 2018","Abstract":"Mapping socio-economic indicators with a raster format is still a great challenge. The nighttime light (NTL) datasets have been widely utilized to estimate the socio-economic parameters. However, the precision of the published datasets was too coarse to meet related issues such as flood losses assessment, urban planning, and epidemiological studies. The present study calibrated gross domestic product (GDP), population (POP), electric consumption (EC), and urban build-up area (B-A) at 100 m resolution for 45 cities of China in 2018 using Luojia1-01 NTL datasets via random forest (RF) as well as geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The linear regression (LR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) methods were selected for comparison with GWR and RF models. Besides, the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) was chosen for comparison with Luojia1-01. The ten-folded cross-validation (CV) has been used for evaluating accuracy at county and city scales. Finally, the distribution maps of socio-economic parameters were illustrated and some findings were obtained. First, the validation results revealed that the calibration at the city-scale outperformed the county or district scale. Second, the precision of the Luojia1-01 NTL dataset surpassed the NPP-VIIRS NTL dataset on the same administrative scale except for some specific situations. Third, the precision of the simulation for the gross domestic product (GDP) is the highest than the others, followed by electric consumption (EC), build-up area (B-A), and population (POP). Fourth, the optimum model varied according to the socio-economic parameters. Fifth, the distribution of socio-economic parameters exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity.

As a carrier of human productive activities, buildings are essential to both urban dynamic monitoring and suburban construction inspection. Fully-convolutional-network-based methods have provided a paradigm for automatically extracting buildings from high-resolution imagery. However, high intraclass variance and complexity are two problems in building extraction. It is hard to identify different scales of buildings by using a single receptive field. For this purpose, in this article, we use the stable encoder- decoder architecture, combined with a grid-based attention gate and atrous spatial pyramid pooling module, to capture and restore features progressively and effectively. A modified ResNet50 encoder is also applied to extract features. The proposed method could learn gated features and distinguish buildings from complex surroundings such as trees. We evaluate our model on two building datasets, WHU aerial building dataset and our DB UAV rural building dataset. Experiments show that our model outperforms other five most recent models. The results also exhibit great potential for extracting buildings with different scales and validate the effectiveness of deep learning in practical scenarios. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Attention gate (AG); building extraction; deep learning; fully convolutional networks (FCNs); semantic segmentation","Authors":"Deng W., Shi Q., Li J.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2021.3058097","x":9.06,"y":-5.83,"KeyPhrases":["aerial building dataset","single receptive field","ResNet50 encoder","human productive activity","deep learning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"aerial building dataset","score":0.5419586897},{"key-phrase":"rural building dataset","score":0.441000253},{"key-phrase":"single receptive field","score":0.4084035754},{"key-phrase":"ResNet50 encoder","score":0.3958152533},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.3932607472},{"key-phrase":"suburban construction inspection","score":0.3397718072},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution imagery","score":0.3319734335},{"key-phrase":"encoder","score":0.3239577413},{"key-phrase":"building","score":0.309738338},{"key-phrase":"stable encoder","score":0.3005137444},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2851324081},{"key-phrase":"atrous spatial pyramid","score":0.2785044312},{"key-phrase":"urban dynamic monitoring","score":0.2739135325},{"key-phrase":"complex surroundings","score":0.2451813966},{"key-phrase":"decoder architecture","score":0.2443319559},{"key-phrase":"attention gate","score":0.2289520949},{"key-phrase":"building datasets","score":0.1844040602},{"key-phrase":"DB UAV","score":0.177736491},{"key-phrase":"human productive activity","score":0.1592918038},{"key-phrase":"massive data","score":0.1490678489},{"key-phrase":"disaster management","score":0.1489331871},{"key-phrase":"different scale","score":0.1127418578},{"key-phrase":"recent model","score":0.093614541},{"key-phrase":"great potential","score":0.0783591121},{"key-phrase":"high intraclass variance","score":0.0700080991},{"key-phrase":"practical scenario","score":0.0281109791},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":-0.0311008841}]},{"Cluster":20,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":189,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Classification of Urban Functional Areas from Remote Sensing Images and Time-Series User Behavior Data","Abstract":"Urbanization is accelerating at a rapid rate, which has introduced many challenges, especially in the field of urban planning. Under the backdrop of global urbanization, some cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters that are influenced by unplanned urban expansion. Rational planning of urban functional areas needs to be strengthened to improve the scientific approach of urban planning and urbanization. In this study, the classification of urban functional areas based on dual-modal data (i.e., remote sensing image and user behavior data) was implemented using machine learning (ML) algorithms. After the set test, the classification accuracy of urban functional areas reached 82.45%. Through analysis, it could be concluded that the use of data of two modalities achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by using data of a single modality. The data of the two modalities complement each other, and the use of ML algorithms to train such data can yield good results. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Classification of urban functional areas; convolutional neural network (CNN); light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM); multimodal data","Authors":"Chen C., Yan J., Wang L., Liang D., Zhang W.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2020.3044250","x":6.2300000191,"y":5.7399997711,"KeyPhrases":["urban functional area","classification accuracy","dual-modal data","climate change","user behavior data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban functional area","score":0.5639567375},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5160031915},{"key-phrase":"unplanned urban expansion","score":0.4464814067},{"key-phrase":"global urbanization","score":0.4186692238},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.38688761},{"key-phrase":"ML algorithms","score":0.3723548949},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.338613987},{"key-phrase":"dual-modal data","score":0.2859596908},{"key-phrase":"user behavior data","score":0.223525703},{"key-phrase":"Rational planning","score":0.2085442245},{"key-phrase":"modality","score":0.1721300483},{"key-phrase":"such data","score":0.1712997854},{"key-phrase":"modality complement","score":0.1674279273},{"key-phrase":"climate change","score":0.1375590861},{"key-phrase":"single modality","score":0.1279202402},{"key-phrase":"functional","score":0.0797787756},{"key-phrase":"natural disaster","score":0.0731979609},{"key-phrase":"good result","score":0.0540837571},{"key-phrase":"set test","score":0.0503104925},{"key-phrase":"scientific approach","score":0.0480541773},{"key-phrase":"many challenge","score":0.0187959354},{"key-phrase":"rapid rate","score":0.0028388212}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":190,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban Water Demand Modeling Using Machine Learning Techniques: Case Study of Fortaleza, Brazil","Abstract":"Despite recent efforts to apply machine learning (ML) for water demand modeling, overcoming the black-box nature of these techniques to extract practical information remains a challenge, especially in developing countries. This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale. This study demonstrates how data-driven models can be helpful for water management, especially in environments with strong socioeconomic inequalities, where urban planning decisions should be integrated and inclusive. \u00a9 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Carvalho T.M.N., De Souza Filho F.D.A., Porto V.C.","DOI":"10.1061\/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001310","x":9.0,"y":-2.76,"KeyPhrases":["water demand modeling","random forest","census tract","input variable","economic aspect"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"water demand modeling","score":0.4906821549},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.458481729},{"key-phrase":"water demand pattern","score":0.3864374161},{"key-phrase":"water management","score":0.3838434815},{"key-phrase":"predictive model","score":0.3805128932},{"key-phrase":"water demand","score":0.374720186},{"key-phrase":"urban planning decision","score":0.3544956446},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.3486204743},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3395268023},{"key-phrase":"census tract","score":0.3074175417},{"key-phrase":"census block","score":0.2162432373},{"key-phrase":"spatial scale","score":0.2018712163},{"key-phrase":"capita income","score":0.2008238733},{"key-phrase":"strong socioeconomic inequality","score":0.1907986253},{"key-phrase":"water","score":0.1856881082},{"key-phrase":"household characteristic","score":0.167704463},{"key-phrase":"iterative approach","score":0.1515996307},{"key-phrase":"economic aspect","score":0.1471206993},{"key-phrase":"input variable","score":0.1243283004},{"key-phrase":"black-box nature","score":0.1023606658},{"key-phrase":"demand","score":0.1009037495},{"key-phrase":"coarse scale","score":0.0968325436},{"key-phrase":"practical information","score":0.0960879326},{"key-phrase":"education level","score":0.0946873277},{"key-phrase":"direct relationship","score":0.0831486285},{"key-phrase":"minimum redundancy","score":0.0550718419},{"key-phrase":"fine scale","score":0.0488060229},{"key-phrase":"RF technique","score":0.0465586148},{"key-phrase":"different level","score":0.0409670472},{"key-phrase":"CB scale","score":0.0350876264},{"key-phrase":"CT scale","score":0.0034874883},{"key-phrase":"recent effort","score":-0.0112599758}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":191,"Cited by":null,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Predicting and mapping neighborhood-scale health outcomes: A machine learning approach","Abstract":"Estimating health outcomes at a neighborhood scale is important for promoting urban health, yet costly and time-consuming.

In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes.

Street view images (SVIs) have shown great potential for automated land-use classification for land-use mapping. However, previous studies overlooked SVI-derived location contextual information that may help improve land-use classification. This study proposes a novel land-use classification method that synthesizes location semantics from SVIs to account for contextual information from SVIs, land parcels and roads around the SVIs. The proposed method first generates land-use scene images (LUSIs) by using an SVI-derived straightforward algorithm. The LUSIs are then relocated to land parcels by using a displacement strategy and classified into land-use types by using a deep learning network. This study determines the land-use types of land parcels with classified LUSIs. Two case studies, consisting of LUSIs for five land-use types, show that introducing location semantics of SVIs can remarkably improve the classification accuracy of land-use types. \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"land-use classification; Land-use map; location semantics; street view image","Authors":"Fang F., Yu Y., Li S., Zuo Z., Liu Y., Wan B., Luo Z.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2020.1831515","x":8.69,"y":-5.29,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","deep learning network","use scene image","location semantics","land parcel"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4197363257},{"key-phrase":"Street view image","score":0.4106422663},{"key-phrase":"land parcel","score":0.4044614136},{"key-phrase":"deep learning network","score":0.3979696631},{"key-phrase":"location semantics","score":0.3574183583},{"key-phrase":"use classification","score":0.3391320109},{"key-phrase":"novel land","score":0.3390085399},{"key-phrase":"use map","score":0.3245554268},{"key-phrase":"use classification method","score":0.2890782356},{"key-phrase":"use mapping","score":0.2879142165},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.2823663652},{"key-phrase":"contextual information","score":0.2750135362},{"key-phrase":"svis","score":0.2165791392},{"key-phrase":"use scene image","score":0.1805065423},{"key-phrase":"displacement strategy","score":0.174546957},{"key-phrase":"classified LUSIs","score":0.1469717175},{"key-phrase":"environmental research","score":0.1439518631},{"key-phrase":"use type","score":0.1403380781},{"key-phrase":"straightforward algorithm","score":0.1246142834},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.0631852895},{"key-phrase":"lusis","score":0.0553932339},{"key-phrase":"great potential","score":0.0360252187},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0200211909},{"key-phrase":"previous study","score":-0.0102376146}]},{"Cluster":6,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":194,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A value of civic voices for smart city: A big data analysis of civic queries posed by Seoul citizens","Abstract":"Since urban problems are increasingly becoming complex and multifaceted due to the rapid urbanization, interest in the development of smart cities as an efficient solution to such problems is growing.

The current policy framework to ensure the quality of life of inhabitants leaving no one behind, leads decision-makers to seek better-informed choices for the sustainable planning of urban areas. Thus, a better understanding between the spatial structure of cities and their socio-economic level is of crucial relevance. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to quantify this two-way relationship. Therefore, we measured spatial patterns of 31 cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We rely on spatial pattern metrics derived from a Local Climate Zone classification obtained by fusing remote sensing and open GIS data with a machine learning approach. Based upon the data, we quantified the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and socio-economic variables related to \u2018education\u2019, \u2018health\u2019, \u2018living conditions\u2019, \u2018labor\u2019, and \u2018transport\u2019 by means of multiple linear regression models, explaining the variability of the socio-economic variables from 43% up to 82%. Additionally, we grouped cities according to their level of \u2018quality of life\u2019 using the socio-economic variables, and found that the spatial pattern of low-dense built-up types was different among socio-economic groups. The proposed methodology described in this paper is transferable to other datasets, levels, and regions. This is of great potential, due to the growing availability of open statistical and satellite data and derived products.

The results specified 30 distinct topics related to the Strip, among which the most important ones were exploring different hotels, night scene, people watching, and walking long distances. The visitor experience explored within this study uncovered multiple facets of sense of place on the Strip and suggested urban design strategies and public space management policies related to the programmatic and physical elements of the Strip sidewalks. The study shows how online reviews can provide strong empirical evidence for visitor experience in built environment projects. This approach can be used by landscape architects, urban planners, and policy makers on post-occupancy evaluation and guide redevelopment efforts to provide a full feedback loop. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Big data; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Online reviews; Public space; Sense of place","Authors":"Song Y., Wang R., Fernandez J., Li D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2020.103956","x":6.87,"y":-4.36,"KeyPhrases":["visitor experience","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","Strip sidewalk","public space management","place facet"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"visitor experience","score":0.4695722461},{"key-phrase":"public space management","score":0.4684200883},{"key-phrase":"urban public life","score":0.4544610381},{"key-phrase":"Public space","score":0.4214662611},{"key-phrase":"urban design strategy","score":0.3874227107},{"key-phrase":"Las Vegas Strip","score":0.3776041269},{"key-phrase":"post-occupancy evaluation","score":0.3707690239},{"key-phrase":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation","score":0.3590926826},{"key-phrase":"guide redevelopment effort","score":0.3573619723},{"key-phrase":"Tripadvisor user","score":0.3417446017},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3020623326},{"key-phrase":"different hotel","score":0.292835176},{"key-phrase":"Strip sidewalk","score":0.2879555225},{"key-phrase":"landscape architect","score":0.2765960097},{"key-phrase":"visitor","score":0.2630826235},{"key-phrase":"environment project","score":0.2552371919},{"key-phrase":"distinct topic","score":0.2099166214},{"key-phrase":"place facet","score":0.2084630877},{"key-phrase":"online review","score":0.1935320497},{"key-phrase":"logistic regression machine","score":0.193173632},{"key-phrase":"expensive data collection","score":0.1854979396},{"key-phrase":"night scene","score":0.1807624698},{"key-phrase":"strip","score":0.1725197136},{"key-phrase":"subsequent perception","score":0.1612520814},{"key-phrase":"intangible nature","score":0.1415395737},{"key-phrase":"learning method","score":0.1291796267},{"key-phrase":"multiple facet","score":0.1215664968},{"key-phrase":"strong empirical evidence","score":0.1174326688},{"key-phrase":"full feedback loop","score":0.1049748287},{"key-phrase":"important one","score":0.1022112966},{"key-phrase":"long distance","score":0.099504903},{"key-phrase":"policy maker","score":0.0984869525},{"key-phrase":"programmatic and physical element","score":0.0659293234},{"key-phrase":"key component","score":0.0624956191},{"key-phrase":"regeneration scheme","score":0.0498752743}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":197,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Remote measurement of building usable floor area \u2013 Algorithms fusion","Abstract":"Rapid changes that are taking place in the urban environment have significant impact on urban growth. Most cities and urban regions all over the world compete to increase resident and visitor satisfaction. The growing requirements and rapidity of introducing new technologies to all aspects of residents\u2019 lives force cities and urban regions to implement \u201csmart cities\u201d concepts in their activities. Real estate is one of the principal anthropogenic components of urban environment thus become a subject of thorough multidisciplinary analysis in the field of data requiring spatial information systems. Recent advances in information technology, combined with the increased availability of high-resolution imagery from Earth observation, create an opportunity to use new sources of data that enable to identify, monitor, and solved many of urban environmental problem. The aim of the paper is to elaborate precise, complete and detailed property information with the use of remote sensing observations in a suitable numerical algorithm. The authors concentrate on providing one of the most important, and probably the most lacking, feature describing properties \u2013 building usable floor area (BUFA). The solution is elaborated in the form of an automatic algorithm based on machine learning and computer vision technology related to LiDAR (big data), close range images with respect to spatial information systems requirements. The obtained results related to BUFA estimation in comparison to the state-of-the-art results are satisfactory and may increase the reliability of decision-making in investment, fiscal, registration and planning aspects. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Algorithms fusion; Building usable floor area; Computer vision; Fuzzy theory; Machine learning; Measurement data processing","Authors":"Janowski A., Renigier-Bi\u0142ozor M., Walacik M., Chmielewska A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2020.104938","x":6.5100002289,"y":6.0900001526,"KeyPhrases":["urban environment","usable floor area","complete and detailed property information","automatic algorithm","BUFA estimation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4790740311},{"key-phrase":"urban growth","score":0.4483512044},{"key-phrase":"urban environmental problem","score":0.4452693462},{"key-phrase":"complete and detailed property information","score":0.4374289513},{"key-phrase":"spatial information system","score":0.4292102456},{"key-phrase":"urban region","score":0.424500078},{"key-phrase":"usable floor area","score":0.412899971},{"key-phrase":"smart city","score":0.3854416013},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution imagery","score":0.3007356226},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2928205132},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.2920083404},{"key-phrase":"Earth observation","score":0.2882460654},{"key-phrase":"computer vision technology","score":0.2533364296},{"key-phrase":"automatic algorithm","score":0.241047889},{"key-phrase":"close range image","score":0.1977998763},{"key-phrase":"BUFA estimation","score":0.1846382618},{"key-phrase":"information technology","score":0.1741374284},{"key-phrase":"force city","score":0.1624243706},{"key-phrase":"Real estate","score":0.1613432318},{"key-phrase":"suitable numerical algorithm","score":0.1462151259},{"key-phrase":"visitor satisfaction","score":0.1324180663},{"key-phrase":"art result","score":0.1253816634},{"key-phrase":"thorough multidisciplinary analysis","score":0.1098655835},{"key-phrase":"principal anthropogenic component","score":0.0993565172},{"key-phrase":"new technology","score":0.0857877508},{"key-phrase":"BUFA","score":0.0670807585},{"key-phrase":"requirement","score":0.046297349},{"key-phrase":"significant impact","score":0.0428873971},{"key-phrase":"Rapid change","score":0.0323432162},{"key-phrase":"new source","score":0.0240761936},{"key-phrase":"Recent advance","score":0.0132588744},{"key-phrase":"author concentrate","score":0.011120108}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":198,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2021,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Fine scale surface climate in complex terrain using machine learning","Abstract":"Accurate and high spatial resolution (<100 m) surface climate information is crucial for process-based modelling in hydrology, ecology, agriculture, urban studies etc, especially in complex terrain landscapes where coarse grid resolution information (\u223c10 km) is inadequate to represent pronounced local variability. We used a machine learning-based workflow to predict high resolution (30 m) and sub-daily atmospheric variables fields of near-surface air temperature and humidity, and wind speed. The method used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decomposition applied on ground stations observations or Global Climate Model (GCM) residual error, in a sequence with bias correction and statistical models (Linear Regression-LR, Artificial Neural Network model-ANN and Empirical Quantile Mapping-EQM) to provide downscaling from large scale atmospheric conditions to complex terrain variability. The predictions described relationships of Principal Component (PC) scores dependent on GCM temporal variability on 6-hourly basis (with LR or ANN or EQM), and PC loadings dependent on topographic indexes to help providing horizontal sub-grid extrapolation. The methods were validated with a 1-year dataset from a dense weather stations network deployed in a complex terrain basin in tropical climate of Southeast Brazil. We present an exhaustive description of the PC modes daily\/seasonal variability for each variable, and their spatial variability associated to the topography and thermal driven circulations. The predictions in general substantially improved accuracy when compared to GCM outputs, especially near the valley and in sheltered area where local effects are mandatories. Specially, ANN and EQM significantly improved the predictions at the variability of extreme events, such as the formation of strong cold air pooling or wetting in the valley. \u00a9 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","Author Keywords":"complex terrain; downscaling; high resolution; machine learning; neural networks; principal component analysis; surface climate","Authors":"Martin T.C.M., Rocha H.R., Perez G.M.P.","DOI":"10.1002\/joc.6617","x":-6.3099999428,"y":6.1399998665,"KeyPhrases":["surface climate information","Principal Component Analysis","complex terrain basin","temporal variability","Empirical Quantile Mapping"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"surface climate information","score":0.5191586018},{"key-phrase":"complex terrain variability","score":0.3896397948},{"key-phrase":"Global Climate Model","score":0.3854832947},{"key-phrase":"tropical climate","score":0.3825116158},{"key-phrase":"Principal Component Analysis","score":0.3622469008},{"key-phrase":"atmospheric condition","score":0.3583622873},{"key-phrase":"atmospheric variable field","score":0.331340611},{"key-phrase":"seasonal variability","score":0.3301119804},{"key-phrase":"dense weather station","score":0.3110298812},{"key-phrase":"spatial variability","score":0.3093526363},{"key-phrase":"topographic index","score":0.3018799126},{"key-phrase":"complex terrain landscape","score":0.2761791646},{"key-phrase":"complex terrain basin","score":0.2705417275},{"key-phrase":"Neural Network model","score":0.2636681199},{"key-phrase":"Empirical Quantile Mapping","score":0.2602930069},{"key-phrase":"near-surface air","score":0.2356444299},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2290017754},{"key-phrase":"Linear Regression","score":0.2160915732},{"key-phrase":"temporal variability","score":0.1973219812},{"key-phrase":"Southeast Brazil","score":0.1932877451},{"key-phrase":"Principal Component","score":0.1879685521},{"key-phrase":"statistical model","score":0.1831238866},{"key-phrase":"horizontal sub-grid extrapolation","score":0.1824045628},{"key-phrase":"strong cold air","score":0.1635633707},{"key-phrase":"high spatial resolution","score":0.158050254},{"key-phrase":"year dataset","score":0.1567364335},{"key-phrase":"coarse grid resolution","score":0.153421402},{"key-phrase":"wind speed","score":0.1409598589},{"key-phrase":"variability","score":0.1403770447},{"key-phrase":"large scale","score":0.1393834054},{"key-phrase":"residual error","score":0.1387385428},{"key-phrase":"pronounced local variability","score":0.1330450326},{"key-phrase":"PC modes","score":0.1254213452},{"key-phrase":"bias correction","score":0.11992421},{"key-phrase":"PC loadings","score":0.1187701896},{"key-phrase":"ground station observation","score":0.1171628982},{"key-phrase":"sheltered area","score":0.1142581999},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.0853261277},{"key-phrase":"GCM output","score":0.0796124935},{"key-phrase":"high resolution","score":0.0618555397},{"key-phrase":"GCM","score":0.0609108508},{"key-phrase":"local effect","score":0.0262239724},{"key-phrase":"extreme event","score":0.0179270618},{"key-phrase":"hourly basis","score":0.0063192295},{"key-phrase":"exhaustive description","score":0.0014006067}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":199,"Cited by":17.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"The conceptual basis of water-energy-food nexus governance: systematic literature review using network and discourse analysis","Abstract":"In the last decade, the debate on the governance of water, energy, and food (WEF) has intensified, spurring the emergence of the term \u201cnexus governance.\u201d In general, the reduction of trade-offs and construction of synergies between WEF have been placed on the scientific, political, and economic agenda.

Design\/methodology\/approach: The tools of the study are the way of processing by SML, predicting the future based on the past. Machine learning is benefited from Python advantages. The structure of the study consisted of two main parts, as the majority of the similar studies follow: engineering energy modeling and statistical energy modeling. According to the concept of the study, at first, from 2268 models, some are randomly selected, simulated and sensitively analyzed by ENVI-met. Furthermore, the Envi-met output as the quantity of thermal comfort \u2013 predicted mean vote (PMV) and weather items are inputs of Python. Then, the formed data set is processed by SML, to reach the final reliable predicted output. Findings: The process of SML leads the study to find thermal comfort of current models and other similar sidewalks. The results are evaluated by both PMV mathematical model and SML error evaluation functions. The results confirm that the average of the occurred error is about 1%. Then the method of study is reliable to apply in the variety of similar fields. Finding of this study can be helpful in perspective of the sustainable architecture strategies in the buildings and urban scales, to determine, monitor and control energy-based behaviors (thermal comfort, heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation) in operational phase of the systems (existed elements in buildings, and constructions) and the planning and designing phase of the future built cases \u2013 all over their life spans. Research limitations\/implications: Limitations of the study are related to the study variables and alternatives that are notable impact on the findings. Furthermore, the most trustable input data will result in the more accuracy in output. Then modeling and simulation processes are most significant part of the research to reach the exact results in the final step. Practical implications: Finding of the study can be helpful in urban design strategies. By finding outdoor thermal comfort that resulted from machine learning method, urban and landscape designers, policymakers and architects are able to estimate the features of their designs in air quality and urban health and can be sure in catching design goals in case of thermal comfort in urban atmosphere. Social implications: By 2030, cities are delved as living spaces for about three out of five people. As green infrastructures influence in moderating the cities\u2019 climate, the relationship between green spaces and habitants\u2019 thermal comfort is deduced. Although the strategies to outside thermal comfort improvement, by design methods and applicants, are not new subject to discuss, applying machines that may be common in predicting results can be called as a new insight in applying more effective design strategies and in urban environment\u2019s comfort preparation. Then study\u2019s footprint in social implications stems in learning from the previous projects and developing more efficient strategies to prepare cities as the more comfortable and healthy places to live, with the more efficient models and consuming money and time. Originality\/value: The study achievements are expected to be applied not only in Tehran but also in other climate zones as the pattern in more eco-city design strategies. Although some similar studies are done in different majors, the concept of study is new vision in urban studies. \u00a9 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Green Sidewalks; Hyper parameters learning algorithm; Supervised machine learning; Urban thermal comfort","Authors":"Eslamirad N., Malekpour Kolbadinejad S., Mahdavinejad M., Mehranrad M.","DOI":"10.1108\/SASBE-03-2019-0028","x":4.7399997711,"y":3.3199999332,"KeyPhrases":["outdoor thermal comfort","machine learning method","energy engineering modeling","eco-city design strategy","other similar sidewalk"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"outdoor thermal comfort","score":0.4556147456},{"key-phrase":"eco-city design strategy","score":0.4549584687},{"key-phrase":"outside thermal comfort improvement","score":0.4419077635},{"key-phrase":"sustainable architecture strategy","score":0.4349392951},{"key-phrase":"engineering energy modeling","score":0.4140348434},{"key-phrase":"energy engineering modeling","score":0.4022766948},{"key-phrase":"urban design strategy","score":0.3946017027},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3738718927},{"key-phrase":"statistical energy modeling","score":0.3728539348},{"key-phrase":"thermal comfort","score":0.368132621},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.3336035609},{"key-phrase":"urban atmosphere","score":0.3316007853},{"key-phrase":"green infrastructure influence","score":0.3131763041},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2933393717},{"key-phrase":"green sidewalk","score":0.2744147182},{"key-phrase":"landscape designer","score":0.2622850835},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.2575436831},{"key-phrase":"design method","score":0.2516824007},{"key-phrase":"effective design strategy","score":0.2512704432},{"key-phrase":"other similar sidewalk","score":0.2424315214},{"key-phrase":"urban scale","score":0.2324009091},{"key-phrase":"efficient model","score":0.224082455},{"key-phrase":"air quality","score":0.2166813314},{"key-phrase":"SML error evaluation","score":0.1875581443},{"key-phrase":"weather item","score":0.1826689094},{"key-phrase":"mathematical model","score":0.1806479245},{"key-phrase":"new methodology","score":0.1697104275},{"key-phrase":"design goal","score":0.1533430517},{"key-phrase":"comfortable and healthy place","score":0.1483121812},{"key-phrase":"urban health","score":0.1482639462},{"key-phrase":"simulation process","score":0.1429863721},{"key-phrase":"data set","score":0.1384792328},{"key-phrase":"comfort preparation","score":0.137877509},{"key-phrase":"study variable","score":0.1358928829},{"key-phrase":"comfort","score":0.1336965263},{"key-phrase":"green space","score":0.1310799718},{"key-phrase":"optimum morphology","score":0.1211193725},{"key-phrase":"other climate zone","score":0.1122085229},{"key-phrase":"current model","score":0.1011262015},{"key-phrase":"previous project","score":0.0966065377},{"key-phrase":"Python advantage","score":0.0924721211},{"key-phrase":"mean vote","score":0.0902958214},{"key-phrase":"efficient strategy","score":0.0874888077},{"key-phrase":"life span","score":0.0746522695},{"key-phrase":"study achievement","score":0.0727493465},{"key-phrase":"similar field","score":0.0690189973},{"key-phrase":"Practical implication","score":0.0650735945},{"key-phrase":"similar study","score":0.0632989183},{"key-phrase":"trustable input data","score":0.0573211759},{"key-phrase":"new subject","score":0.0504201129},{"key-phrase":"SML","score":0.050056614},{"key-phrase":"Research limitations","score":0.0330968946},{"key-phrase":"Social implication","score":0.0300301034},{"key-phrase":"operational phase","score":0.0228568316},{"key-phrase":"exact result","score":0.018248437},{"key-phrase":"high quality","score":0.0170069374},{"key-phrase":"new vision","score":0.0080320472},{"key-phrase":"new one","score":-0.0110203736},{"key-phrase":"main part","score":-0.0205263197},{"key-phrase":"significant part","score":-0.0217209961},{"key-phrase":"notable impact","score":-0.0343694985},{"key-phrase":"final step","score":-0.0401705354},{"key-phrase":"new insight","score":-0.041026935}]},{"Cluster":6,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":202,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Opportunities and challenges of geospatial analysis for promoting urban livability in the era of big data and machine learning","Abstract":"Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the \u2018forest\u2019 of data, and to miss the \u2018trees\u2019 of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole \u2018forest\u2019 of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. \u00a9 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

In this paper, we explore the use of satellite image derived building footprint data to classify the residential status of urban buildings in low and middle income countries. A recently developed ensemble machine learning building classification model is applied for the first time to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to Nigeria. The model is informed by building footprint and label data of greater completeness and attribute consistency than have previously been available for these countries. A GIS workflow is described that semiautomates the preparation of data for input to the model. The workflow is designed to be particularly useful to those who apply the model to additional countries and use input data from diverse sources. Results show that the ensemble model correctly classifies between 85% and 93% of structures as residential and nonresidential across both countries. The classification outputs are likely to be valuable in the modelling of human population distributions, as well as in a range of related applications such as urban planning, resource allocation, and service delivery. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Author Keywords":"Data-informed urban design; Greenway planning; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-sourced urban data","Authors":"Tang Z., Ye Y., Jiang Z., Fu C., Huang R., Yao D.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ufug.2020.126871","x":5.5900001526,"y":3.1199998856,"KeyPhrases":["greenway planning","new urban data","machine learning algorithm","human-scale urban design factor","destination accessibility"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"greenway planning","score":0.5871409178},{"key-phrase":"urban greenway network","score":0.5792714357},{"key-phrase":"human-scale urban design factor","score":0.5496223569},{"key-phrase":"greenway suitability analysis","score":0.5489990711},{"key-phrase":"classical urban design theory","score":0.4868069589},{"key-phrase":"new urban data","score":0.4673239887},{"key-phrase":"greenway network generation","score":0.4585392475},{"key-phrase":"classical urban design","score":0.4540642202},{"key-phrase":"multi-sourced urban data","score":0.4510574937},{"key-phrase":"current greenway suitability","score":0.4416970611},{"key-phrase":"Urban greenway","score":0.4335612059},{"key-phrase":"geographical information system","score":0.3310158849},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3181966543},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.3165935278},{"key-phrase":"destination accessibility","score":0.3013742268},{"key-phrase":"positioning data","score":0.2803061604},{"key-phrase":"Maoming City","score":0.2676424682},{"key-phrase":"greenway","score":0.2598492503},{"key-phrase":"geographical and natural issue","score":0.2242833972},{"key-phrase":"human-scale quality","score":0.2125900537},{"key-phrase":"human-scale concern","score":0.1399511695},{"key-phrase":"wide scale","score":0.1127844676},{"key-phrase":"analytical approach","score":0.0900550187},{"key-phrase":"methodological boundary","score":0.0869665742},{"key-phrase":"Ewing's 5D variable","score":0.0824984759},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.0762144253},{"key-phrase":"key factor","score":0.072472252},{"key-phrase":"human-scale resolution","score":0.0554746352},{"key-phrase":"important strategy","score":0.0481365472},{"key-phrase":"new technique","score":0.0020151269},{"key-phrase":"classical","score":-0.0327684358}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":206,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Predicting human perception of the urban environment in a spatiotemporal urban setting using locally acquired street view images and audio clips","Abstract":"This study investigates people's perception of visual and auditory landscapes in a mixed-use urban environment.

The evaluation of the individual perception is done with the help of eight and six auditory and visual perceptual attributes, respectively. The results from the survey are then studied in relation to the features extracted from algorithms. Finally, a street of 10 km length is chosen within the study area where a spatiotemporal street-level visual and auditory data is collected. Statistical analysis and Machine Learning modeling are performed in the surveyed dataset to predict the human perception of audio and visual scenes in the chosen street. The results helped in understanding specific audio and visual features that are related to individual perceptions.

However, implementing these processes involves several issues, namely, data availability, data inconsistency, data scalability, data integration, geocoding, and data privacy. This research addresses the aforementioned information challenges by proposing a generalized integrated methodology that implements bottom-up, data-driven, and spatial modeling approaches for multi-scale Geographic Information System mapping of building energy modeling. This study uses the Irish building stock to map building energy performance at multiple scales. The generalized data-driven methodology uses approximately 650,000 Irish Energy Performance Certificates buildings data to predict more than 2 million buildings\u2019 energy performance. In this case, the approach delivers a prediction accuracy of 88% using deep learning algorithms. These prediction results are then used for spatial modeling at multiple scales from the individual building level to a national level. Furthermore, these maps are coupled with available spatial resources (social, economic, or environmental data) for energy planning, analysis, and support decision-making. The modeling results identify clusters of buildings that have a significant potential for energy savings within any specific region. Geographic Information System-based modeling aids stakeholders in identifying priority areas for implementing energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the stakeholders could target local communities for retrofit campaigns, which would enhance the implementation of sustainable energy policy decisions. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Building energy performance; Data-driven approaches; Energy performance certificate; GIS modeling; Machine learning; Urban building energy modeling; Urban planning","Authors":"Ali U., Shamsi M.H., Bohacek M., Purcell K., Hoare C., Mangina E., O'Donnell J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apenergy.2020.115834","x":4.3800001144,"y":4.1999998093,"KeyPhrases":["building energy modeling","multi-scale Geographic Information","deep learning algorithms","urban building stock","strategic sustainable energy plan"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"building energy modeling","score":0.5729951262},{"key-phrase":"multi-scale Geographic Information","score":0.5040360689},{"key-phrase":"building energy performance","score":0.4663777947},{"key-phrase":"urban building stock","score":0.4599604309},{"key-phrase":"spatial modeling approach","score":0.4428441226},{"key-phrase":"spatial modeling","score":0.421692878},{"key-phrase":"Geographic Information System","score":0.4199675024},{"key-phrase":"strategic sustainable energy plan","score":0.4188203812},{"key-phrase":"energy planning","score":0.4173885882},{"key-phrase":"Urban planner","score":0.4070160687},{"key-phrase":"individual building level","score":0.4063349366},{"key-phrase":"environmental data","score":0.3897351027},{"key-phrase":"sustainable energy policy","score":0.3893676996},{"key-phrase":"building data","score":0.3440906405},{"key-phrase":"energy saving","score":0.3411270976},{"key-phrase":"building","score":0.3410448432},{"key-phrase":"overall energy consumption","score":0.3399002552},{"key-phrase":"energy efficiency measure","score":0.3359342813},{"key-phrase":"available spatial resource","score":0.3338494599},{"key-phrase":"energy policymakers","score":0.3317018747},{"key-phrase":"deep learning algorithms","score":0.305510819},{"key-phrase":"Irish Energy Performance","score":0.2874295712},{"key-phrase":"System mapping","score":0.2763751745},{"key-phrase":"Irish building stock","score":0.2681332827},{"key-phrase":"energy performance","score":0.2555244565},{"key-phrase":"prediction accuracy","score":0.2252833396},{"key-phrase":"data integration","score":0.215265125},{"key-phrase":"local authority","score":0.213765651},{"key-phrase":"data scalability","score":0.2091192752},{"key-phrase":"data privacy","score":0.1951429546},{"key-phrase":"stock modeling","score":0.1911071837},{"key-phrase":"specific region","score":0.1863856316},{"key-phrase":"modeling aid stakeholder","score":0.1820322275},{"key-phrase":"energy","score":0.1799945533},{"key-phrase":"prediction result","score":0.1630642414},{"key-phrase":"aforementioned information challenge","score":0.1490755379},{"key-phrase":"data availability","score":0.1399270296},{"key-phrase":"national level","score":0.1392553896},{"key-phrase":"data inconsistency","score":0.1383012831},{"key-phrase":"priority area","score":0.1374513805},{"key-phrase":"modeling result","score":0.1250555515},{"key-phrase":"multiple scale","score":0.1218133345},{"key-phrase":"significant potential","score":0.1091019809},{"key-phrase":"local community","score":0.0950601548},{"key-phrase":"support decision","score":0.0811966807},{"key-phrase":"such scale","score":0.0737835839},{"key-phrase":"several issue","score":0.00763663}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":208,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Assessing urban growth in Ghana using machine learning and intensity analysis: A case study of the New Juaben Municipality","Abstract":"Population growth coupled with economic, housing and environmental factors have significantly contributed into accelerated land use change in the New Juaben Municipality of Ghana. These factors have caused destruction of natural habitat and increased natural hazards such as flooding in the Municipality. Monitoring land use\/land cover change is essential in respect to the dynamics of both human and natural factors that affect the biophysical and biochemical properties of the land surface. This research investigates the transitions among the major land use\/land cover categories in the Municipality as a highly populated urban region that is facing some environmental challenges such as deforestation and degradation of the environment. Random Forest was adopted for the classification of 1985, 1991, 2002 and 2015 land cover maps while the analysis of the dynamics was conducted using intensity analysis. The unique contribution of this article is the combine usage of machine learning algorithm and intensity analysis to assess the changes in land use\/land cover. The results showed that 1985\u20131991 and 2002\u20132015 periods experience fast change and the land use transformation has been accelerating over the whole period. The major changes were caused by the Built-up and Agricultural activities constituting 21.24 % and 13.19 % respectively in the category level. It is recommended that, authorities should consider several structural transformation measures within Ghana, including inter-sectoral land use harmonization policies (e.g. the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act 2016), land use planning and legal reforms to help address the underlying drivers of urban led deforestation. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Ghana; Intensity analysis; Random forest classification; UN sustainable development goals; Urbanization","Authors":"Nyamekye C., Kwofie S., Ghansah B., Agyapong E., Boamah L.A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2020.105057","x":9.54,"y":-3.68,"KeyPhrases":["land use change","Random Forest","biophysical and biochemical property","intensity analysis","populated urban region"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land use change","score":0.5518165827},{"key-phrase":"land use transformation","score":0.548199892},{"key-phrase":"Monitoring land use","score":0.5306081772},{"key-phrase":"land cover change","score":0.5243352652},{"key-phrase":"land use planning","score":0.5003554821},{"key-phrase":"land cover category","score":0.4955896735},{"key-phrase":"land cover map","score":0.4944728017},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.4892843962},{"key-phrase":"inter-sectoral land use","score":0.4869115055},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.4779361784},{"key-phrase":"major land use","score":0.4727021754},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.4352161884},{"key-phrase":"populated urban region","score":0.3904129267},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3254815936},{"key-phrase":"Agricultural activity","score":0.3241332173},{"key-phrase":"land surface","score":0.3162608743},{"key-phrase":"Population growth","score":0.3126988709},{"key-phrase":"land","score":0.3014031053},{"key-phrase":"New Juaben Municipality","score":0.2956351638},{"key-phrase":"intensity analysis","score":0.2792320549},{"key-phrase":"environmental challenge","score":0.2731825113},{"key-phrase":"Spatial Planning Act","score":0.2713907063},{"key-phrase":"several structural transformation measure","score":0.2691337466},{"key-phrase":"municipality","score":0.2546975017},{"key-phrase":"natural habitat","score":0.2539416552},{"key-phrase":"environmental factor","score":0.2447175682},{"key-phrase":"category level","score":0.1959936619},{"key-phrase":"human and natural factor","score":0.1892754138},{"key-phrase":"natural hazard","score":0.1848125905},{"key-phrase":"fast change","score":0.1769145131},{"key-phrase":"major change","score":0.1207190752},{"key-phrase":"unique contribution","score":0.1011021435},{"key-phrase":"biophysical and biochemical property","score":0.0860481411},{"key-phrase":"legal reform","score":0.0532605499},{"key-phrase":"harmonization policy","score":0.0344258398},{"key-phrase":"whole period","score":0.0273040272},{"key-phrase":"period experience","score":-0.0169657078}]},{"Cluster":7,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":209,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Traffic Clustering Algorithm of Urban Data Brain Based on a Hybrid-Augmented Architecture of Quantum Annealing and Brain-Inspired Cognitive Computing","Abstract":"In recent years, the urbanization process has brought modernity while also causing key issues, such as traffic congestion and parking conflicts. Therefore, cities need a more intelligent \"brain\" to form more intelligent and efficient transportation systems. At present, as a type of machine learning, the traditional clustering algorithm still has limitations. K-means algorithm is widely used to solve traffic clustering problems, but it has limitations, such as sensitivity to initial points and poor robustness. Therefore, based on the hybrid architecture of Quantum Annealing (QA) and brain-inspired cognitive computing, this study proposes QA and Brain-Inspired Clustering Algorithm (QABICA) to solve the problem of urban taxi-stand locations. Based on the traffic trajectory data of Xi'an and Chengdu provided by Didi Chuxing, the clustering results of our algorithm and K-means algorithm are compared. We find that the average taxi-stand location bias of the final result based on QABICA is smaller than that based on K-means, and the bias of our algorithm can effectively reduce the tradition K-means bias by approximately 42%, up to approximately 83%, with higher robustness. QA algorithm is able to jump out of the local suboptimal solutions and approach the global optimum, and brain-inspired cognitive computing provides search feedback and direction. Thus, we will further consider applying our algorithm to analyze urban traffic flow, and solve traffic congestion and other key problems in intelligent transportation. \u00a9 2020 Tsinghua University Press.

Many downstream applications require comprehensive analysis like geographic information retrieval, recommender systems, geographic knowledge graphs, and in general, understanding urban spaces [28]. Points of Interests (POI), as one of the most researched aspects of urban data, has been successfully modeled using concepts borrowed from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the work of Place2Vec [28], a Word2Vec-like statistical model is proposed to represent spatial adjacency with a continuous embedding space. This method successfully models the functional semantics of POIs with regard to several human-assessment based evaluations. However, though the Place2Vec model addresses the distributional heterogeneity within a given spatial context with ITDL augmentation, it does not address the spatial heterogeneity among different regions. To solve this problem, we propose to introduce a hierarchical, density-based, self-adjusting clustering mechanism. The boundary of relatedness and unrelatedness is learned from the given context, where denser areas have tighter bounds while sparser areas have looser ones. We train our model on both the baseline Yelp hierarchical dataset [28] and our OpenStreetMap dataset. We demonstrate that 1) our model significantly improves the performance on 2 of the 3 baseline tasks and the stability of training, and 2) our model generalizes excellently across 112 cities of radically different scales (minimum 1725 POIs, maximum 2694070 POIs), regions (North America, Europe, Asia, Africa) and types (commercial, touristy, industrial, etc.) without the need of adjusting or tuning any hyperparameters. We also demonstrate that our model can be used to discover interesting facts about cities like inter-city semantic analogy and intra-city connectivity, which can be very useful in urban planning, social computing and public policy making. \u00a9 2020 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Geo-Semantics; Machine Learning; Points of Interest; Similarity","Authors":"Wang Z., Moosavi V.","DOI":"10.1145\/3423334.3431450","x":5.79,"y":-3.72,"KeyPhrases":["inter-city semantic analogy","Place2Vec model","hierarchical dataset","geographic information retrieval","baseline Yelp"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"inter-city semantic analogy","score":0.6035026908},{"key-phrase":"Place2Vec model","score":0.5580925941},{"key-phrase":"geographic information retrieval","score":0.5435808897},{"key-phrase":"geographic knowledge graphs","score":0.5298480988},{"key-phrase":"urban data","score":0.4706164598},{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.468244791},{"key-phrase":"spatial adjacency","score":0.4475697279},{"key-phrase":"OpenStreetMap dataset","score":0.4237829149},{"key-phrase":"spatial context","score":0.4068574905},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3989163041},{"key-phrase":"spatial heterogeneity","score":0.3505753875},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical dataset","score":0.3449299335},{"key-phrase":"intra-city connectivity","score":0.3248306513},{"key-phrase":"Natural Language Processing","score":0.3092259467},{"key-phrase":"continuous embedding space","score":0.2658052742},{"key-phrase":"social computing","score":0.2651197314},{"key-phrase":"Machine Learning","score":0.2542898059},{"key-phrase":"clustering mechanism","score":0.2420559376},{"key-phrase":"baseline Yelp","score":0.2335517406},{"key-phrase":"recommender system","score":0.2141733468},{"key-phrase":"like statistical model","score":0.2017824203},{"key-phrase":"distributional heterogeneity","score":0.1933603138},{"key-phrase":"functional semantics","score":0.1932229996},{"key-phrase":"like","score":0.1903392822},{"key-phrase":"different region","score":0.1766116172},{"key-phrase":"rich source","score":0.145665586},{"key-phrase":"North America","score":0.1207392737},{"key-phrase":"interesting fact","score":0.1129294485},{"key-phrase":"different scale","score":0.1016501561},{"key-phrase":"pois","score":0.0980213881},{"key-phrase":"baseline task","score":0.084083274},{"key-phrase":"public policy making","score":0.080881536},{"key-phrase":"ITDL augmentation","score":0.0677774847},{"key-phrase":"Many downstream application","score":0.0308447629},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive analysis","score":-0.0004863851}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":211,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Machine learning technologies for sustainability in smart cities in the post-covid era","Abstract":"The unprecedented urban growth of recent years requires improved urban planning and management to make urban spaces more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

This paper takes Guangzhou city as the study area, illustrates the gridded population distribution map by using machine learning methods based on zoning strategy with multisource geospatial data such as night light remote sensing data, point of interest data, land use data, and so on. The street-level accuracy evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieved good overall accuracy, with determinant coefficient (R2) being 0.713 and root mean square error (RMSE) being 5512.9. Meanwhile, the goodness of fit for single linear regression (LR) model and random forest (RF) regression model are 0.0039 and 0.605, respectively. For dense area, the accuracy of the random forest model is better than the linear regression model, while for sparse area, the accuracy of the linear regression model is better than the random forest model. The results indicated that the proposed method has great potential in fine-scale population mapping. Therefore, it is advised that the zonal modeling strategy should be the primary choice for solving regional differences in the population distribution mapping research. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Many cities in these states show high growth dynamics, but little is known about the relation of conflicts and urban growth. In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime, which lasted from 1996 to 2001, caused large scale displacement of the population. People from Afghanistan migrated to neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan, and all developments came to a halt. After the US invasion in October 2001, all the major cities in Afghanistan experienced significant population growth, in particular, driven by the influx of internally displaced persons. Maximum pressure of this influx was felt by the capital city, Kabul. This rapid urbanization, combined with very limited capacity of local authorities to deal with this growth, led to unplanned urbanization and challenges for urban planning and management. This study analyses the patterns of growth between 2001 and 2017, and the factors influencing the growth in the city of Kabul with the help of high-resolution Earth Observation-based data (EO) and spatial logistic regression modelling. We analyze settlement patterns by extracting image features from high-resolution images (aerial photographs of 2017) and terrain features as input to a random forest classifier. The urban growth is analyzed using an available built-up map (extracted from IKONOS images for the year 2001). Results indicate that unplanned settlements have grown 4.5 times during this period, whereas planned settlements have grown only 1.25 times. The unplanned settlements expanded mostly towards the west and north west parts of the city, and the growth of planned settlements happened mainly in the central and eastern parts of the city. Population density and the locations of military bases are the most important factors that influence the growth, of both planned and unplanned settlements. The growth of unplanned settlement occurs predominantly in areas of steeper slopes on the hillside, while planned settlements are on gentle slopes and closer to the institutional areas (central and eastern parts of the city). We conclude that security and availability of infrastructure were the main drivers of growth for planned settlements, whereas unplanned growth, mainly on hillsides, was driven by the availability of land with poor infrastructure. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project\u2014in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

The integration with the 3D geometry makes this prediction model not only useful to the scientific research, but also as an urban planning tool for environmentally sustainable design. For model development, meteorological data and urban morphology features were used to predict the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily daytime average temperature and daily night-time average temperature. Voting regression (VOT) based on ordinary least square and random forests was used as the regression model. The average CV-R2 and the CV-RMSE predicted by VOT for the outdoor air temperature were 0.84 and 0.52\u00b0C. Compared with ordinary least squares, VOT improved R2 by an average of 18% and RMSE by an average of 24%. Sensitivity analysis indicated the daytime temperature was inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of urban canyon streets. In tropical climates, greenery can be used as a cooling measure. A negative logarithmic relationship was found between the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and green plot ratio. This shows that as the green coverage increases, the cooling effect of greenery increases, and it is more effective to adopt greenery early in areas with less vegetation. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"CityGML; Data-driven model; Outdoor air temperature; Urban canyon aspect ratio","Authors":"Chen S., Zhang W., Wong N.H., Ignatius M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2020.107314","x":-6.3699998856,"y":6.5100002289,"KeyPhrases":["microclimate simulation program","urban morphology feature","square and random forest","greenery increase","tropical climate"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"microclimate simulation program","score":0.4805580974},{"key-phrase":"outdoor air temperature","score":0.4660493135},{"key-phrase":"urban morphology feature","score":0.4444730878},{"key-phrase":"outdoor temperature","score":0.4422726035},{"key-phrase":"daytime temperature","score":0.4408506453},{"key-phrase":"CityGML file","score":0.4022898674},{"key-phrase":"urban planning tool","score":0.3907209635},{"key-phrase":"daily minimum temperature","score":0.3895048499},{"key-phrase":"meteorological data","score":0.3847664595},{"key-phrase":"urban morphology","score":0.3779430091},{"key-phrase":"daily maximum temperature","score":0.3588491678},{"key-phrase":"prediction model","score":0.3556066751},{"key-phrase":"tropical climate","score":0.3515766263},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3494201899},{"key-phrase":"sustainable design","score":0.3349102437},{"key-phrase":"square and random forest","score":0.3245890439},{"key-phrase":"regression model","score":0.3193125129},{"key-phrase":"average temperature","score":0.3090105653},{"key-phrase":"greenery increase","score":0.2811942697},{"key-phrase":"temperature","score":0.2760128379},{"key-phrase":"Voting regression","score":0.2757639289},{"key-phrase":"model development","score":0.2687726617},{"key-phrase":"green coverage increase","score":0.2224813104},{"key-phrase":"urban canyon street","score":0.2203983665},{"key-phrase":"Sensitivity analysis","score":0.1844266653},{"key-phrase":"green plot ratio","score":0.1649230123},{"key-phrase":"daily daytime","score":0.1495918781},{"key-phrase":"3D geometry","score":0.1476711035},{"key-phrase":"geometric input","score":0.0986646116},{"key-phrase":"daily night","score":0.0883554742},{"key-phrase":"scientific research","score":0.0842010379},{"key-phrase":"negative logarithmic relationship","score":0.0687541217},{"key-phrase":"average CV","score":0.0672704577},{"key-phrase":"aspect ratio","score":0.0664986446},{"key-phrase":"daily","score":0.0577932298}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":216,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban ambient air temperature estimation using hyperlocal data from smart vehicle-borne sensors","Abstract":"High-quality temperature data at a finer spatio-temporal scale is critical for analyzing the risk of heat exposure and hazards in urban environments. The variability of urban landscapes makes cities a challenging environment for quantifying heat exposure. Most of the existing heat hazard studies have inherent limitations on two fronts; first, the spatio-temporal granularities are too coarse, and second, the inability to track the ambient air temperature (AAT) instead of land surface temperature (LST). Overcoming these limitations requires developing models for mapping the variability in heat exposure in urban environments. We investigated an integrated approach for mapping urban heat hazards by harnessing a diverse set of high-resolution measurements, including both ground-based and satellite-based temperature data. We mounted vehicle-borne mobile sensors on city buses to collect high-frequency temperature data throughout 2018 and 2019. Our research also incorporated key biophysical parameters and Landsat 8 LST data into Random Forest regression modeling to map the hyperlocal variability of heat hazard over areas not covered by the buses. The vehicle-borne temperature sensor data showed large temperature differences within the city, with the largest variations of up to 10 \u00b0C and morning-afternoon diurnal changes at a magnitude around 20 \u00b0C. Random Forest modeling on noontime (11:30 am \u2013 12:30 pm) data to predict AAT produced accurate results with a mean absolute error of 0.29 \u00b0C and successfully showcased the enhanced granularity in urban heat hazard mapping. These maps revealed well-defined hyperlocal variabilities in AAT, which were not evident with other research approaches. Urban core and dense residential areas revealed larger than 5 \u00b0C AAT differences from their nearby green spaces. The sensing framework developed in this study can be easily implemented in other urban areas, and findings from this study will be beneficial in understanding the heat vulnerabilities of individual communities. It can be used by the local government to devise targeted hazard mitigation efforts such as increasing green space, developing better heat-safety policies, and exposure warning for workers. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Human thermal comfort; Machine learning; Mobile sensing; Smart and connected communities; Urban heat hazards","Authors":"Yin Y., Tonekaboni N.H., Grundstein A., Mishra D.R., Ramaswamy L., Dowd J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101538","x":-6.0999999046,"y":6.8899998665,"KeyPhrases":["urban heat hazard","Random Forest regression","diurnal change","land surface temperature","mobile sensor"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban heat hazard","score":0.6564218402},{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.5297340155},{"key-phrase":"temperature data","score":0.4692731202},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4582915902},{"key-phrase":"heat hazard study","score":0.4468954802},{"key-phrase":"ambient air temperature","score":0.404173106},{"key-phrase":"temperature sensor data","score":0.3984351158},{"key-phrase":"heat hazard","score":0.3893583417},{"key-phrase":"heat exposure","score":0.3766821921},{"key-phrase":"urban landscape","score":0.3569282889},{"key-phrase":"dense residential area","score":0.3549869061},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest modeling","score":0.3537406325},{"key-phrase":"other urban area","score":0.351996243},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest regression","score":0.3446410298},{"key-phrase":"heat vulnerability","score":0.3400517702},{"key-phrase":"hyperlocal variability","score":0.3192963898},{"key-phrase":"city bus","score":0.3084328175},{"key-phrase":"heat","score":0.3016948104},{"key-phrase":"High-quality temperature","score":0.2917421758},{"key-phrase":"diurnal change","score":0.2829515636},{"key-phrase":"Urban core","score":0.2795568109},{"key-phrase":"large temperature difference","score":0.276648581},{"key-phrase":"high-frequency temperature","score":0.273845017},{"key-phrase":"LST data","score":0.2637269795},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal granularity","score":0.2462456971},{"key-phrase":"mobile sensor","score":0.2342595458},{"key-phrase":"exposure warning","score":0.2231448889},{"key-phrase":"nearby green space","score":0.2128359228},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal scale","score":0.210834384},{"key-phrase":"hazard mitigation effort","score":0.1615348458},{"key-phrase":"green space","score":0.1570457369},{"key-phrase":"challenging environment","score":0.1504853368},{"key-phrase":"key biophysical parameter","score":0.1385535002},{"key-phrase":"local government","score":0.1196841151},{"key-phrase":"other research approach","score":0.0965064764},{"key-phrase":"safety policy","score":0.087782383},{"key-phrase":"accurate result","score":0.0835374743},{"key-phrase":"mean absolute error","score":0.0796810091},{"key-phrase":"diverse set","score":0.0728462115},{"key-phrase":"individual community","score":0.0623860061},{"key-phrase":"integrated approach","score":0.0578558631},{"key-phrase":"AAT","score":0.0520232692},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution measurement","score":0.0415882692},{"key-phrase":"inherent limitation","score":-0.0236305706},{"key-phrase":"C AAT difference","score":-0.040362455}]},{"Cluster":26,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":217,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban pluvial flooding prediction by machine learning approaches \u2013 a case study of Shenzhen city, China","Abstract":"Urban pluvial flooding is a threatening natural hazard in urban areas all over the world, especially in recent years given its increasing frequency of occurrence. In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events \u2013 especially in the future climate \u2013 this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning. \u00a9 2020 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Rainfall threshold; Shenzhen city; Urban pluvial flooding","Authors":"Ke Q., Tian X., Bricker J., Tian Z., Guan G., Cai H., Huang X., Yang H., Liu J.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.advwatres.2020.103719","x":13.470000267,"y":3.25,"KeyPhrases":["Urban pluvial flooding","discriminant analysis","several rainfall threshold","early warning system","ML model"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Urban pluvial flooding","score":0.555798769},{"key-phrase":"flood occurrence","score":0.5187556148},{"key-phrase":"several rainfall threshold","score":0.5139911175},{"key-phrase":"rainfall threshold","score":0.4838495851},{"key-phrase":"frequent pluvial flood event","score":0.4802782834},{"key-phrase":"multiple-resolution rainfall","score":0.449916929},{"key-phrase":"conventional critical rainfall curve","score":0.4454345107},{"key-phrase":"flood","score":0.427636236},{"key-phrase":"non-flood event","score":0.4264548421},{"key-phrase":"rainfall","score":0.4165539443},{"key-phrase":"pluvial flood","score":0.4134132862},{"key-phrase":"urban water manager","score":0.371823132},{"key-phrase":"other urban catchment","score":0.3693173528},{"key-phrase":"early warning system","score":0.3482084274},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3401299715},{"key-phrase":"ML model","score":0.3377720714},{"key-phrase":"discriminant analysis","score":0.3010807633},{"key-phrase":"hydraulic model","score":0.2968761325},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.2834631205},{"key-phrase":"emergency planning","score":0.2628121674},{"key-phrase":"future climate","score":0.2433871329},{"key-phrase":"threatening natural hazard","score":0.2270382643},{"key-phrase":"false alert rate","score":0.2267250866},{"key-phrase":"rational information","score":0.1899032593},{"key-phrase":"Shenzhen city","score":0.1709680259},{"key-phrase":"true positive rate","score":0.1640756279},{"key-phrase":"critical index","score":0.1502447873},{"key-phrase":"simulation accuracy","score":0.1335098892},{"key-phrase":"computational complexity","score":0.1232493073},{"key-phrase":"peak intensity","score":0.12050917},{"key-phrase":"emergency action","score":0.1113501787},{"key-phrase":"Such model","score":0.1113175973},{"key-phrase":"conventional model","score":0.1099824011},{"key-phrase":"large volume","score":0.1095382795},{"key-phrase":"principal component","score":0.1078686267},{"key-phrase":"risky area","score":0.0960740149},{"key-phrase":"arrival time","score":0.0940899402},{"key-phrase":"binary result","score":0.0673009008},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.044184301},{"key-phrase":"great extent","score":0.0127064157},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":-0.005848825},{"key-phrase":"different combination","score":-0.01938878},{"key-phrase":"subsequent aftermath","score":-0.0531835295},{"key-phrase":"Previous study","score":-0.0592346042}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":218,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A hybrid air pollutant concentration prediction model combining secondary decomposition and sequence reconstruction","Abstract":"Acid rain is a serious threat to terrestrial ecosystems. To provide more accurate early warning information for acid rain prevention, urban planning, and travel planning, a novel air pollutant prediction model was proposed in this paper to predict NO2 and SO2. First, the data were decomposed into several sub-sequences by a complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. Second, the subsequences are reconstructed by variational mode decomposition and sample entropy. Then, the new subsequences are predicted by the extreme learning machine combined with the whale optimization algorithm. The empirical analysis was carried out through 8 data sets. According to the experimental results, three main conclusions can be drawn. First, the proposed model in this paper has excellent prediction performance and robustness. In all the comparison experiments, the R2 and RMSE of the proposed model are the best among all the models. Second, data preprocessing is very necessary. After adding the decomposition algorithm, the average improvement levels of R2 and RMSE were 897.57% and 50.78%, respectively. Third, the re-decomposition of IMF1 is an effective method to improve prediction accuracy. After the re-decomposition of IMF1, R2 can be improved by 13.64% on average on the original basis, and RMSE can be reduced by 31.99% on average. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for the research of air pollutant prediction. In future work, the application of the proposed model in other air pollutants or other regions can be explored. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Acid rain; Air pollutant prediction; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Extreme learning machine; Sample entropy; Whale optimization algorithm","Authors":"Sun W., Huang C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2020.115216","x":-4.9099998474,"y":8.4300003052,"KeyPhrases":["air pollutant prediction","extreme learning machine","variational mode decomposition","sample entropy","new subsequence"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"air pollutant prediction","score":0.6176656485},{"key-phrase":"extreme learning machine","score":0.530185461},{"key-phrase":"prediction model","score":0.4337570667},{"key-phrase":"empirical mode decomposition","score":0.4034071565},{"key-phrase":"accurate early warning information","score":0.359539032},{"key-phrase":"excellent prediction performance","score":0.3491052091},{"key-phrase":"novel air pollutant","score":0.341281116},{"key-phrase":"whale optimization algorithm","score":0.3400700688},{"key-phrase":"prediction accuracy","score":0.3368137479},{"key-phrase":"Acid rain","score":0.3342548609},{"key-phrase":"other air pollutant","score":0.33205235},{"key-phrase":"acid rain prevention","score":0.3141722679},{"key-phrase":"variational mode decomposition","score":0.2779583335},{"key-phrase":"complete ensemble","score":0.2582247853},{"key-phrase":"decomposition algorithm","score":0.2512732148},{"key-phrase":"adaptive noise","score":0.2357270867},{"key-phrase":"data preprocessing","score":0.2287954539},{"key-phrase":"sample entropy","score":0.2242289782},{"key-phrase":"empirical analysis","score":0.2063139975},{"key-phrase":"new subsequence","score":0.1332719326},{"key-phrase":"subsequence","score":0.1208835691},{"key-phrase":"several sub-sequences","score":0.1082185507},{"key-phrase":"effective method","score":0.1072617099},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.1011773348},{"key-phrase":"average improvement level","score":0.0995060802},{"key-phrase":"acid","score":0.0883970112},{"key-phrase":"experimental result","score":0.0657858849},{"key-phrase":"serious threat","score":0.0645108074},{"key-phrase":"terrestrial ecosystem","score":0.063030906},{"key-phrase":"travel planning","score":0.0599570386},{"key-phrase":"original basis","score":0.0548790284},{"key-phrase":"other region","score":0.0466635078},{"key-phrase":"future work","score":0.0384915322},{"key-phrase":"comparison experiment","score":0.0380012095},{"key-phrase":"main conclusion","score":-0.0005224925},{"key-phrase":"valuable reference","score":-0.0140800048}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":219,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The shape of segregation: The role of urban form in immigrant assimilation","Abstract":"The built environment can mediate or constrain the opportunities for social interaction, essential to the formation of social ties.

However, due to the lack of complete directly measured data on urban traffic flow, existing studies cannot adequately mine the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations characterizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Electronic registration identification (ERI), which is an emerging technology for uniquely identifying a vehicle, can help collect the travel records of all vehicles. This inspires us to employ ERI big data for traffic flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spatial-temporal feature optimization method with ERI big data for short-term traffic flow prediction based on a gradient\u2013boosted regression tree, called DSTO-GBRT. Firstly, the framework of DSTO-GBRT is built. Secondly, we analyze the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations among the current prediction point and upstream correlative points using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Thirdly, to eliminate the linear correlations among features, we exploit principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the original training data and obtain optimized training data. In the experiment, real-world ERI big data from Chongqing are employed for the proposed DSTO-GBRT method. Compared with ST-GBRT, ARIMA, DSTO-BPNN and DSTO-SVM, the results demonstrate that DSTO-GBRT can provide timely and adaptive prediction even in rush hour, when traffic conditions change rapidly. Furthermore, compared with DSO-GBRT and DTO-GBRT, the results show that the proposed DSTO-GBRT method is more accurate. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Dynamic spatial-temporal feature; ERI big data; Gradient-boosted regression tree; Principal component analysis; Traffic flow prediction","Authors":"Zheng L., Yang J., Chen L., Sun D., Liu W.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.neucom.2020.05.038","x":5.38,"y":-1.99,"KeyPhrases":["traffic flow prediction","Electronic registration identification","principal component analysis","GBRT method","spatial-temporal correlation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"traffic flow prediction","score":0.6246870756},{"key-phrase":"urban traffic flow","score":0.428958714},{"key-phrase":"flow prediction","score":0.4160988033},{"key-phrase":"intelligent transportation system","score":0.4013797343},{"key-phrase":"timely and adaptive prediction","score":0.3897189796},{"key-phrase":"short-term traffic","score":0.3848721385},{"key-phrase":"traffic flow","score":0.3703599572},{"key-phrase":"traffic condition change","score":0.367320776},{"key-phrase":"principal component analysis","score":0.3649733663},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.3480705917},{"key-phrase":"regression tree","score":0.3356710672},{"key-phrase":"spatial-temporal correlation","score":0.329133004},{"key-phrase":"spatial-temporal feature","score":0.3273750544},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.2942788005},{"key-phrase":"current prediction point","score":0.286700964},{"key-phrase":"urban road network","score":0.2845159471},{"key-phrase":"original training data","score":0.2804557085},{"key-phrase":"Electronic registration identification","score":0.2415029705},{"key-phrase":"rush hour","score":0.2058067322},{"key-phrase":"urban planning application","score":0.1986699849},{"key-phrase":"linear correlation","score":0.1897128075},{"key-phrase":"GBRT","score":0.1845741123},{"key-phrase":"GBRT method","score":0.1814610362},{"key-phrase":"transportation operation","score":0.1768705547},{"key-phrase":"travel record","score":0.1577509493},{"key-phrase":"upstream correlative point","score":0.1482031345},{"key-phrase":"DSTO","score":0.1464532614},{"key-phrase":"optimization method","score":0.1391372681},{"key-phrase":"real-world ERI","score":0.1280329674},{"key-phrase":"important basis","score":0.0829417408},{"key-phrase":"Pearson correlation coefficient","score":0.0764778554},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":-0.0085317437}]},{"Cluster":28,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":221,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Machine learning-based methods for path loss prediction in urban environment for LTE networks","Abstract":"This paper presents prediction path loss models in an urban environment for cellular networks with the help of machine learning methods.

Among the examined algorithms, KNN shows the best performance, thus being an appealing option to predict path loss in urban areas.

Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

This enables data-driven building and energy models to capture the urban dynamics, specifically the intrinsic occupant and energy use behavioural profiles that are not usually considered in traditional models. Although there are related reviews, none investigated urban data for use in modelling occupant behaviour and energy use at multiple scales, from buildings to neighbourhood to city. This survey paper aims to fill this gap by providing a critical summary and analysis of the works reported in the literature. We present the different sources of occupant-centric urban data that are useful for data-driven modelling and categorise the range of applications and recent data-driven modelling techniques for urban behaviour and energy modelling, along with the traditional stochastic and simulation-based approaches.

Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions. This will play a vital role in sustaining Jordan's food security. \u00a9 2020Environmental science, Computer science, Geography, Land use planning, Land use change, Urban growth, Machine learning, Urban planning, Modeling; Artificial intelligence, Cellular Automata, Markov Chain. \u00a9 2020","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Cellular Automata; Computer science; Environmental science; Geography; Land use change; Land use planning; Machine learning; Markov Chain; Modeling; Urban growth; Urban planning","Authors":"Gharaibeh A., Shaamala A., Obeidat R., Al-Kofahi S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.heliyon.2020.e05092","x":8.99,"y":-3.18,"KeyPhrases":["future land change","Cellular Automata Markov","Urban growth","model prediction","Jordan's food security"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"future land change","score":0.5514864922},{"key-phrase":"Urban growth","score":0.5401547551},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion pattern","score":0.534399271},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion","score":0.4769052863},{"key-phrase":"Cellular Automata Markov","score":0.4454579949},{"key-phrase":"land fertility","score":0.4151527584},{"key-phrase":"temporal and spatial modeling","score":0.3946131468},{"key-phrase":"future city","score":0.3581331074},{"key-phrase":"agricultural region","score":0.3529799581},{"key-phrase":"Jordan's food security","score":0.3346618414},{"key-phrase":"potential transition map","score":0.3279388249},{"key-phrase":"ANN Data","score":0.3233974278},{"key-phrase":"Neural Network","score":0.3204587698},{"key-phrase":"model prediction","score":0.2796569765},{"key-phrase":"actual map","score":0.2732565999},{"key-phrase":"Artificial Intelligence","score":0.2594889998},{"key-phrase":"urban center","score":0.2395790219},{"key-phrase":"accurate prediction","score":0.1962626129},{"key-phrase":"MC model","score":0.1813154221},{"key-phrase":"Irbid city","score":0.164902702},{"key-phrase":"management strategy","score":0.1557802856},{"key-phrase":"use change","score":0.1357095838},{"key-phrase":"local authority","score":0.1184782013},{"key-phrase":"simulation capability","score":0.1172790751},{"key-phrase":"Many recent study","score":0.1172369868},{"key-phrase":"challenging process","score":0.1171910018},{"key-phrase":"Kappa index","score":0.0955061167},{"key-phrase":"precise simulation","score":0.0860978737},{"key-phrase":"CA","score":0.0816106871},{"key-phrase":"additional input","score":0.0586387627},{"key-phrase":"original CA","score":0.0487778932},{"key-phrase":"environmental variable","score":0.0480714291},{"key-phrase":"many puzzling factor","score":0.0435910821},{"key-phrase":"MC","score":0.0248243734},{"key-phrase":"vital role","score":0.0004400425}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":226,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Precise object detection using adversarially augmented local\/global feature fusion","Abstract":"Object detection, which aims at recognizing or locating the objects of interest in remote sensing imagery with high spatial resolutions (HSR), plays a significant role in many real-world scenarios, e.g., environment monitoring, urban planning, civil infrastructure construction, disaster rescuing, and geographic image retrieval. As a long-lasting challenging problem in both machine learning and geoinformatics communities, many approaches have been proposed to tackle it. However, previous methods always overlook the abundant information embedded in the HSR remote sensing images. The effectiveness of these methods, e.g., accuracy of detection, is therefore limited to some extent. To overcome the mentioned challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel two-phase deep framework, dubbed GLGOD-Net, to effectively detect meaningful objects in HSR images. GLGOD-Net firstly attempts to learn the enhanced deep representations from super-resolution image data. Fully utilizing the augmented image representations, GLGOD-Net then learns the fused representations into which both local and global latent features are implanted. Such fused representations learned by GLGOD-Net can be used to precisely detect different objects in remote sensing images. The proposed framework has been extensively tested on a real-world HSR image dataset for object detection and has been compared with several strong baselines. The remarkable experimental results validate the effectiveness of GLGOD-Net. The success of GLGOD-Net not only advances the cutting-edge of image data analytics, but also promotes the corresponding applicability of deep learning in remote sensing imagery. \u00a9 2020","Author Keywords":"Data augmentation; Geospatial object detection; High spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery; Local\/global feature fusion; Super resolution generative adversarial network","Authors":"Han X., He T., Ong Y.-S., Zhong Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.engappai.2020.103710","x":9.54,"y":-5.73,"KeyPhrases":["deep representation","geoinformatics community","super-resolution image data","real-world HSR","geographic image retrieval"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"deep representation","score":0.4374144077},{"key-phrase":"deep framework","score":0.435416609},{"key-phrase":"deep learning","score":0.4096780419},{"key-phrase":"geographic image retrieval","score":0.3834680021},{"key-phrase":"global latent feature","score":0.3760741949},{"key-phrase":"image dataset","score":0.3690938354},{"key-phrase":"high spatial resolution","score":0.3621430397},{"key-phrase":"super-resolution image data","score":0.3467659354},{"key-phrase":"Object detection","score":0.3264824152},{"key-phrase":"image representation","score":0.3014211059},{"key-phrase":"image data analytics","score":0.285723865},{"key-phrase":"meaningful object","score":0.2686141133},{"key-phrase":"HSR image","score":0.2648769021},{"key-phrase":"geoinformatics community","score":0.2220437378},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2182191461},{"key-phrase":"different object","score":0.2176483721},{"key-phrase":"abundant information","score":0.1985650063},{"key-phrase":"environment monitoring","score":0.1847501099},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.1707389653},{"key-phrase":"civil infrastructure construction","score":0.144380182},{"key-phrase":"GLGOD","score":0.1314929724},{"key-phrase":"HSR","score":0.1266676337},{"key-phrase":"significant role","score":0.1220326945},{"key-phrase":"several strong baseline","score":0.0960282907},{"key-phrase":"real-world HSR","score":0.0903155357},{"key-phrase":"many approach","score":0.070119381},{"key-phrase":"real-world scenario","score":0.0435222685},{"key-phrase":"remarkable experimental result","score":0.0325703248},{"key-phrase":"previous method","score":0.0247925352},{"key-phrase":"long-lasting_VBG challenging problem","score":-0.0389995351}]},{"Cluster":25,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":227,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Water Distribution-Transportation Interface Connectivity Responding to Urban Geospatial Morphology","Abstract":"Water distribution and transportation systems are geospatially colocated, forming a network of connections. This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity. These findings hold implications for urban planning and water distribution design to mitigate potential cascading failures. \u00a9 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":"Complexity; Interdependency; Transportation networks; Urban morphology; Water distribution networks","Authors":"Abdel-Mottaleb N., Zhang Q.","DOI":"10.1061\/(ASCE)IS.1943-555X.0000563","x":13.0900001526,"y":1.3700000048,"KeyPhrases":["city's interface network","random forest model","different geospatial morphology","water distribution design","potential cascading failure"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"city's interface network","score":0.6254438162},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4794766307},{"key-phrase":"transportation interface network","score":0.4553004801},{"key-phrase":"network analysis","score":0.4548667073},{"key-phrase":"topological connectivity","score":0.4354633391},{"key-phrase":"connectivity cluster","score":0.4091763496},{"key-phrase":"transportation system","score":0.3942197859},{"key-phrase":"connectivity profile","score":0.3583591878},{"key-phrase":"Water distribution","score":0.348731041},{"key-phrase":"interface network connectivity","score":0.3479395509},{"key-phrase":"interface network","score":0.3422283828},{"key-phrase":"multiple city","score":0.340763092},{"key-phrase":"connectivity","score":0.3407050669},{"key-phrase":"water distribution design","score":0.3396059275},{"key-phrase":"geospatial morphology","score":0.3240690231},{"key-phrase":"different geospatial morphology","score":0.3198361695},{"key-phrase":"geospatial colocation","score":0.2937830389},{"key-phrase":"forty interface network","score":0.2929796576},{"key-phrase":"major nodal feature","score":0.2681167126},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2656128407},{"key-phrase":"random forest model","score":0.2589119077},{"key-phrase":"failure propagation","score":0.2555226088},{"key-phrase":"nodal attribute","score":0.2405726314},{"key-phrase":"path length","score":0.2143050432},{"key-phrase":"different city","score":0.2060507089},{"key-phrase":"potential cascading failure","score":0.2052505016},{"key-phrase":"interface","score":0.172108233},{"key-phrase":"predictive power","score":0.1611171216},{"key-phrase":"hold implication","score":-0.0622585341}]},{"Cluster":21,"Score":0.8613670192,"DocId":228,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Predicting urban cold-air paths using boosted regression trees","Abstract":"Ensuring the transport of colder air masses from rural surroundings or inner urban open spaces into the dense urban center is a vital approach for reducing nocturnal warming of urban areas in summer, i.e. the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Hence, cold-air paths are an important mitigation aspect in urban planning. The identification of cold-air paths by field measurements, however, is time-consuming and it is difficult to cover larger spatial domains (e.g. entire cities). Therefore, we used a machine learning technique, boosted regression trees (BRT), for estimating the spatial distribution of cold-air paths in three German cities (Braunschweig, Freiburg, Stuttgart). We identified the most important predictor variables for cold-air path occurrence and tested the spatial transferability of BRT models from one training city to the other study cities. Three variables explaining differences in surface elevation indicated strongest influence on spatial distribution of cold-air paths: relative surface elevation, topographic position index, and topographic wind index. We achieved predictions for the spatial distribution of cold-air paths for cities the model was trained on, resulting in model performances of 0.85 < AUC < 0.96 (AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Model transfers to other cities, however, achieved only poor to moderate results (0.5 < AUC < 0.8). The city of Freiburg tended to be the most suitable basis for a general model, since it covers the largest range of conditions. Transfer works best for \u2018similar\u2019 cities, i.e. cities with a comparable range of predictor variables and morphological structure.

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =\u223c130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep\/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities.

Within urban spaces, these areas have also an important role in preventing illegal occupation in areas of hydrologic risk, such as in floodplains. The goal of this research is to propose a framework for identifying areas of permanent protection associated with perennial drainage, utilizing satellite imagery and digital elevation models (DEM) in association with machine learning techniques. The specific objectives include the development of a decision tree to retrieve perennial drainage over high resolution, 1-meter DEM's, and the development of digital image processing workflow to retrieve surface water bodies from Sentinel-2 imagery. In-situ information on perennial and ephemeral conditions of streams and rivers were obtained to validate our results, that happened in the first trimester of 2020. We propose a minimum of 7 days without precipitation prior to in-situ validation, for more accurate assessment of streamflow conditions, in order to minimize impacts of surface water runoff in flow regime. The proposed method will benefit decision makers by providing them with reliable information on drainage network and their buffer zones, as well as yield detailed mapping of the areas of permanent protection that are key to urban planning and management. \u00a9 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","Author Keywords":"Digital Elevation Models; Machine Learning; Perennial Drainage; Riparian Vegetation; Sentinel-2","Authors":"Montibeller A., Vilela M., Hino F., Mallmann P., Nadas M., Caruso F., Delabary H.","DOI":"10.5194\/isprs-archives-XLIII-B3-2020-161-2020","x":9.81,"y":-3.94,"KeyPhrases":["perennial drainage","decision tree","satellite imagery","Riparian vegetation","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"perennial drainage","score":0.4571826458},{"key-phrase":"hydrologic risk","score":0.4370909929},{"key-phrase":"drainage network","score":0.4357967377},{"key-phrase":"Riparian vegetation","score":0.4334914088},{"key-phrase":"satellite imagery","score":0.4146667719},{"key-phrase":"surface water runoff","score":0.4082853496},{"key-phrase":"drainage","score":0.3792401254},{"key-phrase":"riverine system","score":0.375302434},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3676607907},{"key-phrase":"soil erosion","score":0.367336452},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3581876159},{"key-phrase":"digital image processing","score":0.3369834125},{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.3228385448},{"key-phrase":"digital elevation model","score":0.3009214997},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.2801180482},{"key-phrase":"streamflow condition","score":0.2538237572},{"key-phrase":"water quality","score":0.2111220807},{"key-phrase":"surface water body","score":0.2061196566},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.194268167},{"key-phrase":"detailed mapping","score":0.1824684143},{"key-phrase":"perennial and ephemeral condition","score":0.1759623736},{"key-phrase":"situ information","score":0.1753003448},{"key-phrase":"reliable information","score":0.1685226858},{"key-phrase":"flow regime","score":0.1629783511},{"key-phrase":"perennial","score":0.161006391},{"key-phrase":"accurate assessment","score":0.1593355983},{"key-phrase":"buffer zone","score":0.1574475914},{"key-phrase":"meter DEM's","score":0.1407651007},{"key-phrase":"situ validation","score":0.1403477788},{"key-phrase":"high resolution","score":0.1262135506},{"key-phrase":"permanent protection","score":0.0988091007},{"key-phrase":"illegal occupation","score":0.0788064674},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0775986314},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0315704122},{"key-phrase":"first trimester","score":0.0261088982},{"key-phrase":"key role","score":-0.0117855277}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":231,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A NOVEL SELF-TAUGHT LEARNING FRAMEWORK USING SPATIAL PYRAMID MATCHING for SCENE CLASSIFICATION","Abstract":"Remote sensing earth observation images have a wide range of applications in areas like urban planning, agriculture, environment monitoring, etc. While the industrial world benefits from availability of high resolution earth observation images since recent years, interpreting such images has become more challenging than ever. Among many machine learning based methods that have worked out successfully in remote sensing scene classification, spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding (ScSPM) is a classical model that has achieved promising classification accuracy on many benchmark data sets. ScSPM is a three-stage algorithm, composed of dictionary learning, sparse representation and classification. It is generally believed that in the dictionary learning stage, although unsupervised, one should use the same data set as classification stage to get good results. However, recent studies in transfer learning suggest that it might be a better strategy to train the dictionary on a larger data set different from the one to classify. In our work, we propose an algorithm that combines ScSPM with self-taught learning, a transfer learning framework that trains a dictionary on an unlabeled data set and uses it for multiple classification tasks. In the experiments, we learn the dictionary on Caltech-101 data set, and classify two remote sensing scene image data sets: UC Merced LandUse data set and Changping data set. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of proposed method is compatible to that of ScSPM. Our work thus provides a new way to reduce resource cost in learning a remote sensing scene image classifier. \u00a9 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","Author Keywords":"High Resolution Imagery; Remote Sensing; Scene Classification; Self-taught Learning; Spatial Pyramid Matching","Authors":"Yang Y., Zhu D., Ren F., Cheng C.","DOI":"10.5194\/isprs-archives-XLIII-B2-2020-725-2020","x":9.6,"y":-5.51,"KeyPhrases":["transfer learning","high resolution earth","spatial pyramid matching","sparse representation","scene image classifier"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"transfer learning","score":0.4782855511},{"key-phrase":"transfer learning framework","score":0.4622842073},{"key-phrase":"dictionary learning","score":0.459295392},{"key-phrase":"sparse coding","score":0.4493702948},{"key-phrase":"scene image classifier","score":0.4402109385},{"key-phrase":"scene classification","score":0.4350690842},{"key-phrase":"sparse representation","score":0.4330401421},{"key-phrase":"spatial pyramid matching","score":0.412090838},{"key-phrase":"earth observation image","score":0.3445856571},{"key-phrase":"high resolution earth","score":0.3206782341},{"key-phrase":"scene image data","score":0.3051557541},{"key-phrase":"multiple classification task","score":0.3016156554},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.2723346651},{"key-phrase":"promising classification accuracy","score":0.2692972422},{"key-phrase":"many machine learning","score":0.2519442439},{"key-phrase":"unlabeled data","score":0.2441604137},{"key-phrase":"observation image","score":0.2164642811},{"key-phrase":"dictionary learning stage","score":0.2131562382},{"key-phrase":"same data","score":0.2070021927},{"key-phrase":"Changping data set","score":0.185361892},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.1550010741},{"key-phrase":"dictionary","score":0.1429992318},{"key-phrase":"environment monitoring","score":0.141192317},{"key-phrase":"many benchmark data","score":0.1334906816},{"key-phrase":"classification stage","score":0.1277068555},{"key-phrase":"scspm","score":0.1187616959},{"key-phrase":"UC Merced LandUse","score":0.1159902513},{"key-phrase":"such image","score":0.1078847125},{"key-phrase":"resource cost","score":0.0813095272},{"key-phrase":"industrial world benefit","score":0.0614735186},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0604056343},{"key-phrase":"wide range","score":0.0401570573},{"key-phrase":"good result","score":0.0305645354},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.018680023},{"key-phrase":"stage algorithm","score":0.0037320368},{"key-phrase":"new way","score":-0.0050455905},{"key-phrase":"Experimental result","score":-0.0121994382},{"key-phrase":"classical model","score":-0.0168001279},{"key-phrase":"recent study","score":-0.0291741602}]},{"Cluster":26,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":232,"Cited by":17.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Landslide susceptibility assessment of wildfire burnt areas through earth-observation techniques and a machine learning-based approach","Abstract":"Climate change has increased the likelihood of the occurrence of disasters like wildfires, floods, storms, and landslides worldwide in the last years. Weather conditions change continuously and rapidly, and wildfires are occurring repeatedly and diffusing with higher intensity. The burnt catchments are known, in many parts of the world, as one of the main sensitive areas to debris flows characterized by different trigger mechanisms (runoff-initiated and debris slide-initiated debris flow). The large number of studies produced in recent decades has shown how the response of a watershed to precipitation can be extremely variable, depending on several on-site conditions, as well as the characteristics of precipitation duration and intensity. Moreover, the availability of satellite data has significantly improved the ability to identify the areas affected by wildfires, and, even more importantly, to carry out post-fire assessment of burnt areas. Many difficulties have to be faced in attempting to assess landslide risk in burnt areas, which present a higher likelihood of occurrence; in densely populated neighbourhoods, human activities can be the cause of the origin of the fires. The latter is, in fact, one of the main operations used by man to remove vegetation along slopes in an attempt to claim new land for pastures or construction purposes. Regarding the study area, the Camaldoli and Agnano hill (Naples, Italy) fires seem to act as a predisposing factor, while the triggering factor is usually represented by precipitation. Eleven predisposing factors were chosen and estimated according to previous knowledge of the territory and a database consisting of 400 landslides was adopted. The present work aimed to expand the knowledge of the relationship existing between the triggering of landslides and burnt areas through the following phases: (1) Processing of the thematic maps of the burnt areas through band compositions of satellite images; and (2) landslide susceptibility assessment through the application of a new statistical approach (machine learning techniques). The analysis has the scope to support decision makers and local agencies in urban planning and safety monitoring of the environment. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Landslide; Machine learning; Naples municipality; Remote sensing; Susceptibility mapping; Wildfire","Authors":"Di Napoli M., Marsiglia P., Di Martire D., Ramondini M., Ullo S.L., Calcaterra D.","DOI":"10.3390\/RS12152505","x":12.6899995804,"y":3.8399999142,"KeyPhrases":["landslide susceptibility assessment","machine learning technique","post-fire assessment","satellite data","Climate change"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"landslide susceptibility assessment","score":0.6563897729},{"key-phrase":"landslide risk","score":0.5783609152},{"key-phrase":"post-fire assessment","score":0.4426580667},{"key-phrase":"landslide","score":0.3922611475},{"key-phrase":"debris flow","score":0.3298277855},{"key-phrase":"debris slide","score":0.3044911623},{"key-phrase":"precipitation duration","score":0.299341023},{"key-phrase":"Weather condition change","score":0.2891029119},{"key-phrase":"thematic map","score":0.2738406062},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.2541832924},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2541276217},{"key-phrase":"satellite data","score":0.2479023039},{"key-phrase":"satellite image","score":0.2389821261},{"key-phrase":"new statistical approach","score":0.2324849069},{"key-phrase":"Climate change","score":0.2308905125},{"key-phrase":"Agnano hill","score":0.2271589637},{"key-phrase":"site condition","score":0.185572207},{"key-phrase":"burnt","score":0.1709981561},{"key-phrase":"safety monitoring","score":0.1427369118},{"key-phrase":"Many difficulty","score":0.1417584121},{"key-phrase":"human activity","score":0.1399895102},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.133505553},{"key-phrase":"previous knowledge","score":0.1164506599},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.109594956},{"key-phrase":"different trigger mechanism","score":0.102955319},{"key-phrase":"main sensitive area","score":0.0912028477},{"key-phrase":"construction purpose","score":0.0844629556},{"key-phrase":"new land","score":0.0744631588},{"key-phrase":"local agency","score":0.069965452},{"key-phrase":"band composition","score":0.0685845166},{"key-phrase":"large number","score":0.027681984},{"key-phrase":"last year","score":0.0214504357},{"key-phrase":"many part","score":0.0127923973},{"key-phrase":"recent decade","score":-0.0024293214},{"key-phrase":"main operation","score":-0.021037221},{"key-phrase":"present work","score":-0.0237451363}]},{"Cluster":7,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":233,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Development of people mass movement simulation framework based on reinforcement learning","Abstract":"Understanding individual and crowd dynamics in urban environments is critical for numerous applications, such as urban planning, traffic forecasting, and location-based services.

In this study, we developed a reinforcement learning-based approach for modeling and simulation of people mass movement using the global positioning system (GPS) data. Unlike traditional travel demand modeling approaches, our method focuses on the problem of inferring the spatio-temporal preferences of individuals from the observed trajectories, and is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) techniques. We applied the model to the data collected from a smartphone application and attempted to replicate a large amount of the population's daily movement by incorporating with agent-based multi-modal traffic simulation technologies. The simulation results indicate that agents can successfully learn and generate human-like travel activities.

While this information is not globally available, it can be substituted by digital surface models (DSMs), automatically produced from inexpensive satellite imagery. However, stereo DSMs often suffer from noise and blur. Furthermore, they are heavily distorted by vegetation, which is of lesser relevance for most applications. Such basic models can be filtered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on labels derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and 3D city models, in order to obtain a refined DSM. We propose a modular multi-task learning concept that consolidates existing approaches into a generalized framework. Our encoder-decoder models with shared encoders and multiple task-specific decoders leverage roof type classification as a secondary task and multiple objectives including a conditional adversarial term. The contributing single-objective losses are automatically weighted in the final multi-task loss function based on learned uncertainty estimates.

It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation's companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers\u2019 companies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"ISO 37120; Machine learning; Smart City services; Text Classification; Topic Classification","Authors":"Bencke L., Cechinel C., Munoz R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.future.2020.03.057","x":6.57,"y":-2.74,"KeyPhrases":["Smart City","distinct text datasets","machine learning algorithms","official social network profile","ISO category"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Smart City","score":0.5389364958},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.4237419069},{"key-phrase":"urban data","score":0.4003016949},{"key-phrase":"sustainable city","score":0.3778914213},{"key-phrase":"Decision Tree","score":0.3712665439},{"key-phrase":"social network","score":0.3429915905},{"key-phrase":"Linear Vector Classification","score":0.342856437},{"key-phrase":"high-tech city","score":0.3362246156},{"key-phrase":"distinct text datasets","score":0.317237854},{"key-phrase":"different city service","score":0.3133980036},{"key-phrase":"rapid urbanization","score":0.3099573851},{"key-phrase":"Logistic Regression","score":0.3044146299},{"key-phrase":"citizen message","score":0.283159256},{"key-phrase":"Complement Naive Bayes","score":0.2744886875},{"key-phrase":"official social network profile","score":0.1881846786},{"key-phrase":"community dashboard","score":0.1802031994},{"key-phrase":"public and private service","score":0.1741334796},{"key-phrase":"transportation's company","score":0.1698306054},{"key-phrase":"ISO category","score":0.1498790085},{"key-phrase":"governmental support decision","score":0.1471640766},{"key-phrase":"governmental","score":0.1433587968},{"key-phrase":"cultural producer","score":0.1379945874},{"key-phrase":"Solid Waste","score":0.1366791725},{"key-phrase":"governmental entity","score":0.1343253702},{"key-phrase":"environmental agency","score":0.1238661706},{"key-phrase":"International Organization","score":0.1053420603},{"key-phrase":"such model","score":0.0930536091},{"key-phrase":"present paper","score":0.0796836242},{"key-phrase":"Different model","score":0.0674367249},{"key-phrase":"police office","score":0.0582482554},{"key-phrase":"average F1","score":0.0543514825},{"key-phrase":"ISO","score":0.0535244197},{"key-phrase":"cultural event","score":0.0487992987},{"key-phrase":"different ISO","score":0.0278300941},{"key-phrase":"Initial result","score":-0.0096420124}]},{"Cluster":14,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":236,"Cited by":12.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A robust segmentation framework for closely packed buildings from airborne LiDAR point clouds","Abstract":"Urban villages (UVs) are commonly found in many Asian cities. These villages contain many closely packed buildings constructed decades ago without proper urban planning. There is a need for those buildings to be identified and put into statistics. In this paper, we present a segmentation framework that invokes multiple machine learning techniques and point cloud\/image processing algorithms to segment individual closely packed buildings from large urban scenes. The presented framework consists of two major segmentation processes. The framework first filters out the non-ground objects from the point cloud, then it classified them by using the Random Forest classifier to isolate buildings from the entire scene. After that, the building point clouds will be segmented based on several building attribute analysis methods. This is followed by using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) plane filtering method to expand the space between two closely packed buildings, so that the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering technique can be used to more accurately segment each individual building from the closely packed building areas. Two airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets collected in two different cities with some typical closely packed buildings were used to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can effectively identify the closely packed buildings with unified structures from large airborne LiDAR datasets. The overall segmentation accuracy reaches 84% for the two datasets. The proposed framework can serve as a basis for analysis and segmentation of closely packed buildings with a more complicated structure. \u00a9 2020, \u00a9 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Wang X., Chan T.O., Liu K., Pan J., Luo M., Li W., Wei C.","DOI":"10.1080\/01431161.2020.1727053","x":9.01,"y":-5.13,"KeyPhrases":["large airborne LiDAR datasets","clustering technique","several building attribute","Random Forest classifier","overall segmentation accuracy"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"large airborne LiDAR datasets","score":0.456951797},{"key-phrase":"segmentation framework","score":0.4388204813},{"key-phrase":"building point clouds","score":0.4382907748},{"key-phrase":"large urban scene","score":0.4253022671},{"key-phrase":"Spatial Clustering","score":0.4204072952},{"key-phrase":"point cloud","score":0.3849645257},{"key-phrase":"individual building","score":0.3641861677},{"key-phrase":"major segmentation process","score":0.3630301952},{"key-phrase":"Urban village","score":0.3545798659},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest classifier","score":0.3452807069},{"key-phrase":"clustering technique","score":0.3424445987},{"key-phrase":"several building attribute","score":0.3339025974},{"key-phrase":"overall segmentation accuracy","score":0.3231749237},{"key-phrase":"image processing algorithm","score":0.3141552806},{"key-phrase":"packed building area","score":0.3080186844},{"key-phrase":"proper urban planning","score":0.3050703108},{"key-phrase":"airborne Light Detection","score":0.2945353687},{"key-phrase":"many Asian city","score":0.2661706209},{"key-phrase":"plane filtering method","score":0.2399461567},{"key-phrase":"unified structure","score":0.2396882176},{"key-phrase":"complicated structure","score":0.2166656852},{"key-phrase":"packed building","score":0.2109190524},{"key-phrase":"Random Sample Consensus","score":0.191209197},{"key-phrase":"different city","score":0.1893850863},{"key-phrase":"non-ground object","score":0.139097333},{"key-phrase":"entire scene","score":0.1033739075},{"key-phrase":"first filters","score":0.0908141807},{"key-phrase":"multiple machine","score":0.0831395313},{"key-phrase":"packed","score":0.0605503172},{"key-phrase":"analysis method","score":0.0508523062},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0424838066},{"key-phrase":"closely","score":-0.005919355}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":237,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Object detection of aerial image using mask-region convolutional neural network (mask R-CNN)","Abstract":"The most fundamental task in remote sensing data processing and analysis is object detection.

Land-use distribution is one of the key factors affecting air quality, and research on the impact of land-use distribution on air pollution has drawn wide attention. However, considerable studies have mostly used linear regression models, which fail to capture the nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns) and to show how impacts on PM2.5 vary with land-use magnitudes. In addition, related studies have generally focused on annual analyses, ignoring the seasonal variability of the impact of land-use distribution on PM2.5, thus leading to possible estimation biases for PM2.5 . This study was designed to address these issues and assess the impacts of land-use distribution on PM2.5 in Weifang, China. A machine learning statistical model, the boosted regression tree (BRT), was applied to measure nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM2.5, capture how land-use magnitude impacts PM2.5 across different seasons, and explore the policy implications for urban planning. The main conclusions are that the air quality will significantly improve with an increase in grassland and forest area, especially below 8% and 20%, respectively. When the distribution of construction land is greater than around 10%, the PM2.5 pollution can be seriously substantially increased with the increment of their areas. The impact of gardens and farmland presents seasonal characteristics. It is noted that as the weather becomes colder, the inhibitory effect of vegetation distribution on the PM2.5 concentration gradually decreases, while the positive impacts of artificial surface distributions, such as construction land and roads, are aggravated because leaves drop off in autumn (September\u2013November) and winter (December\u2013February). According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that Weifang should strengthen pollution control in winter, for instance, expand the coverage areas of evergreen vegetation like Pinus bungeana Zucc. and Euonymus japonicus Thunb, and increase the width and numbers of branches connecting different main roads. The findings also provide quantitative and optimal land-use planning and strategies to minimize PM2.5 pollution, referring to the status of regional urbanization and greening construction. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Deep Learning; LSTM; Machine Learning; POI; Urban Mobility Prediction","Authors":"Askari B., Le Quy T., Ntoutsi E.","DOI":"10.1109\/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7","x":5.34,"y":-2.13,"KeyPhrases":["taxi","vanilla LSTM model","IoT sensor","real-world dataset","deep sequence learning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"taxi","score":0.4780937731},{"key-phrase":"deep sequence learning","score":0.4472747445},{"key-phrase":"taxi fleet","score":0.437075913},{"key-phrase":"mobility data","score":0.4163972139},{"key-phrase":"other taxis","score":0.4134263396},{"key-phrase":"smart city","score":0.413203299},{"key-phrase":"urban mobility","score":0.4091535807},{"key-phrase":"vanilla LSTM model","score":0.4090251923},{"key-phrase":"particular urban area","score":0.3311107159},{"key-phrase":"mobility data source","score":0.3145033419},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3015989661},{"key-phrase":"optimize traffic efficiency","score":0.2963756025},{"key-phrase":"IoT sensor","score":0.2941391766},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.2927521467},{"key-phrase":"city planning","score":0.2880207896},{"key-phrase":"modern city","score":0.2743178606},{"key-phrase":"Google Maps","score":0.2715402246},{"key-phrase":"passenger information","score":0.2657613754},{"key-phrase":"other mobility service","score":0.2653865218},{"key-phrase":"large city","score":0.2548803389},{"key-phrase":"control air pollution","score":0.2333286256},{"key-phrase":"real-world dataset","score":0.2255865335},{"key-phrase":"vacant vehicle","score":0.2037333548},{"key-phrase":"passenger","score":0.2018604577},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood location","score":0.1742611825},{"key-phrase":"energy consumption","score":0.1650139093},{"key-phrase":"enough information","score":0.1485976279},{"key-phrase":"Mean Squared Error","score":0.1333594024},{"key-phrase":"same area","score":0.1328552365},{"key-phrase":"average error","score":0.1222666055},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.106043309},{"key-phrase":"baseline method","score":0.097612679},{"key-phrase":"vital public service","score":0.0936739445},{"key-phrase":"help company","score":0.0716383904},{"key-phrase":"Percentage Error","score":0.0578865223},{"key-phrase":"Symmetric Mean Absolute","score":0.0520309284},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0512047485},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0380903259},{"key-phrase":"external factor","score":0.0071110558}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":241,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A deep learning approach to urban street functionality prediction based on centrality measures and stacked denoising autoencoder","Abstract":"In urban planning and transportation management, the centrality characteristics of urban streets are vital measures to consider. Centrality can help in understanding the structural properties of dense traffic networks that affect both human life and activity in cities. Many cities classify urban streets to provide stakeholders with a group of street guidelines for possible new rehabilitation such as sidewalks, curbs, and setbacks. Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments. In our work, a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) predicts a street's functionality, then logistic regression is used as a classifier. Our proposed classifier can differentiate between four different classes adopted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT): principal arterial road, minor arterial road, collector road, and local road. The SDAE-based model showed that regular grid configurations with repeated patterns are more influential in forming the functionality of road networks compared to those with less regularity in their spatial structure. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design. This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO's utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices. \u00a9 2020 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Agent-based models; big data; computing with heterogeneous data; digital decision support systems; human mobility; intelligent transportation systems; smart cities; system dynamics; urban informatics","Authors":"Feygin S.A., Lazarus J.R., Forscher E.H., Golfier-Vetterli V., Lee J.W., Gupta A., Waraich R.A., Sheppard C.J.R., Bayen A.M.","DOI":"10.1145\/3384344","x":-3.9600000381,"y":6.5300002098,"KeyPhrases":["urban mobility landscape","planning decision support","machine learning competition","cyberphysical system","data scientist"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban mobility landscape","score":0.5380554199},{"key-phrase":"urban transportation system","score":0.4801675081},{"key-phrase":"planning decision support","score":0.4713100493},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.4711854458},{"key-phrase":"transportation intervention strategy","score":0.4588080645},{"key-phrase":"urban data","score":0.4580925703},{"key-phrase":"Transportation Optimization","score":0.4203584492},{"key-phrase":"new open source transportation","score":0.4096205235},{"key-phrase":"adaptive plan","score":0.4007291794},{"key-phrase":"high-level regional planning goal","score":0.3655869365},{"key-phrase":"Uber Technologies","score":0.3609701395},{"key-phrase":"data scientist","score":0.3453966975},{"key-phrase":"machine learning competition","score":0.3353097737},{"key-phrase":"optimization algorithms","score":0.3198865652},{"key-phrase":"flexible and innovative mobility technology","score":0.2973481417},{"key-phrase":"cyberphysical system","score":0.2720313072},{"key-phrase":"possible technological disruption","score":0.2697396278},{"key-phrase":"BISTRO framework","score":0.2664909959},{"key-phrase":"new framework","score":0.2504204512},{"key-phrase":"optimization approach","score":0.2491751015},{"key-phrase":"growth scenario","score":0.2433859557},{"key-phrase":"uncertain future state","score":0.2409590781},{"key-phrase":"participatory stakeholder engagement","score":0.2264883518},{"key-phrase":"Berkeley Integrated System","score":0.2256909311},{"key-phrase":"benchmark model","score":0.2200452238},{"key-phrase":"methodological framework","score":0.2032730728},{"key-phrase":"Sioux Falls","score":0.1650953293},{"key-phrase":"constraint specification","score":0.1605793983},{"key-phrase":"objective function","score":0.1575047821},{"key-phrase":"BISTRO's utility","score":0.1403826326},{"key-phrase":"search space","score":0.1238986477},{"key-phrase":"BISTRO","score":0.1158706099},{"key-phrase":"competition","score":0.1145284176},{"key-phrase":"intervention strategy","score":0.1130438894},{"key-phrase":"few approach","score":0.1048380435},{"key-phrase":"rigorous analysis","score":0.1026456133},{"key-phrase":"South Dakota","score":0.10201855},{"key-phrase":"feedback mechanism","score":0.0782508031},{"key-phrase":"current trend","score":0.0741370916},{"key-phrase":"unbounded region","score":0.0551257432},{"key-phrase":"top-scoring team","score":0.0370886177},{"key-phrase":"massive ingestion","score":0.0296971519},{"key-phrase":"important finding","score":0.0111895371},{"key-phrase":"other hand","score":-0.0315142721}]},{"Cluster":4,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":243,"Cited by":20.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Note","Title":"Smart cities and a data-driven response to COVID-19","Abstract":"This commentary describes the rapid development of a COVID-19 data dashboard utilising existing Urban Observatory Internet of Things (IoT) data and analytics infrastructure.

Cellular automata (CA) are extensively employed given their simplicity, flexibility, and intuitiveness when simulating dynamic LUC. Previous research, however, has ignored the spatial heterogeneity among sub-regions, instead applying the same transition rules across entire regions; moreover, most existing methods extract neighborhood effects with only one data time slice, which is inconsistent with the nature of neighborhood interactions as a long-term process exhibiting obvious spatiotemporal dependency. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid cellular automata model coupling area partitioning and spatiotemporal neighborhood features learning, named PST-CA. We use a machine-learning-based partitioning strategy, self-organizing map (SOM), to divide entire regions into several homogeneous sub-regions, and further apply a spatiotemporal three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to extract the spatiotemporal neighborhood features. An artificial neural network (ANN) is then built to create a conversion probability map for each sub-region using both spatiotemporal neighborhood features and factors that drive the LUC. Finally, the dynamic simulation results of entire study area are generated by fusing these probability maps, constraints and stochastic factors. Land use data collected from 2000 to 2015 in Shanghai were selected to verify our proposed method. Four traditional models were implemented for comparison, including logistic regression (LR)-CA, support vector machine (SVM)-CA, random forest (RF)-CA and conventional ANN-CA. Results illustrate that the proposed PST-CA outperformed four traditional models, with overall accuracy increased by 4.66%~6.41%. Moreover, three distinctly different \u201ccoverage rate-growth rate\u201d composite patterns of built-up areas are shown in the SOM partitioning results, which verifies SOM's ability to address spatial heterogeneity; while the optimal time steps in 3D CNN generally maintained a positive correlation with the growth rate of built-up areas, which implies longer temporal dependency should be captured for rapidly developing areas. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Cellular automata; Land use; Neighborhood effects; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatiotemporal features","Authors":"Qian Y., Xing W., Guan X., Yang T., Wu H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2020.137738","x":8.93,"y":-3.15,"KeyPhrases":["Land use data","hybrid cellular automaton model","spatiotemporal neighborhood feature","Urbanization process","probability map"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Land use data","score":0.5147803426},{"key-phrase":"land use change","score":0.4848501682},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4653699994},{"key-phrase":"Urbanization process","score":0.4620660841},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal neighborhood feature","score":0.4376731813},{"key-phrase":"Cellular automata","score":0.4255855083},{"key-phrase":"hybrid cellular automaton model","score":0.4066941738},{"key-phrase":"spatial heterogeneity","score":0.3831493855},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.318659395},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.2951960564},{"key-phrase":"obvious spatiotemporal dependency","score":0.2862026691},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood effect","score":0.2826163471},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood interaction","score":0.2769650221},{"key-phrase":"probability map","score":0.2709044814},{"key-phrase":"several homogeneous sub-regions","score":0.2491317987},{"key-phrase":"entire region","score":0.2398965955},{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.2347958386},{"key-phrase":"conversion probability map","score":0.2312832475},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.2249214351},{"key-phrase":"coupling area partitioning","score":0.1829556078},{"key-phrase":"logistic regression","score":0.1796869785},{"key-phrase":"growth rate","score":0.1784310043},{"key-phrase":"entire study area","score":0.163284421},{"key-phrase":"coverage rate","score":0.1578584611},{"key-phrase":"partitioning strategy","score":0.1546568573},{"key-phrase":"data time slice","score":0.1543541998},{"key-phrase":"3D CNN","score":0.1409054101},{"key-phrase":"conventional ANN","score":0.1402423829},{"key-phrase":"temporal dependency","score":0.1374877989},{"key-phrase":"decision support","score":0.118218042},{"key-phrase":"same transition rule","score":0.1163374558},{"key-phrase":"long-term process","score":0.1143948808},{"key-phrase":"dynamic simulation result","score":0.1041422635},{"key-phrase":"stochastic factor","score":0.1034534425},{"key-phrase":"CA","score":0.0866789222},{"key-phrase":"dynamic LUC","score":0.0810920447},{"key-phrase":"optimal time step","score":0.0772336125},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0592091233},{"key-phrase":"traditional model","score":0.0588942394},{"key-phrase":"existing method extract","score":0.0585669205},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.053205058},{"key-phrase":"composite pattern","score":0.0520904921},{"key-phrase":"Previous research","score":0.0464605764},{"key-phrase":"recent decade","score":0.0455075055},{"key-phrase":"positive correlation","score":0.0016076737},{"key-phrase":"LUC","score":0.0007555299},{"key-phrase":"SOM's ability","score":-0.0091886967}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":246,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Analysis of BeiDou\/Galileo combined pseudo-range positioning performance in urban environment","Abstract":"The observation conditions have a significant influence on the positioning performance.

Yet thorough investigations into how three-dimensional (3D) architectural patterns influence urban thermal conditions collectively and individually are limited. This study bridges this gap by adopting a machine learning method, boosted regression tree (BRT), to analyze the relative influences and marginal effects of 3D urban architecture on land surface temperature (LST). Ten architectural metrics are incorporated to describe the composition and configuration of 3D architectural patterns at a neighborhood scale in the typical megacity of Shanghai. The results show that in summer, the building coverage ratio (BCR), mean architecture height (MAH), mean architecture height standard deviation (AHSD) and mean architecture projection area (MAPA) are the most influential factors, with relative contributions of 39.3%, 16.5%, 12.3% and 10.4%, respectively. The regulation amplitudes (\u0394T) of the dominant metrics for the neighborhood average LST temperature are 2.7 \u00b0C, 0.9 \u00b0C, 0.6 \u00b0C, and 0.6 \u00b0C, respectively. Moreover, with the LST, the BCR exhibits a monotonic positive correlation, the MAH and AHSD show a stepwise negative correlation, and the MAPA shows a combination of positive and negative correlation. It is generally recommended to decrease the development intensity and architectural base area, while increase the building height and roughness to improve the urban thermal conditions at the neighborhood scale. The dominant contributors and related marginal effects are generally consistent across different seasons. These findings can provide quantitative insights for mitigating the LST effects via rational design and management of 3D architectural patterns. Given the distinctive insights provided, the BRT method is recommended for disentangling the relationship between LST and environmental variables in upcoming studies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"3D architectural pattern; Boosted regression tree (BRT); Landscape metrics; Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI)","Authors":"Sun F., Liu M., Wang Y., Wang H., Che Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jclepro.2020.120706","x":-5.7199997902,"y":6.4099998474,"KeyPhrases":["urban thermal condition","regression tree","architecture height","3D urban architecture","architectural pattern influence"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban thermal condition","score":0.6530460119},{"key-phrase":"3D urban architecture","score":0.5069329143},{"key-phrase":"Urban architecture","score":0.4890832603},{"key-phrase":"urban heat island","score":0.4695544243},{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.4374886155},{"key-phrase":"architecture height","score":0.3993287683},{"key-phrase":"building height","score":0.3880251646},{"key-phrase":"architectural pattern influence","score":0.3631362915},{"key-phrase":"regression tree","score":0.3589198589},{"key-phrase":"architectural base area","score":0.3491224647},{"key-phrase":"3D architectural pattern","score":0.3479715884},{"key-phrase":"building coverage ratio","score":0.3209268451},{"key-phrase":"architectural","score":0.3099030256},{"key-phrase":"architecture projection area","score":0.2963223755},{"key-phrase":"typical megacity","score":0.2289018929},{"key-phrase":"average LST temperature","score":0.2037114203},{"key-phrase":"rational design","score":0.2004632354},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.1962586492},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood scale","score":0.1307032406},{"key-phrase":"study bridges","score":0.1228593141},{"key-phrase":"development intensity","score":0.1134490371},{"key-phrase":"environmental variable","score":0.112981081},{"key-phrase":"relative influence","score":0.1104632467},{"key-phrase":"positive and negative correlation","score":0.0940632746},{"key-phrase":"influential factor","score":0.09324269},{"key-phrase":"quantitative insight","score":0.0880886018},{"key-phrase":"marginal effect","score":0.0701840594},{"key-phrase":"LST effect","score":0.0623282641},{"key-phrase":"monotonic positive correlation","score":0.0504069403},{"key-phrase":"standard deviation","score":0.0475625172},{"key-phrase":"relative contribution","score":0.0436229557},{"key-phrase":"different season","score":0.0411610901},{"key-phrase":"stepwise negative correlation","score":0.0407513417},{"key-phrase":"BRT method","score":0.040181227},{"key-phrase":"dominant contributor","score":0.0335047618},{"key-phrase":"LST","score":0.0259478167},{"key-phrase":"important contributor","score":0.0062675215},{"key-phrase":"thorough investigation","score":-0.018694818},{"key-phrase":"regulation amplitude","score":-0.0197517499},{"key-phrase":"distinctive insight","score":-0.0294738971},{"key-phrase":"upcoming study","score":-0.0312657952}]},{"Cluster":26,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":248,"Cited by":15.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Comparison of random forest model and frequency ratio model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in Yunyang county (Chongqing, China)","Abstract":"To compare the random forest (RF) model and the frequency ratio (FR) model for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), this research selected Yunyang Country as the study area for its frequent natural disasters; especially landslides. A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

The primary focus of this research is to leverage the abundance of trajectory data to automatically and accurately learn latent semantic relationships between different geographical areas (e.g., semantically correlated neighborhoods of a city) as revealed by patterns of moving objects over time. While previous studies have utilized trajectories for this type of analysis at the level of a single geographical area, the results cannot be easily generalized to inform comparative analysis of different geographical areas. In this paper, we study this problem systematically. First, we present a method that utilizes trajectories to learn low-dimensional representations of geographical areas in an embedded space. Then, we develop a statistical method that allows to quantify the degree to which real trajectories deviate from a theoretical null model. The method allows to (a) distinguish geographical proximity to semantic proximity, and (b) inform a comparative analysis of two (or more) models obtained by trajectories defined on different geographical areas. This deep analysis can improve our understanding of how space is perceived by individuals and inform better decisions of urban planning. Our experimental evaluation aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed statistical method in two large-scale real-world data sets coming from the New York City and the city of Porto, Portugal, respectively. The methods we present are generic and can be utilized to inform a number of useful applications, ranging from location-based services, such as point-of-interest recommendations, to finding semantic relationships between different cities. \u00a9 2020 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Network representation learning; Spatial databases; Statistical inference; Trajectory data mining","Authors":"Mehmood S., Papagelis M.","DOI":"10.1109\/MDM48529.2020.00032","x":5.55,"y":-3.32,"KeyPhrases":["Mining trajectory data","latent semantic relationship","urban planning","deep analysis","crowd behavior"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Mining trajectory data","score":0.6427499056},{"key-phrase":"trajectory data","score":0.4847477376},{"key-phrase":"semantic proximity","score":0.446616888},{"key-phrase":"latent semantic relationship","score":0.4280309677},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4057767391},{"key-phrase":"geographical proximity","score":0.3805866241},{"key-phrase":"trajectory","score":0.3586291075},{"key-phrase":"real trajectory","score":0.3479655683},{"key-phrase":"deep analysis","score":0.3459190428},{"key-phrase":"real-world data","score":0.3339159787},{"key-phrase":"geographical","score":0.3113339245},{"key-phrase":"different geographical area","score":0.2974969149},{"key-phrase":"geographical area","score":0.2922291756},{"key-phrase":"semantic relationship","score":0.2903749347},{"key-phrase":"low-dimensional representation","score":0.2892405391},{"key-phrase":"transportation system","score":0.2752322555},{"key-phrase":"different city","score":0.2718406618},{"key-phrase":"single geographical area","score":0.270573318},{"key-phrase":"social network","score":0.2414300442},{"key-phrase":"interesting pattern","score":0.2188020498},{"key-phrase":"crowd behavior","score":0.2148338854},{"key-phrase":"interest recommendation","score":0.205222398},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.1743976921},{"key-phrase":"statistical method","score":0.1683440059},{"key-phrase":"useful application","score":0.1626508534},{"key-phrase":"research interest","score":0.15589571},{"key-phrase":"comparative analysis","score":0.1518591642},{"key-phrase":"previous study","score":0.0694577247},{"key-phrase":"theoretical null model","score":0.0684988499},{"key-phrase":"broad range","score":0.0602201037},{"key-phrase":"primary focus","score":0.0283321999},{"key-phrase":"experimental evaluation aim","score":-0.0134961111}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":250,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Design of machine learning model for Urban planning and management improvement","Abstract":"With the aid of artificial intelligence, this paper builds a machine learning model with the KNN algorithm to optimize the traditional method of urban planning and management (UPM). The optimization is realized through two steps. First, the relevant theories of the updated UPM of livelihood oriented UPM (LOUPM) are explored for the later machine learning architecture design. People's livelihood has a great influence on UPM. Livelihood orientation makes the complex UPM even more complicated due to diverse living needs of citizens. This paper analyzes the deeper relationship between the people's livelihood and UPM, systematically studies the function and connotation of the people's livelihood behavior, and profoundly discusses current contradictions and restraining factors. Second, based on a better understanding of LOUPM, this paper further proposes an artificial intelligence approach to select most related factors to optimize UPM from databases. In the first paper of this series, in the analysis of the relevant UPM theories, three scopes of LOUPM are concluded to be the evaluation of data sets: authority, time, and space. Then, this paper continues to design a software model with the KNN algorithm to evaluate the urban plans and generates optimization advice for the user. Based on this research, it is possible to explore LOUPM. In order to make every effort to seek ways and methods to meet the challenge of the LOUPM in the new period, and by introducing a creative computing approach of government management and social governance, this article can contribute to the growing demand of China's urbanization process. \u00a9 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.

Previous studies have generally divided study areas into several sub-areas with similar features by artificial or clustering algorithms and then developed models for these sub-areas separately using statistical methods. These approaches have drawbacks due to their subjectivity and uncertainty. In this paper, we present a study of population spatialization in Beijing City, China based on multisource remote sensing data and town-level population census data. Six predictive algorithms were compared for estimating population using the spatial variables derived from The National Polar-Orbiting Partnership\/ Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP\/VIIRS) night-time light and other remote sensing data. Random forest achieved the highest accuracy and therefore was employed for population spatialization. Feature selection was performed to determine the optimal variable combinations for population modeling by random forest. Cross-validation results indicated that the developed model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2129.52 people\/km2 and a R2 of 0.63. The gridded population density in Beijing at a spatial resolution of 500 m produced by the random forest model was also adjusted to be consistent with the census population at the town scale. By comparison with Google Earth high-resolution images, the remotely-sensed population was qualitatively validated at the intra-town scale. Validation results indicated that remotely sensed results can effectively depict the spatial distribution of population within town-level districts. This study provides a valuable reference for urban planning, public health and disaster prevention in Beijing, and a reference for population mapping in other cities. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Beijing; Population spatialization; Random forest; Remote sensing","Authors":"He M., Xu Y., Li N.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12121910","x":9.01,"y":-3.54,"KeyPhrases":["population spatialization","random forest model","Beijing City","Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"population spatialization","score":0.5484604239},{"key-phrase":"population mapping","score":0.5221607685},{"key-phrase":"random forest model","score":0.4758934975},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4371126592},{"key-phrase":"Random forest","score":0.4285438359},{"key-phrase":"gridded population density","score":0.3950420916},{"key-phrase":"level population census","score":0.389239192},{"key-phrase":"population modeling","score":0.3826566041},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.3719852567},{"key-phrase":"census population","score":0.3690707684},{"key-phrase":"population","score":0.3267892003},{"key-phrase":"clustering algorithm","score":0.3220118284},{"key-phrase":"spatialization","score":0.3120956123},{"key-phrase":"Feature selection","score":0.2855079174},{"key-phrase":"Google Earth","score":0.2684049904},{"key-phrase":"predictive algorithm","score":0.2572056651},{"key-phrase":"statistical method","score":0.2496556342},{"key-phrase":"Beijing City","score":0.2493783236},{"key-phrase":"intra-town scale","score":0.2448422611},{"key-phrase":"town scale","score":0.2405907214},{"key-phrase":"other city","score":0.2188701928},{"key-phrase":"spatial resolution","score":0.2035094202},{"key-phrase":"several sub-areas","score":0.1897473335},{"key-phrase":"Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer","score":0.1872508377},{"key-phrase":"disaster prevention","score":0.1686861068},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1409727633},{"key-phrase":"level district","score":0.1381342709},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution image","score":0.118348971},{"key-phrase":"National Polar","score":0.1062520072},{"key-phrase":"public health","score":0.1055570543},{"key-phrase":"similar feature","score":0.0865629464},{"key-phrase":"Cross-validation result","score":0.0690185055},{"key-phrase":"Orbiting Partnership","score":0.0638636872},{"key-phrase":"optimal variable combination","score":0.060578078},{"key-phrase":"mean absolute error","score":0.0587485507},{"key-phrase":"Validation result","score":0.0510608144},{"key-phrase":"time light","score":0.0445605293},{"key-phrase":"Previous study","score":0.032020282},{"key-phrase":"valuable reference","score":-0.0130824326}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":252,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Comparative assessment of machine learning methods for urban vegetation mapping using multitemporal Sentinel-1 imagery","Abstract":"Mapping of green vegetation in urban areas using remote sensing techniques can be used as a tool for integrated spatial planning to deal with urban challenges. In this context, multitemporal (MT) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have not been equally investigated, as compared to optical satellite data. This research compared various machine learning methods using single-date and MT Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery. The research was focused on vegetation mapping in urban areas across Europe. Urban vegetation was classified using six classifiers-random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost. M1 (AB), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Whereas, SVM showed the best performance in the single-date image analysis, the MLP classifier yielded the highest overall accuracy in the MT classification scenario. Mean overall accuracy (OA) values for all machine learning methods increased from 57% to 77% with speckle filtering. Using MT SAR data, i.e., three and five S1 imagery, an additional increase in the OA of 8.59% and 13.66% occurred, respectively. Additionally, using three and five S1 imagery for classification, the F1 measure for forest and low vegetation land-cover class exceeded 90%.

Such incidents can cause massive damage to people, properties, and infrastructure. Therefore, proper rockfall hazard assessment methods are required to save lives and provide a guide for the development of an area. The aim of this research is to develop a method for rockfall hazard assessment at two different scales (regional and local). A high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) technique was utilized to derive an accurate digital terrain model (DTM); next, a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) was used to capture the topography of the two most critical areas within the study area. A staking machine-learning model based on different classifiers, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), was optimized and employed to determine rockfall probability by utilizing various rockfall conditioning factors. A developed 3D rockfall kinematic model was used to obtain rockfall trajectories, velocity, frequency, bouncing height, kinetic energy, and impact location. Next, a spatial model combined with a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) integrated in the Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed to assess rockfall hazard in two different areas in Ipoh, Malaysia. Additionally, mitigation processes were suggested and assessed to provide a comprehensive information for urban planning management. The results show that, the stacking random forest-k-nearest neighbor (RF-KNN) model is the best hybrid model compared to other tested models with an accuracy of 89%, 86%, and 87% based on training, validation, and cross-validation datasets, respectively. The three-dimension rockfall kinematic model was calibrated with an accuracy of 93% and 95% for the two study areas and subsequently the rockfall trajectories and their characteristics were derived. The assessment of the suggested mitigation processes proves that the proposed methods can reduce or eliminate rockfall hazard in these areas. According to the results, the proposed method can be generalized and applied in other geographical places to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive rockfall hazard assessment. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"3D kinematic modeling; GIS model; LiDAR; Machine learning; Rockfall hazard","Authors":"Fanos A.M., Pradhan B., Alamri A., Lee C.-W.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12111755","x":12.7299995422,"y":3.4400000572,"KeyPhrases":["rockfall hazard assessment","support vector machine","urban planning management","high-resolution airborne laser scanning","mountainous and hilly region"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"rockfall hazard assessment","score":0.6628149748},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive rockfall hazard","score":0.5967279673},{"key-phrase":"proper rockfall hazard","score":0.5617935658},{"key-phrase":"rockfall hazard","score":0.5417667627},{"key-phrase":"rockfall probability","score":0.5102745295},{"key-phrase":"rockfall trajectory","score":0.4774113894},{"key-phrase":"various rockfall conditioning","score":0.4200710356},{"key-phrase":"developed 3D rockfall","score":0.4136401117},{"key-phrase":"high and steep terrain","score":0.4042996764},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.392336607},{"key-phrase":"dimension rockfall","score":0.3841246367},{"key-phrase":"accurate digital terrain model","score":0.3828443885},{"key-phrase":"Geographic Information System","score":0.3791926205},{"key-phrase":"fuzzy analytical hierarchy process","score":0.3575139642},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.3526691198},{"key-phrase":"urban planning management","score":0.3418893516},{"key-phrase":"mountainous and hilly region","score":0.3383819461},{"key-phrase":"rockfall","score":0.3353449702},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.3344225287},{"key-phrase":"spatial model","score":0.3174253702},{"key-phrase":"different classifier","score":0.2861365974},{"key-phrase":"impact location","score":0.2802089155},{"key-phrase":"logistic regression","score":0.2733083069},{"key-phrase":"learning model","score":0.2680978179},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution airborne laser scanning","score":0.2116536051},{"key-phrase":"terrestrial laser scanner","score":0.2068002522},{"key-phrase":"other geographical place","score":0.1978018731},{"key-phrase":"kinematic model","score":0.186229378},{"key-phrase":"assessment method","score":0.1812930107},{"key-phrase":"hazardous phenomenon","score":0.1606491059},{"key-phrase":"different area","score":0.1587851644},{"key-phrase":"critical area","score":0.1519153118},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1496210992},{"key-phrase":"mitigation process","score":0.1314009875},{"key-phrase":"mitigation processes","score":0.1227959096},{"key-phrase":"cross-validation datasets","score":0.1217830628},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.1135256141},{"key-phrase":"kinetic energy","score":0.1127991751},{"key-phrase":"hybrid model","score":0.0977017432},{"key-phrase":"hazard","score":0.0905672014},{"key-phrase":"massive damage","score":0.0821681097},{"key-phrase":"different scale","score":0.0774120092},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive information","score":0.0733405054},{"key-phrase":"Such incident","score":0.0526260883},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0313760191}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":254,"Cited by":28.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Local climate zone mapping as remote sensing scene classification using deep learning: A case study of metropolitan China","Abstract":"China, with the world's largest population, has gone through rapid development in the last forty years and now has over 800 million urban citizens. Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400\u20131,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48\u00d748 corresponding to 480\u00d7480 m2) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10\u00d710) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32\u00d732 to 64\u00d764 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application. \u00a9 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Much has been speculated, but not much has been tested regarding the impacts of ride-sourcing services on the transportation system. In this study, we examine the relationship between ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership of households, by using the most up-to-date (2017) national household travel survey data. To better capture the effect of ride-sourcing services on vehicle ownership, we controlled for the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of households and built environment variables, i.e., density, diversity, design, and distance to transit. Two approaches were used to model vehicle ownership: a probabilistic or inferential model (i.e., multilevel Poisson), and a machine learning method (i.e., random forest). This is the first study to utilize such advanced methods to model vehicle ownership and capture non-linear relationships, using the largest sample of household travel records ever assembled for such a study. The results suggest that there is a negative correlation between using ride-sourcing services and vehicle ownership. Vehicle ownership is also negatively associated with the number of years Uber, as the biggest ride-sourcing service, has operated in a county. The relative contributions of ride-sourcing variables, however, are very limited compared to other variables controlled in this study which makes intuitive sense. For urban planning and design practices, this study suggests that the probability of car shedding will increase if the usage of ride-sourcing services becomes a habit, these services become more available, and built environments become more dense, connected, and transit-served. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Multilevel modeling; Random forest; Ride-sourcing services; Uber; Vehicle ownership","Authors":"Sabouri S., Brewer S., Ewing R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2020.103797","x":12.7899999619,"y":1.4600000381,"KeyPhrases":["vehicle ownership","random forest","urban planning","multilevel Poisson","survey data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"vehicle ownership","score":0.5225712061},{"key-phrase":"transportation system","score":0.3941396475},{"key-phrase":"survey data","score":0.3903579712},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3651973605},{"key-phrase":"year Uber","score":0.3635199368},{"key-phrase":"ride","score":0.3603111506},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.3322592974},{"key-phrase":"national household travel","score":0.3138129711},{"key-phrase":"household travel record","score":0.3077512383},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic characteristic","score":0.2789079547},{"key-phrase":"inferential model","score":0.2735523582},{"key-phrase":"car shedding","score":0.2734635472},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.2557030618},{"key-phrase":"sourcing","score":0.2555045784},{"key-phrase":"multilevel Poisson","score":0.2254702449},{"key-phrase":"sourcing service","score":0.1559290439},{"key-phrase":"intuitive sense","score":0.146884501},{"key-phrase":"relative contribution","score":0.1437443048},{"key-phrase":"design practice","score":0.1199107021},{"key-phrase":"negative correlation","score":0.1193110496},{"key-phrase":"non-linear relationship","score":0.1130369529},{"key-phrase":"such advanced method","score":0.0528061576},{"key-phrase":"first study","score":0.0463123471}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":256,"Cited by":13.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"An agent-based learning-embedded model (ABM-learning) for urban land use planning: A case study of residential land growth simulation in Shenzhen, China","Abstract":"A forward-looking urban land use plan is crucial to a city's sustainability, which requires a deep understanding of human-environment interactions between different domains, and modelling them soundly. One of the key challenges of modelling these interactions is to understand and model how human individuals make and develop their location decisions by learning that then shape urban land-use patterns. To investigate this issue, we have constructed an extended experience-weighted attraction learning model to represent the human agents\u2019 learning when they make location decisions. Consequently, we propose and have developed an agent-based learning-embedded model (ABM-learning) for residential land growth simulation that incorporates a learning model, a decision-making model, a land use conversion model and the constraint of urban land use master plan. The proposed model was used for a simulation of the residential land growth in Shenzhen city, China. By validating the model against empirical data, the results showed that the site-specific accuracy of the model has been improved when embedding learning model. The analysis on the simulation accuracies has proved the argument that modelling individual-level learning matters in the agent's decision model and the agent-based models. We also applied the model to predict residential land growth in Shenzhen from 2015 to 2035, and the result can be a reference for land-use allocation in detailed planning of Shenzhen.

This study presents a reliable method that reveals the structure of cities mainly based on clustering analysis using a new similarity measure. Several previous studies have used well-known clustering algorithms in machine learning fields, such as k-means clustering based on temporal mobility patterns of regions, whereas other studies have applied community detection algorithms on networks that depict traffic flows. However, the former does not reflect spatial interactions among places or areas, and the latter groups' places or areas with different land uses into the same cluster. To address these issues in existing approaches, this study proposes a new similarity method that considers not only temporal mobility patterns of areas but also spatial interactions with other areas. Moreover, the study combines spectral clustering repeated several times with hierarchical clustering to obtain a reliable structure that keeps the contiguity of clusters and determine the hierarchy of different areal units.

Numerous methods have been proposed to identify urban land use, in which points of interest (POI) data is widely used, and sometimes other data source like GPS trajectories is incorporated. However, previous works have hardly fully utilized the global spatial information contained in the POI data, or ignored correlations between features when integrating multiple data source, so resulting in information loss. In this study, we propose an integrated framework titled Region2vec to detect urban land use type by combining POI and mobile phone data. First, POI-based region embeddings are generated by applying Glove model and LDA model to mine the global spatial information and land use topic distributions respectively. The mobile phone data is utilized to generate human activity pattern-based embeddings. Then a similarity matrix is constructed according to POI-based and activity pattern-based embeddings. Finally, the similarity measures are regarded as clustering features to extract the urban land use results. Experiments are implemented and compared with other urban land use algorithms based on data in Sanya, China. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This research can provide effective information support for urban planning. \u00a9 2020 ACM.","Author Keywords":"machine learning; point of interest; region2vec; Urban land use","Authors":"Xiang M.","DOI":"10.1145\/3404555.3404613","x":5.65,"y":-3.47,"KeyPhrases":["urban land use","region embeddings","activity pattern","clustering feature","POI data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land use","score":0.5368433595},{"key-phrase":"other urban land use","score":0.492115736},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4509603679},{"key-phrase":"region embeddings","score":0.408520937},{"key-phrase":"land use topic","score":0.4045804441},{"key-phrase":"global spatial information","score":0.3966584206},{"key-phrase":"clustering feature","score":0.3814113438},{"key-phrase":"human activity pattern","score":0.3596394062},{"key-phrase":"embeddings","score":0.3266555667},{"key-phrase":"activity pattern","score":0.314160347},{"key-phrase":"POI data","score":0.3103153706},{"key-phrase":"similarity measure","score":0.3080666065},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone data","score":0.2795456946},{"key-phrase":"similarity matrix","score":0.25839293},{"key-phrase":"research hotspot","score":0.2509452701},{"key-phrase":"POI","score":0.2097007036},{"key-phrase":"LDA model","score":0.1844491214},{"key-phrase":"other data source","score":0.1408257484},{"key-phrase":"GPS trajectory","score":0.1235281825},{"key-phrase":"multiple data source","score":0.1221794635},{"key-phrase":"information loss","score":0.1147996187},{"key-phrase":"Glove model","score":0.0904029831},{"key-phrase":"Numerous method","score":0.0847258717},{"key-phrase":"effective information support","score":0.0691721216},{"key-phrase":"previous work","score":0.0655126572},{"key-phrase":"integrated framework","score":0.0651330352}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":259,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A locally-constrained YOLO framework for detecting small and densely-distributed building footprints","Abstract":"Building footprints are among the most predominant features in urban areas, and provide valuable information for urban planning, solar energy suitability analysis, etc. We aim to automatically and rapidly identify building footprints by leveraging deep learning techniques and the increased availability of remote sensing datasets at high spatial resolution. The task is computationally challenging due to the use of large training datasets and large number of parameters. In related work, You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art deep learning framework for object detection. However, YOLO is limited in its capacity to identify small objects that appear in groups, which is the case for building footprints. We propose a LOcally-COnstrained (LOCO) You-Only-Look-Once framework to detect small and densely-distributed building footprints. LOCO is a variant of YOLO. Its layer architecture is determined by the spatial characteristics of building footprints and it uses a constrained regression modeling to improve the robustness of building size predictions. We also present an invariant augmentation based voting scheme to further improve the precision in the prediction phase.

The first mapping results of essential urban land use categories (EULUC) in China for 2018 have been recently released. However, such kind of national maps may not sufficiently meet the growing demand for regional analysis. To address this shortcoming, here we proposed a segmentation-based framework named EULUC-seg to improve the mapping results of EULUC at the city scale. An object-based segmentation approach was first applied to generate the basic mapping units within urban parcels. Multiple features derived from high-resolution remotely sensed and social sensing data were updated and then recalculated within each unit. Random forest was adopted as the machine learning algorithm for classifying urban land use into five Level I classes and twelve Level II classes. Finally, an accuracy assessment was carried out based on a collection of manually interpreted samples. Results showed that our derived map achieved an overall accuracy of 87.58% for Level I, and 73.53% for Level II. The accurate and refined map of EULUC-seg is expected to better support various applications in the future. \u00a9 2020, by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Ningbo; Segmentation; Urban land use","Authors":"Tu Y., Chen B., Zhang T., Xu B.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12071058","x":9.25,"y":-4.01,"KeyPhrases":["urban land use","Random forest","accurate and refined map","segmentation approach","EULUC"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land use","score":0.5745382905},{"key-phrase":"essential urban land use","score":0.563835144},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4839793444},{"key-phrase":"Random forest","score":0.416441679},{"key-phrase":"accurate and refined map","score":0.3888719082},{"key-phrase":"urban parcel","score":0.3759506345},{"key-phrase":"national map","score":0.3089330792},{"key-phrase":"regional analysis","score":0.3030519485},{"key-phrase":"city scale","score":0.2988732457},{"key-phrase":"segmentation approach","score":0.2831994891},{"key-phrase":"basic mapping unit","score":0.2329441607},{"key-phrase":"mapping result","score":0.1908029318},{"key-phrase":"first mapping result","score":0.175524801},{"key-phrase":"accuracy assessment","score":0.1650300324},{"key-phrase":"decision support","score":0.1441306025},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1267569065},{"key-phrase":"resource allocation","score":0.1142376959},{"key-phrase":"Multiple feature","score":0.113268286},{"key-phrase":"various application","score":0.0971011296},{"key-phrase":"EULUC","score":0.0668149665},{"key-phrase":"seg","score":0.0663255006},{"key-phrase":"great importance","score":0.0302520692},{"key-phrase":"such kind","score":-0.035133291}]},{"Cluster":5,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":261,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Crosstown traffic - supervised prediction of impact of planned special events on urban traffic","Abstract":"Large-scale planned special events in cities including concerts, football games and fairs can significantly impact urban mobility.

Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal. \u00a9 2020 by the author.","Author Keywords":"Cropland loss; Machine learning models; Markov chain; Urban expansion","Authors":"Rimal B., Sloan S., Keshtkar H., Sharma R., Rijal S., Shrestha U.B.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12040628","x":-5.4000000954,"y":6.6100001335,"KeyPhrases":["agricultural and forested land","artificial neural network","urban expansion","Nepal's Tarai region","Landsat satellite imagery"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"agricultural and forested land","score":0.4739762247},{"key-phrase":"peri-urban area","score":0.4663802683},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion","score":0.4292027354},{"key-phrase":"Nepal's Tarai region","score":0.4208373427},{"key-phrase":"Landsat satellite imagery","score":0.3985785842},{"key-phrase":"effective land","score":0.3966219425},{"key-phrase":"prime agricultural land","score":0.3963128328},{"key-phrase":"agricultural conversion","score":0.392442137},{"key-phrase":"fertile Tarai region","score":0.3884276748},{"key-phrase":"populous area","score":0.3835888803},{"key-phrase":"agricultural cover","score":0.3718770742},{"key-phrase":"spatial model","score":0.3604328036},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.3283289671},{"key-phrase":"historical land","score":0.322789073},{"key-phrase":"agricultural","score":0.312075913},{"key-phrase":"high demographic growth","score":0.3118259907},{"key-phrase":"nepal","score":0.310916692},{"key-phrase":"poor land","score":0.3098286688},{"key-phrase":"societal and environmental sustainability","score":0.2879180908},{"key-phrase":"Such land","score":0.2570801973},{"key-phrase":"sustainable outcome","score":0.244151637},{"key-phrase":"South Asia","score":0.2276409864},{"key-phrase":"use planning","score":0.2066969573},{"key-phrase":"Urban cover","score":0.2001131475},{"key-phrase":"future trends","score":0.1878331751},{"key-phrase":"Markov chain","score":0.1641824543},{"key-phrase":"insecure country","score":0.160373956},{"key-phrase":"historical trend","score":0.1533020437},{"key-phrase":"use change","score":0.1448257416},{"key-phrase":"Such unplanned loss","score":0.1196704879},{"key-phrase":"cover change","score":0.1110177934},{"key-phrase":"other factors","score":0.0990647525},{"key-phrase":"negative implication","score":0.0849284232},{"key-phrase":"unprecedented rate","score":0.0815370232},{"key-phrase":"serious concern","score":-0.0198012143}]},{"Cluster":31,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":266,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Resilient structural systems created by research","Abstract":"Research is essential for developing new ideas creating resilient structures that have extended and predicted life cycles.

However, with COVID-19 aviation was hard hit. This, along with its contribution to global warming, has led to louder calls to limit its use. This situation emphasizes how urban planners and technologists could contribute to understanding and responding to this change. This paper explores a novel workflow of performing image-based machine learning (ML) on satellite images of over 1.000 world airports that were algonthmically collated using European Space Agency Sentinel2 API. From these, the top 350 United States airports were analyzed with land use parameters extracted around the airport using computer vision, which were mapped against their passenger footfall numbers. The results demonstrate a scalable approach to identify how easy and beneficial it would be for certain airports to expand or contract and how this would impact the surrounding urban environment in terms of pollution and congestion. The generic nature of this workflow makes it possible to potentially extend this method to any large infrastructure and compare and analyze specific features across a large number of images while being able to understand the same feature through time. This is critical in answering key typology-based urban design challenges at a higher level and without needing to perform on-ground studies, which could be expensive and time-consuming. \u00a9 Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

In this research, we use an image-based neural network to explore the relationship between the built environment and the activity of bicyclists in that environment. The generative model can produce heat maps that can be used to predict quantitatively the cycling and running activity in a given area, and then use urban design to enhance urban vitality in that area. In the machine learning model, the input image is a plan view of the built environment, and the output image is a heat map showing certain activities in the corresponding area. After it is trained, the model yields output (the predicted heat map) at an acceptable level of accuracy. The heat map shows the levels and conditions of the subject activity in different sections of the built environment. Thus, the predicted results can help identify where regional vitality can be improved. Using this method, designers can not only predict the behavioral heat distribution but also examine the different interactions between behaviors and aspects of the environment. The extent to which factors might influence behaviors is also studied by generating a heat map of the modified plan. In addition to the potential applications of this approach, its limitations and areas for improvement are also proposed. \u00a9 Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

This paper further proposes a new method for design based on the resulting model, where a designer can identify areas of a city tied to certain perceptual qualities and generate speculative street scenes optimized for their predicted saliency on labels of human experience.This work extends Kevin Lynch's Image of the City with deep learning: training an image classification model to recognize Lynch's five elements of the city image, using Lynch's original photographs and diagrams of Boston to construct labeled training data alongside new imagery of the same locations. This new city image revitalizes past attempts to quantify the human perception of urban form and improve urban design. A designer can search and map the data set to understand spatial opportunities and predict the quality of imagined designs through a dynamic process of collage, model inference, and adaptation.Within a larger practice of design, this work suggests that the curation of archival records, computer science techniques, and theoretical principles of urbanism might be integrated into a single craft.

Previous research has found numerous correlations between the built environment and both physical and mental health outcomes-suggesting that the design of our cities may have significant impacts on human health. Developing methods of analysis that can provide insight on the correlations between the built environment and human health could help the allied design disciplines shape our cities in ways that promote human health. This research addresses these issues and contributes knowledge on the use of deep learning (DL) methods for urban analysis and mental health, specifically anxiety. Mental health disorders, such as anxiety, have been estimated to account for the largest proportion of global disease burden. The methods presented allow architects, planners, and urban designers to make use of large remote-sensing datasets (e.g.. satellite and aerial images) for design workflows involving analysis and generative design tasks. The research also contributes insight on correlations between anxiety prevalence and specific urban design features-providing actionable intelligence for the planning and design of the urban fabric. \u00a9 Proceedings of the 40th Annual Conference of the Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture: Distributed Proximities, ACADIA 2020.

Together with vast amount of data of urban phenomena and new lifestyles emerging from virtuality and cybernetic systems, this \u2018smartification\u2019 makes the planning and analyses more challenging while providing new tools to respond to them. In this article I propose a project for better understanding and guiding the future smart city based on dynamic urban theories such as those studying complex adaptive systems, urban morphology, urban economy and mobility systems. I argue that we need to carry out empirical research on ongoing change to learn about novel, becoming spatial and functional patterns in the city, and apply both theories and imaginary visions to be able to grasp the likely qualitative transition in humans\u2019 life following the ubiquitous use of technology. The project is built around three coupled modules, urban space, mobility and urban economics, and it will be carried out in the city of Tallinn, Estonia.

However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geocontextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. To enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation, a multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions, forcing the embeddings to encapsulate effective representation for flow prediction. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model using real-world dataset from New York City and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against the state of the art.

Since only a few satellite sensors can take fine-resolution thermal infrared images at night, such images are rather scarce. Downscaling of coarse-resolution LST images is a potential method for obtaining high-resolution LST images. However, downscaling methods have been mostly proposed for daytime LST images. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of methods that combine multiple explanatory variables and machine learning algorithms for downscaling coarse-resolution nighttime LST images in urban areas. Verification showed that the errors in the downscaling results were acceptable (mean absolute errors within 2 K). The resulting images could depict the spatial pattern of night LST in the study area in great detail. It was demonstrated that visible-near infrared images taken in the daytime could be used for downscaling of nighttime LST images, the rationality of which was deduced. It was also demonstrated that the performance of the spectral explanatory variables in nighttime LST downscalingwas not lower than that of the mechanism explanatory variables. This method has high application value in many academic and practical efforts, such as land-atmosphere interface radiation budget studies, suitability assessments of human settlement, and urban environmental planning. \u00a9 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Managing the urban economy needs to consider environmental restrictions, environmental monitoring tasks, engineering facilities, and transport. Operational control over the urban environment and the surrounding area can be produced using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the collected data can be processed using a wide range of software and hardware technologies related to the field of artificial intelligence. However, along with any fairly new technology, intelligent unmanned technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. Strengths are mobility and efficiency, relative cheapness, the possibility of a high degree of automation, whereas weaknesses are short flight time, dependence on weather conditions, the certain outstanding tasks of data management and processing. This paper considers the possibilities of using intelligent unmanned technologies based on UAVs for solving the problems of monitoring the urban environment of the Kazakhstan megalopolises. Consideration is also being given to the scope for extending possibilities of applying these technologies to the field of environmental monitoring, monitoring of hazardous geological processes, technical constructions and vehicles. Furthermore, technological and economic issues, as well as necessary data processing technologies, are discussed. The economic effect of the use of IUVAT is estimated at $ 70-200 million, but it requires solving a set of data processing, control and technical problems. \u00a9 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; Environmental pollution monitoring; Machine learning; Monitoring hazardous geological and geophysical processes; Monitoring of technical and engineering constructions; Multi-Criteria decision support systems; Smart city; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Urban environment","Authors":"Mukhamediev R., Kuchin Y., Yakunin K., Symagulov A., Ospanova M., Assanov I., Yelis M.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-65218-0_26","x":4.1700000763,"y":2.1300001144,"KeyPhrases":["intelligent unmanned technology","urban economy","environmental monitoring task","Kazakhstan megalopolis","short flight time"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"intelligent unmanned technology","score":0.6315462589},{"key-phrase":"unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.5132133961},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4214608073},{"key-phrase":"environmental monitoring","score":0.4001153111},{"key-phrase":"environmental monitoring task","score":0.3965160251},{"key-phrase":"Kazakhstan megalopolis","score":0.3808337748},{"key-phrase":"urban economy","score":0.3682867885},{"key-phrase":"data processing","score":0.3356136084},{"key-phrase":"necessary data processing","score":0.3120588362},{"key-phrase":"artificial intelligence","score":0.2696176767},{"key-phrase":"technological and economic issue","score":0.2588843107},{"key-phrase":"data management","score":0.2561434507},{"key-phrase":"technical construction","score":0.2532133162},{"key-phrase":"Operational control","score":0.2509851456},{"key-phrase":"new management method","score":0.2215956897},{"key-phrase":"technology","score":0.2060749233},{"key-phrase":"new technology","score":0.2042811066},{"key-phrase":"hardware technology","score":0.198156774},{"key-phrase":"Sustainable development","score":0.1856882572},{"key-phrase":"engineering facility","score":0.1776407361},{"key-phrase":"hazardous geological process","score":0.1762874722},{"key-phrase":"technical problem","score":0.1611362249},{"key-phrase":"certain outstanding task","score":0.1532453299},{"key-phrase":"short flight time","score":0.143298462},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous data","score":0.1430967897},{"key-phrase":"economic effect","score":0.1222827509},{"key-phrase":"weather condition","score":0.1177353039},{"key-phrase":"environmental restriction","score":0.1121959984},{"key-phrase":"wide use","score":0.0614549927},{"key-phrase":"relative cheapness","score":0.0598534644},{"key-phrase":"large amount","score":0.0339798927},{"key-phrase":"high degree","score":0.0145813208},{"key-phrase":"wide range","score":-0.0034825727},{"key-phrase":"possibility","score":-0.0135899372}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":276,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Construction of landscape architecture art design based on streaming media data processing","Abstract":"In urban planning, the design of garden landscape is not a difficult thing, it needs to adopt effective design methods. Different ways of landscape design can add natural landscape to the urban ecosystem, and will not destroy the ecological environment, but will gradually improve the quality of the ecological environment. However, the design methods of landscape in urban planning in China are not perfect enough, there are many problems, and it is difficult to improve the ecological environment of the city. Therefore, in the process of urban planning, the relevant personnel should fully understand the design methods of landscape, and constantly innovate to create a quality living environment for people. In this paper, we propose the landscape architecture system based on mobile edge streaming media data processing. In the system, video surveillance system is mainly used to collect data, and the edge computing is the further processing of the inner connections. Especially, the stram data is analysed based on the machine learning models and the connection with the design is analysed. The experimental results prove robustness of the methodology.

Such signals cause major GNSS positioning (also known as \u201cNLOS multipath\u201d) errors. In this paper, a novel NLOS multipath detection technique using a machine-learning approach to improve the positioning accuracy in urban environments is proposed. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to a direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of an NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. To consider the change in shape of the correlation values of NLOS signals and their temporal variation, we propose a method for constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based NLOS discriminator. Furthermore, we propose a method for applying the NLOS probability, which is the output of the CNN, to the positioning calculation. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conducted NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We compared the proposed method with a method using a simple NN. As the experiment results indicate, the proposed method can correctly discriminate approximately 98% of NLOS multipath signals, and the discrimination rate of the proposed CNN-based method is higher than that of the simple NN-based approach. Furthermore, we improved the positioning accuracy from 34.1 to 1.6 m using the proposed method and concluded that the proposed approach can increase the positioning accuracy in urban environments. \u00a9 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

The existing techniques include the multi-sensor integration, 3D map aid, using a dual-polarized antenna, an omnidirectional camera aid are proposed to solve the classification problem. However, they all require external hardware or up-to-date map, which is expensive or impractical for mass-market applications. Consistency checking with the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is widely used for the detection of NLOS signals, but it is efficient only when the majority of the received signals are LOS signals. Machine learning methods, including the decision tree, the support vector machine (SVM) have been explored to classify LOS and NLOS with good accuracy. However, all current machine learning based method only utilize information within one epoch, all the inter-epoch information and data features in time series are lost, and the information of signal propagation in the complex urban environments is not fully manifested in the Rinex level observation and NMEA level observations in one single epoch. In this paper, a multivariate Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (MLSTM-FCN) based signal classification method is proposed. With the aid of the convolution layer and long short term memory block, this method handles the data features in both time domain and value domain. Six time series features of GNSS signal, including differenced C\/N0, time differenced ambiguity, double difference phase and pseudorange, phase and pseudorange consistency are analyzed and used as the input of the MLSTM-FCN. Datasets from two locations in the urban Calgary are collected, each of which is used for training and testing purposes respectively. The results reveal that, compared to the SVM classification method, the overall testing accuracy of the newly proposed classifier is improved from 93.00% to 95.97% for the Rinex level observation, and from 92.99% to 93.83 for the NMEA level observation. This improved classification accuracy brought by the proposed classifier is encouraging since it will enhance the robustness of the conventional GNSS positioning and the shadow matching based navigation system by reducing unbounded NLOS signal errors in urban environments and result in significant improvement in positioning accuracy. Compared to the SVM classifier aided single point positioning (SPP) test, the accuracy in the form of RMS of the MLSTM-FCN aided SPP test can be improved by 24.3%, 17.8% and 24.4% in the East, North and Up directions respectively, and the rate of the valid solution can be increased from 99.02% to 99.94%. The new method has the potential to be widely applied by various receiver types with the output of the raw observation or only with the NMEA observations output. \u00a9 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

The study utilized a modern machine learning computer vision algorithm in the urban build environment to simulate the process, which starts with the visual perception of the urban street landscape and ends with the human reaction to street vitality. By analyzing the optimized trained model, we tried to identify urban street vitality\u2019s visual features and evaluate their importance. A region around the Mochou Lake in Nanjing, China, was set as our study area. Seven investigators surveyed the area, recorded their evaluation score on each site\u2019s vitality level with a corresponding picture taken on site. A total of 370 pictures and recorded score pairs from 231 valid survey sites were used to train a convolutional neural network. After optimization, a deep neural network model with 43 layers, including 11 convolutional ones, was created. Heat maps were then used to identify the features which lead to high vitality score outputs. The spatial distributions of different types of feature entities were also analyzed to help identify the spatial effects. The study found that visual features, including human, construction site, shop front, and roadside\/walking pavement, are vital ones that correspond to the vitality of the urban street. The consistency of these critical features with traditional urban vitality features indicates the model had learned useful knowledge from the training process. Applying the trained model in urban planning practices can help to improve the city environment for better attraction of residents\u2019 activities and communications. \u00a9 2020 Wuhan University.

This research has benefited urban planning, logistics, animal migration understanding, and much more. Typically, the movement is captured as precise geographic coordinates and time stamps with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Although some research uses computational techniques to take advantage of implicit movement in descriptions of route directions, hiking paths, and historical exploration routes, innovation would accelerate with a large and diverse corpus. We created a corpus of sentences labeled as describing geographic movement or not and including the type of entity moving. Creating this corpus proved difficult without any comparable corpora to start with, high human labeling costs, and since movement can at times be interpreted differently. To overcome these challenges, we developed an iterative process employing hand labeling, crowd voting for confirmation, and machine learning to predict more labels. By merging advances in word embeddings with traditional machine learning models and model ensembling, prediction accuracy is at an acceptable level to produce a large silver-standard corpus despite the small gold-standard corpus training set. Our corpus will likely benefit computational processing of geography in text and spatial cognition, in addition to detection of movement. \u00a9 European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","Author Keywords":"Corpus; Crowdsourcing; Embeddings; Geographic movement; Machine learning; Spatial cognition; Text classification","Authors":"Pezanowski S., Mitra P.","DOI":null,"x":5.81,"y":-3.29,"KeyPhrases":["geographic movement","large and diverse corpus","time stamp","hand labeling","crowd voting"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"geographic movement","score":0.5197781324},{"key-phrase":"large and diverse corpus","score":0.442079246},{"key-phrase":"word embeddings","score":0.4158166647},{"key-phrase":"corpus","score":0.4046647549},{"key-phrase":"animal migration understanding","score":0.4021487832},{"key-phrase":"historical exploration route","score":0.37903741},{"key-phrase":"spatial cognition","score":0.3561779261},{"key-phrase":"standard corpus training","score":0.3555368781},{"key-phrase":"movement","score":0.3523772955},{"key-phrase":"standard corpus","score":0.3227338195},{"key-phrase":"route direction","score":0.3176577687},{"key-phrase":"implicit movement","score":0.3142415583},{"key-phrase":"Global Positioning Systems","score":0.3087624907},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3053819537},{"key-phrase":"hand labeling","score":0.2965923846},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2889437079},{"key-phrase":"precise geographic coordinate","score":0.2760389745},{"key-phrase":"comparable corpora","score":0.2710626125},{"key-phrase":"crowd voting","score":0.2361335158},{"key-phrase":"traditional machine learning","score":0.2316439152},{"key-phrase":"time stamp","score":0.2221726328},{"key-phrase":"computational processing","score":0.1942138821},{"key-phrase":"prediction accuracy","score":0.179676339},{"key-phrase":"model ensembling","score":0.1733832657},{"key-phrase":"high human labeling cost","score":0.1448472142},{"key-phrase":"iterative process","score":0.1139824614},{"key-phrase":"other phenomena","score":0.1132798344},{"key-phrase":"computational technique","score":0.1025512367},{"key-phrase":"large silver","score":0.0474356189},{"key-phrase":"small gold","score":0.043255277},{"key-phrase":"acceptable level","score":-0.0107558155}]},{"Cluster":13,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":282,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Land cover classification based on machine learning using UAV multi-spectral images","Abstract":"Land cover classification using UAV multi-spectral images is of great significance in precision agriculture, urban planning, land use and other fields. However, traditional remote sensing image classification methods cannot meet the classification accuracy requirements of UAV multi-spectral images. This paper aims to propose an object-based machine learning classification method to improve the land over classification accuracy of UAV multi-spectral images. The experimental area is a standard test field located in the Jilin Province of China. The experimental data was captured by a UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera which includes four bands from 550 nm to 790 nm. First, the original images were preprocessed and the spectral curves of land cover were analyzed, thus four kinds of land cover with large differences were selected as categories. Then pixel-based, boosting-based and object-based machine learning methods were used for classification. The object-based classification method could make full use of the spatial and spectral information, and eliminate the noise problem caused by the high resolution of the UAV image to a certain extent. Finally, accuracy analysis using the verification image showed that the RF-O method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 92.2419%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.8904. All results indicate that the object-based machine learning classification method proposed in this paper is more suitable for the research of land cover classification, comparing with the traditional remote sensing image classification methods, and performs well on the land cover classification of UAV multi-spectral images. \u00a9 2020 SPIE.","Author Keywords":"Image classification; Machine learning; UAV remote sensing","Authors":"Pan L., Gu L., Ren R., Yang S.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2566128","x":9.84,"y":-4.71,"KeyPhrases":["Land cover classification","UAV image","spectral curve","image classification method","precision agriculture"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Land cover classification","score":0.6523941159},{"key-phrase":"image classification method","score":0.483073324},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.4700167179},{"key-phrase":"UAV image","score":0.4637451172},{"key-phrase":"machine learning classification","score":0.4229750335},{"key-phrase":"classification method","score":0.3821796179},{"key-phrase":"multi-spectral image","score":0.3628382683},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.3582373857},{"key-phrase":"UAV","score":0.3564923406},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.3328062892},{"key-phrase":"precision agriculture","score":0.3326911926},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.3250029087},{"key-phrase":"spatial and spectral information","score":0.3215256333},{"key-phrase":"classification","score":0.3083688021},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy requirement","score":0.2970711887},{"key-phrase":"multi-spectral camera","score":0.2896036208},{"key-phrase":"accuracy analysis","score":0.2249922454},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2164417505},{"key-phrase":"verification image","score":0.1964534074},{"key-phrase":"spectral curve","score":0.1863970608},{"key-phrase":"high resolution","score":0.1377870142},{"key-phrase":"kappa coefficient","score":0.1081656739},{"key-phrase":"Jilin Province","score":0.0798570961},{"key-phrase":"other field","score":0.0721531212},{"key-phrase":"noise problem","score":0.060489092},{"key-phrase":"experimental area","score":0.0562164374},{"key-phrase":"large difference","score":0.0561780483},{"key-phrase":"great significance","score":0.0558495931},{"key-phrase":"full use","score":0.0543688014},{"key-phrase":"standard test field","score":0.0468948781},{"key-phrase":"original image","score":0.0378770754},{"key-phrase":"experimental data","score":0.0315451995},{"key-phrase":"O method","score":0.0138053792},{"key-phrase":"certain extent","score":-0.0199752003}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":283,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Remote sensing and GIS approach for environmental green areas planning using Landsat satellite imagery, Dubai-UAE","Abstract":"Over the last decade, Dubai emirate witnessed a vast, rapidly growing population, that doubled since 2008.

Considering the spectral and spatial signatures for green areas machine learning techniques will be adopted to select the most significant features to classify and extract green areas. Second, using environmental relational indices, green areas percentages will be quantitatively compared to Sentinel air quality data, such as NO2 and SO2, as well as the population density maps. Finally, GIS techniques will be used to create Dubai Environmental Critical Map (DECM), to locate districts with limited green areas and high pollution to improve environmental standards.

In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages\/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover\/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Big data; cloud computing; Google Earth Engine (GEE); remote sensing (RS)","Authors":"Amani M., Ghorbanian A., Ahmadi S.A., Kakooei M., Moghimi A., Mirmazloumi S.M., Moghaddam S.H.A., Mahdavi S., Ghahremanloo M., Parsian S., Wu Q., Brisco B.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2020.3021052","x":9.85,"y":-4.52,"KeyPhrases":["Google Earth Engine","climate analysis","Sentinel datasets","big data processing","Land Cover"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Google Earth Engine","score":0.5775222182},{"key-phrase":"big geo data","score":0.4816761911},{"key-phrase":"Sentinel datasets","score":0.4693347812},{"key-phrase":"GEE publication","score":0.4200943708},{"key-phrase":"GEE platform","score":0.4085713327},{"key-phrase":"big data analysis","score":0.3880672455},{"key-phrase":"GEE user","score":0.3674683571},{"key-phrase":"climate analysis","score":0.3639232814},{"key-phrase":"Land Cover","score":0.3624204397},{"key-phrase":"big data processing","score":0.3578647673},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.3498280048},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.3434556127},{"key-phrase":"image classification task","score":0.3211245537},{"key-phrase":"image processing","score":0.2732766867},{"key-phrase":"large area","score":0.2590378523},{"key-phrase":"RS application","score":0.2391392291},{"key-phrase":"various application","score":0.2273001969},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2153284252},{"key-phrase":"GEE","score":0.1876668632},{"key-phrase":"different application","score":0.1602833569},{"key-phrase":"journal article","score":0.1427284777},{"key-phrase":"desktop computing resource","score":0.1391292065},{"key-phrase":"massive volume","score":0.1283257008},{"key-phrase":"different field","score":0.1253726333},{"key-phrase":"common software package","score":0.1200204715},{"key-phrase":"broad range","score":0.1071503013},{"key-phrase":"natural disaster","score":0.0851225853},{"key-phrase":"journal","score":0.0776730627},{"key-phrase":"high potential","score":0.0702158809},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0231802799},{"key-phrase":"long period","score":0.0226211455},{"key-phrase":"past few year","score":0.022568278},{"key-phrase":"different aspect","score":-0.0090241693}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":286,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Predicting the environment of a neighborhood: A use case for France","Abstract":"Notion of neighbourhoods is critical in many applications such as social studies, cultural heritage management, urban planning or environment impact on health.

This process usually costs much time in the early design stage when the condition of a city has not been finally determined. Thus the designers spend a lot of time working forward and backward drawing sketches for different characteristics of cities. Meanwhile, machine learning, as a decision-making tool, has been widely used in many fields. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a model frame in machine learning, specially designed to learn and generate image data. Therefore, this research aims to apply GAN in creating urban design plans, helping designers automatically generate the predicted details of buildings configuration with a given condition of cities. Through the machine learning of image pairs, the result shows the relationship between the site conditions (roads, green lands, and rivers) and the configuration of buildings. This automatic design tool can help release the heavy load of urban designers in the early design stage, quickly providing a preview of design solutions for urban design tasks. The analysis of different machine learning models trained by the data from different cities inspires urban designers with design strategies and features in distinct conditions. \u00a9 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Urban design","Authors":"Shen J., Liu C., Ren Y., Zheng H.","DOI":null,"x":7.84,"y":-4.54,"KeyPhrases":["urban design plan","Generative Adversarial Network","automatic design tool","different machine learning","site condition"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban design plan","score":0.5596666932},{"key-phrase":"urban design task","score":0.5312081575},{"key-phrase":"Generative Adversarial Network","score":0.5099015236},{"key-phrase":"GAN","score":0.4746617079},{"key-phrase":"urban scale plan","score":0.4569541812},{"key-phrase":"automatic design tool","score":0.4070032537},{"key-phrase":"urban designer","score":0.346370697},{"key-phrase":"design strategy","score":0.3078588247},{"key-phrase":"designer","score":0.301766634},{"key-phrase":"early design stage","score":0.2961834669},{"key-phrase":"design solution","score":0.2852218151},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2576502264},{"key-phrase":"different machine learning","score":0.2549437284},{"key-phrase":"image data","score":0.249172762},{"key-phrase":"image pair","score":0.2013941109},{"key-phrase":"site condition","score":0.1881050169},{"key-phrase":"different city","score":0.1522099674},{"key-phrase":"many field","score":0.1293860674},{"key-phrase":"model frame","score":0.1178674251},{"key-phrase":"green land","score":0.0946242064},{"key-phrase":"heavy load","score":0.0639862642},{"key-phrase":"much time","score":0.0158686209},{"key-phrase":"distinct condition","score":0.0092849107}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":288,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A Machine Learning-Based Method for Predicting Urban Land Use","Abstract":"Land use is one of the most basic elements of urban management. In urban planning and design, land use is often determined by experience and case studies. However, the development of urbanization has led to a combinatory trend for land use, and the land use of a plot is always impacted by the surrounding environment. In such a complex situation, it is difficult to find hidden relationships among types of land use by humans alone. Within artificial intelligence, machine learning can help find correlations among data. This paper presents a new method for learning the rules relating the known land use data and predicting the land use of a target plot by constructing an artificial neural network. We take Nanjing as a specific case and study the logic of its land use. The results not only demonstrate associations between the surroundings and the target but also show the feasibility of a combinatory land use index in urban planning and design. \u00a9 2020 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural network; Land use; Machine learning; Urban planning and design","Authors":"Xia X., Tong Z.","DOI":null,"x":8.54,"y":-3.08,"KeyPhrases":["combinatory land use","artificial neural network","hidden relationship","urban management","target plot"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"combinatory land use","score":0.5599315166},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5397518873},{"key-phrase":"known land use","score":0.5204087496},{"key-phrase":"Land use","score":0.5014986992},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.4596599042},{"key-phrase":"urban management","score":0.4198603928},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3985375166},{"key-phrase":"land","score":0.3575249314},{"key-phrase":"artificial intelligence","score":0.3500299454},{"key-phrase":"complex situation","score":0.2097736597},{"key-phrase":"combinatory trend","score":0.2033989578},{"key-phrase":"hidden relationship","score":0.1906075478},{"key-phrase":"target plot","score":0.1662998199},{"key-phrase":"combinatory","score":0.1639952064},{"key-phrase":"specific case","score":0.1430225372},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1343375593},{"key-phrase":"new method","score":0.1238375008},{"key-phrase":"basic element","score":0.0221136827}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":289,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Road Centerline Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images","Abstract":"Road extraction from the high-resolution remote sensing image is significant for the land planning, vehicle navigation, etc. The existing road extraction methods normally need many preprocessing and subsequent optimization steps. Therefore, an automatic road centerline extraction method based on the self-supervised learning framework for high-resolution remote sensing image is proposed. This proposed method does not need to manually select training samples and other optimization steps, such as the nonroad area removing. First, the positive sample selection method combining the spectral and shape features is proposed to extract the road sample. Then, the one-class classifier framework is introduced and the random forest positive unlabeled learning classifier is constructed to get the posterior probability of the pixel belonging to road. The shape feature and the posterior probability are combined to form the final road network in the object-oriented way. Finally, the road centerline is obtained through the tensor voting algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, high-resolution remote sensing images and benchmark datasets are used to do experiments. The indexes of the completeness ratio, the correctness ratio, and the detection quality are used for the quantitative accuracy evaluation. Compared with the supervised, the unsupervised, and the one-class classification road extraction algorithms, this proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy and efficiency. For the deep learning method comparison, the deep learning method performs well in most cases especially in the complex urban area. However, the deep learning method needs a large number of samples and a long training time, and our self-supervised learning framework does not need the training samples. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"High-resolution remote sensing image; one-class classifier; road centerline; road extraction; self-supervised learning","Authors":"Guo Q., Wang Z.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2020.3014242","x":9.4,"y":-5.24,"KeyPhrases":["road extraction method","positive unlabeled learning classifier","deep learning method","complex urban area","tensor voting algorithm"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"road extraction method","score":0.5661396384},{"key-phrase":"Road extraction","score":0.4917986691},{"key-phrase":"class classification road","score":0.4514861107},{"key-phrase":"automatic road centerline","score":0.3959295154},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.3812797368},{"key-phrase":"deep learning method","score":0.3697006702},{"key-phrase":"road centerline","score":0.3477911353},{"key-phrase":"positive unlabeled learning classifier","score":0.3394463062},{"key-phrase":"final road network","score":0.3250716925},{"key-phrase":"supervised learning framework","score":0.3211607933},{"key-phrase":"road","score":0.3166863024},{"key-phrase":"road sample","score":0.3095752001},{"key-phrase":"nonroad area","score":0.3054146469},{"key-phrase":"training sample","score":0.3006218076},{"key-phrase":"complex urban area","score":0.2934512496},{"key-phrase":"extraction algorithms","score":0.2901824117},{"key-phrase":"shape feature","score":0.275606662},{"key-phrase":"class classifier framework","score":0.2696360052},{"key-phrase":"detection quality","score":0.2604079843},{"key-phrase":"tensor voting algorithm","score":0.2405569255},{"key-phrase":"high accuracy","score":0.2322574705},{"key-phrase":"vehicle navigation","score":0.2284656167},{"key-phrase":"land planning","score":0.1879330128},{"key-phrase":"extraction method","score":0.1813160181},{"key-phrase":"positive sample selection","score":0.17558451},{"key-phrase":"quantitative accuracy evaluation","score":0.1451728791},{"key-phrase":"benchmark datasets","score":0.1241904497},{"key-phrase":"other optimization step","score":0.0829533339},{"key-phrase":"large number","score":0.0720994025},{"key-phrase":"sample","score":0.0720428675},{"key-phrase":"long training time","score":0.0686079413},{"key-phrase":"completeness ratio","score":0.0608112141},{"key-phrase":"preprocessing and subsequent optimization step","score":0.0589256883},{"key-phrase":"correctness ratio","score":0.0542872772},{"key-phrase":"posterior probability","score":0.0504245013}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":290,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Uncertainties of human perception in visual image interpretation in complex urban environments","Abstract":"Today satellite images are mostly exploited automatically due to advances in image classification methods. Manual visual image interpretation (MVII), however, still plays a significant role e.g., to generate training data for machine-learning algorithms or for validation purposes. In certain urban environments, however, of e.g., highest densities and structural complexity, textural and spectral complications in overlapping roof-structures still demand the human interpreter if one aims to capture individual building structures. The cognitive perception and real-world experience are still inevitable. Against these backgrounds, this article aims at quantifying and interpreting the uncertainties of mapping rooftop footprints of such areas. We focus on the agreement among interpreters and which aspects of perception and elements of image interpretation affect mapping. Ten test persons digitized six complex built-up areas. Hereby, we receive quantitative information about spatial variables of buildings to systematically check the consistency and congruence of results. An additional questionnaire reveals qualitative information about obstacles. Generally, we find large differences among interpreters' mapping results and a high consistency of results for the same interpreter. We measure rising deviations correlate with a rising morphologic complexity. High degrees of individuality are expressed e.g., in time consumption, in-situ- or geographic information system (GIS)-precognition whereas data source mostly influences the mapping procedure. By this study, we aim to fill a gap as prior research using MVII often does not implement an uncertainty analysis or quantify mapping aberrations. We conclude that remote sensing studies should not only rely unquestioned on MVII for validation; furthermore, data and methods are needed to suspend uncertainty. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Cognition; earth observation; elements of image interpretation; level of individual buildings (LoD-1); manual visual image interpretation (MVII); perception; uncertainty; urban morphology","Authors":"Kraff N.J., Wurm M., Taubenbock H.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2020.3011543","x":6.4699997902,"y":6.1999998093,"KeyPhrases":["mapping rooftop footprint","cognitive perception","image interpretation","geographic information system","uncertainty analysis"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"mapping rooftop footprint","score":0.5815346241},{"key-phrase":"Manual visual image interpretation","score":0.4914519191},{"key-phrase":"geographic information system","score":0.4241905808},{"key-phrase":"image interpretation","score":0.4116034508},{"key-phrase":"individual building structure","score":0.3725239336},{"key-phrase":"cognitive perception","score":0.3613436222},{"key-phrase":"image classification method","score":0.3546486199},{"key-phrase":"uncertainty analysis","score":0.3369530439},{"key-phrase":"Today satellite image","score":0.3333053589},{"key-phrase":"mapping procedure","score":0.330108583},{"key-phrase":"mapping aberration","score":0.3149237633},{"key-phrase":"certain urban environment","score":0.3109349608},{"key-phrase":"structural complexity","score":0.3046885133},{"key-phrase":"quantitative information","score":0.2956602573},{"key-phrase":"spatial variable","score":0.2952688336},{"key-phrase":"textural and spectral complication","score":0.2611350417},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.2548093796},{"key-phrase":"qualitative information","score":0.2538129389},{"key-phrase":"such area","score":0.2479199767},{"key-phrase":"human interpreter","score":0.2424410433},{"key-phrase":"morphologic complexity","score":0.2410629392},{"key-phrase":"interpreter","score":0.2068314999},{"key-phrase":"same interpreter","score":0.1772253662},{"key-phrase":"large difference","score":0.1477511227},{"key-phrase":"validation purpose","score":0.1310802251},{"key-phrase":"additional questionnaire","score":0.1263369024},{"key-phrase":"real-world experience","score":0.1204559207},{"key-phrase":"deviation correlate","score":0.1151325703},{"key-phrase":"time consumption","score":0.1021368802},{"key-phrase":"test person","score":0.1017419845},{"key-phrase":"prior research","score":0.0724025145},{"key-phrase":"high consistency","score":0.0654590949},{"key-phrase":"data source","score":0.0623782501},{"key-phrase":"significant role","score":0.0578966513},{"key-phrase":"MVII","score":0.0548710898},{"key-phrase":"High degree","score":0.0404129401}]},{"Cluster":4,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":291,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"5th EAI International Smart City 360 Summit, 2019","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 38 papers.

However, accurate assessment and prediction of air quality in urban areas are difficult. In major cities, typically only a limited number of air quality monitoring stations are available, and inferring air quality in the un-sampled areas throughout the city is challenging. On the other hand, air quality varies in the urban areas non-linearly; it is highly spatially dependent and considerably influenced by multiple factors, such as building distribution, traffic situation and land uses. In this research, we model air quality in the city of Augsburg using spatial features and high quality sensor data. We identify spatial features such as types and areas of different land uses, road networks with high resolution. We integrate open available data to the air quality prediction. In this regard, we compare a simple baseline model with linear regression models (Ordinary Least-Squares and Ridge Regression) and tree-based machine-learning models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest). In our evaluation, given the non-linearity of the data, tree-based models outperform all linear models, which are commonly used in literatures. In addition, we created an interactive and visual dashboard. This dashboard demonstrates the analytical workflow, gives insight into model performance and uncertainty and visualizes the results. \u00a9 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.","Author Keywords":"Air quality; Dashboard; Land-use regression; Machine-learning","Authors":"Shen Y., Lehmler S., Murshed S.M., Riedel T.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-51005-3_12","x":-5.0300002098,"y":7.9899997711,"KeyPhrases":["air quality prediction","urban planning","Random Forest","interactive and visual dashboard","high quality sensor"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"air quality prediction","score":0.7256759405},{"key-phrase":"air quality monitoring","score":0.555785656},{"key-phrase":"Air quality","score":0.5267497897},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.4869256616},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3886884153},{"key-phrase":"Gradient Boosting","score":0.3745134175},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3705823421},{"key-phrase":"learning model","score":0.3388434052},{"key-phrase":"Ridge Regression","score":0.3173990846},{"key-phrase":"spatial feature","score":0.3153915703},{"key-phrase":"urban life","score":0.312815249},{"key-phrase":"linear model","score":0.2902943492},{"key-phrase":"air","score":0.2700417936},{"key-phrase":"linear regression model","score":0.261990875},{"key-phrase":"model performance","score":0.2475379407},{"key-phrase":"accurate assessment","score":0.2295960784},{"key-phrase":"traffic situation","score":0.2181700766},{"key-phrase":"high quality sensor","score":0.2143837214},{"key-phrase":"major city","score":0.212398231},{"key-phrase":"simple baseline model","score":0.2120242864},{"key-phrase":"road network","score":0.2040503025},{"key-phrase":"analytical workflow","score":0.1786352992},{"key-phrase":"un-sampled area","score":0.1620524973},{"key-phrase":"quality","score":0.139912501},{"key-phrase":"important topic","score":0.1350948215},{"key-phrase":"open available data","score":0.1253949851},{"key-phrase":"interactive and visual dashboard","score":0.1207795739},{"key-phrase":"human health","score":0.0997054502},{"key-phrase":"different land","score":0.074736774},{"key-phrase":"high resolution","score":0.0471070297},{"key-phrase":"multiple factor","score":0.0467874184},{"key-phrase":"great significance","score":0.0261534918},{"key-phrase":"limited number","score":-0.023715267},{"key-phrase":"other hand","score":-0.0395307615}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":293,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Sensing Mixed Urban Land-Use Patterns Using Municipal Water Consumption Time Series","Abstract":"The biased population coverage and short temporal lengths of newly emerged data sets (e.g., data sets of social media, mobile phones, and smart cards) obstruct the effective analysis of long-term dynamics of landuse patterns, particularly in small and developing cities. This study proposed a framework to delineate and analyze mixed land-use patterns and their evolution using municipal water consumption data. A two-step classification strategy was designed based on the rotation forest scheme to differentiate the socioeconomic types of customers (e.g., residence, commerce, public facility, manufacturing, and recreation) using multiple features extracted from the various forms of water consumption time series. The spatial distributions of the socioeconomic functions were then derived, and the mixed land use was measured using a diversity index based on information entropy. Such an approach was applied to Changshu, a typical developing county-level city in China, for the period 2004 to 2013. The results showed that the urbanization of Changshu experienced both spatial expansion and intensification, with a slightly declining rate of growth in recent years. Apart from the city center, two subcenters have emerged for industrial development. The degree of land-use mixture has increased with urban growth, indicating a maturing of urbanization. This study explored the approach of identifying individual socioeconomic functions by the consumption patterns of municipal services and demonstrated that municipal service data sets can reveal land-use patterns and dynamics at a fine spatial resolution to evaluate urban planning and management, with the advantages of large population coverage and long-term temporal lengths. \u00a9 2020, \u00a9 2020 by American Association of Geographers.","Author Keywords":"land-use patterns; mixed land use; municipal water consumption; rotation forest; social sensing","Authors":"Guan Q., Cheng S., Pan Y., Yao Y., Zeng W.","DOI":"10.1080\/24694452.2020.1769463","x":8.62,"y":-3.42,"KeyPhrases":["urban growth","rotation forest scheme","information entropy","municipal water consumption","mixed land use"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban growth","score":0.5046046972},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5002177358},{"key-phrase":"mixed land use","score":0.4697861075},{"key-phrase":"mixed land","score":0.3935928345},{"key-phrase":"municipal water consumption","score":0.3743025661},{"key-phrase":"municipal service data","score":0.3335682452},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic type","score":0.3070864677},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.2982800603},{"key-phrase":"large population coverage","score":0.2741060257},{"key-phrase":"information entropy","score":0.2702656686},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic function","score":0.2673542202},{"key-phrase":"diversity index","score":0.2645863295},{"key-phrase":"rotation forest scheme","score":0.2512931228},{"key-phrase":"individual socioeconomic function","score":0.2489037812},{"key-phrase":"landuse pattern","score":0.2476773262},{"key-phrase":"municipal service","score":0.2308352292},{"key-phrase":"municipal","score":0.2214007974},{"key-phrase":"industrial development","score":0.2053234428},{"key-phrase":"biased population coverage","score":0.20285137},{"key-phrase":"consumption pattern","score":0.2027433515},{"key-phrase":"level city","score":0.2026461661},{"key-phrase":"step classification strategy","score":0.1973488629},{"key-phrase":"data set","score":0.1907406002},{"key-phrase":"spatial expansion","score":0.188408196},{"key-phrase":"effective analysis","score":0.1851280928},{"key-phrase":"water consumption time","score":0.1823217571},{"key-phrase":"changshu","score":0.1821280867},{"key-phrase":"use mixture","score":0.1753524393},{"key-phrase":"city center","score":0.164393425},{"key-phrase":"multiple feature","score":0.1607663631},{"key-phrase":"long-term dynamic","score":0.1411459446},{"key-phrase":"use pattern","score":0.1264238358},{"key-phrase":"long-term temporal length","score":0.1056018993},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0960571915},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone","score":0.0944423899},{"key-phrase":"various form","score":0.0931289196},{"key-phrase":"fine spatial resolution","score":0.0901007354},{"key-phrase":"smart card","score":0.0807608068},{"key-phrase":"social medium","score":0.0295325108},{"key-phrase":"short temporal length","score":0.0163279884},{"key-phrase":"public facility","score":0.0000704238}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":294,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Mining and Analysis of Air Quality Data to Aid Climate Change","Abstract":"The data science and AI community has gathered around the world to support tackling the climate change problem in different domains.

The comprehensive proposed approach is the combination of following four steps. In the first phase, a dictionary of traffic-related keywords is formed. Secondly, real-time Twitter data has been collected using the dictionary of identified traffic related keywords. In the third step, collected tweets have been pre-processed, and the feature generation model is applied to convert the dataset eligible for a machine learning classifier. Further, a machine learning model is trained and tested to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents.

The second phase is data handling operation using MapReduce framework. Third phase deals with decision-making which is an important step to classify the events and produce the decisions accurately.

However, in big cities taxi service is still unbalanced, resulting in inefficiencies such as long waiting times and excessive vacant trips. This paper presents an exploratory taxi fleet service analysis and compares two forecast models aimed at predicting the spatiotemporal variation of short-term taxi demand. For this paper, we used a large sample with more than 1 million trips between 2014 and 2017, representing roughly 10% of Lisbon's fleet. We analysed the spatiotemporal variation between pick-up and drop-off locations and how they are affected by weather conditions and points of interest. More, based on historic data, we built two models to predict the demand, ARIMA and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and evaluated and compared the performance of both models. This study not only allows the direct comparison of a linear statistical model with a machine learning one, but also leads to a better comprehension of complex interactions surrounding different urban data sources using the taxi service as a probe to better understand urban mobility-on-demand and its needs. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

The framework models the population distribution as a spatiotemporal regression problem using machine learning, and it obtains the binary urban footprint from the population distribution through a binary classifier plus a temporal correction for existing urban regions. The framework estimates the urban footprint in color from its previous value, as well as from past and current values of the binary urban footprint using a semantic inpainting algorithm. By combining this framework with free data from the Landsat archive and the Global Human Settlement Layer framework, interested users can get approximate growth predictions of any city in the world. These predictions can be improved with the inclusion in the framework of additional spatially distributed input variables over time subject to availability. Unlike widely used growth models based on cellular automata, there are two main advantages of using the proposed machine learning-based framework. Firstly, it does not require to define rules a priori because the model learns the dynamics of growth directly from the historical data. Secondly, it is very easy to train new machine learning models using different explanatory input variables to assess their impact. As a proof of concept, we tested the framework in Valledupar and Rionegro, two Latin American cities located in Colombia with different geomorphological characteristics, and found that the model predictions were in close agreement with the ground-truth based on performance metrics, such as the root-mean-square error, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient for continuous variables, and a few others for discrete variables such as the intersection over union, accuracy, and the f1 metric. In summary, our framework for modeling urban growth is flexible, allows sensitivity analyses, and can help policymakers worldwide to assess different what-if scenarios during the planning cycle of sustainable and resilient cities. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Computer vision; Machine learning; Spatiotemporal modeling; Urban growth; Urban planning tools; Urban science","Authors":"G\u00f3mez J.A., Pati\u00f1o J.E., Duque J.C., Passos S.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs12010109","x":9.0,"y":-3.44,"KeyPhrases":["urban growth","semantic inpainting algorithm","model prediction","Landsat archive","cellular automata"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban growth","score":0.6087316275},{"key-phrase":"urban footprint","score":0.5604431629},{"key-phrase":"binary urban footprint","score":0.5436748862},{"key-phrase":"approximate growth prediction","score":0.431288898},{"key-phrase":"urban region","score":0.4257118106},{"key-phrase":"sustainable and resilient city","score":0.4056801796},{"key-phrase":"Human Settlement Layer","score":0.4024757147},{"key-phrase":"growth model","score":0.3721418381},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal regression problem","score":0.3470401168},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.334672451},{"key-phrase":"model prediction","score":0.3226963282},{"key-phrase":"semantic inpainting algorithm","score":0.3181996942},{"key-phrase":"new machine learning","score":0.2956225574},{"key-phrase":"Latin American city","score":0.265039444},{"key-phrase":"population distribution","score":0.2570070028},{"key-phrase":"cellular automata","score":0.2536787689},{"key-phrase":"binary classifier","score":0.2449926138},{"key-phrase":"footprint","score":0.2255332619},{"key-phrase":"Landsat archive","score":0.2253076136},{"key-phrase":"continuous variable","score":0.2065738142},{"key-phrase":"historical data","score":0.1886662841},{"key-phrase":"planning cycle","score":0.188222602},{"key-phrase":"different explanatory input variable","score":0.1718754321},{"key-phrase":"temporal correction","score":0.170860365},{"key-phrase":"framework model","score":0.160905391},{"key-phrase":"sensitivity analysis","score":0.1376296282},{"key-phrase":"binary","score":0.1247901171},{"key-phrase":"general framework","score":0.1224487573},{"key-phrase":"free data","score":0.1197251529},{"key-phrase":"important variable","score":0.1115212888},{"key-phrase":"input variable","score":0.0978946388},{"key-phrase":"square error","score":0.0964944065},{"key-phrase":"past and current value","score":0.0767369121},{"key-phrase":"previous value","score":0.0692565739},{"key-phrase":"time subject","score":0.0480634384},{"key-phrase":"Pearson's correlation coefficient","score":0.0397434235},{"key-phrase":"interested user","score":0.0370619893},{"key-phrase":"close agreement","score":0.0155456886},{"key-phrase":"few others","score":-0.0088769626},{"key-phrase":"main advantage","score":-0.0249292739}]},{"Cluster":4,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":300,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Secure blockchain-based traffic load balancing using edge computing and reinforcement learning","Abstract":"Congestion represents one of the major problems in constantly growing cities, and the expansion and modernization of the traffic system are a major priority to all government infrastructures. In effect, more efficient traffic represents a more efficient economy. Solving the issue of congestion by increasing the number of roads is not always the most cost-effective solution as it represents massive changes in city infrastructures that have been present for decades. Urban planning shapes the environment around us but fails to address specifically the future traffic clogging. Our research tackles the problem of traffic congestion by proposing a system for vehicle detection, identification, and count, allied with reinforcement learning for traffic congestion anticipation and prediction. The need for a real-time and efficient system led us to push the research and development onto an Edge Computing platform using IoT and secure transactions using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. Blockchain intervenes as a security protocol in the proposed system. The native form of Internet of Things does not include security protocols which are important to a large scale implementation. Ensuring the security of transactions and permanent access control is the main reason why blockchain is rooted in our system architecture. Our project aims to reduce the traffic load on roads experiencing significant congestion, and improve overall city traffic system without costly investment into new communication infrastructures and city planning. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Author Keywords":"Blockchain; Containerization; Edge computing; Hyperledger fabric; Machine learning; Traffic congestion","Authors":"Tiba K., Parizi R.M., Zhang Q., Dehghantanha A., Karimipour H., Choo K.-K.R.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-38181-3_6","x":5.9,"y":-1.79,"KeyPhrases":["traffic system","Hyperledger Fabric blockchain","Edge Computing platform","secure transaction","Urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"traffic system","score":0.5333982706},{"key-phrase":"future traffic clogging","score":0.4842230976},{"key-phrase":"traffic congestion anticipation","score":0.4616096318},{"key-phrase":"blockchain","score":0.4333352149},{"key-phrase":"traffic congestion","score":0.4266108871},{"key-phrase":"Edge Computing platform","score":0.4058759809},{"key-phrase":"overall city traffic","score":0.3933259845},{"key-phrase":"efficient traffic","score":0.3879739046},{"key-phrase":"Hyperledger Fabric blockchain","score":0.3793469667},{"key-phrase":"vehicle detection","score":0.376134038},{"key-phrase":"traffic load","score":0.3590769768},{"key-phrase":"city infrastructure","score":0.3265082836},{"key-phrase":"real-time and efficient system","score":0.3128959239},{"key-phrase":"large scale implementation","score":0.2905631363},{"key-phrase":"Urban planning","score":0.2805814445},{"key-phrase":"congestion","score":0.2790188789},{"key-phrase":"new communication infrastructure","score":0.2726491392},{"key-phrase":"city planning","score":0.268648088},{"key-phrase":"government infrastructure","score":0.2526285052},{"key-phrase":"security protocol","score":0.2515191138},{"key-phrase":"significant congestion","score":0.2404971719},{"key-phrase":"system architecture","score":0.2348479331},{"key-phrase":"secure transaction","score":0.2295463681},{"key-phrase":"efficient economy","score":0.2011620104},{"key-phrase":"permanent access control","score":0.171425581},{"key-phrase":"costly investment","score":0.1713153124},{"key-phrase":"major priority","score":0.1010413542},{"key-phrase":"effective solution","score":0.0775917321},{"key-phrase":"major problem","score":0.0532794148},{"key-phrase":"main reason","score":0.0520171225},{"key-phrase":"massive change","score":0.0357557908},{"key-phrase":"native form","score":0.0100746863}]},{"Cluster":14,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":301,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Application of satellite image segmentation for urban planning optimization","Abstract":"This article presents research results of a convolution neural network for building detection on high-resolution aerial images of Planet database.

This article proposes a machine learning, hierarchical object-based method to map slum settlements using very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and land boundary data to support slum upgrading. The proposed method is tested in Kingston Metropolitan Area, Jamaica. First, the VHR imagery is classified into major land cover classes (i.e., the initial land cover map). Second, the VHR imagery and land boundary layer are used to obtain homogenous neighborhoods (HNs). Third, the initial land cover map is used to derive multiple context, spectral, and texture image features according to the local physical characteristics of slum settlements. Fourth, a machine-learning classifier, classification and regression trees, is used to classify HNs into slum and nonslum settlements using only the effective image features. Finally, reference data collected manually are used to assess the accuracy of the classification. In the training site, an overall accuracy of 0.935 is achieved. The effective image indicators for slum mapping include the building layout, building density, building roof characteristics, and distance from buildings to gullies. The classifier and those features selected from the training site are further used to map slums in two validating sites to assess the transferability of our approach. Overall accuracy of the two validating sites reached 0.928 and 0.929, respectively, suggesting that the features and classification model obtained from one site has the potential to be transferred to other areas in Jamaica and possibly other developing Caribbean countries with similar situation and data availability. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Classification and regression trees (CART); Jamaica; object-oriented classification; slum settlements; very high-resolution (VHR) image","Authors":"Williams T.K.-A., Wei T., Zhu X.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2019.2954407","x":9.25,"y":-4.41,"KeyPhrases":["slum mapping","classification model","effective image feature","major land cover","VHR"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"slum mapping","score":0.6841155291},{"key-phrase":"slum upgrading","score":0.5092407465},{"key-phrase":"slum settlement","score":0.4861001968},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4474538565},{"key-phrase":"slum","score":0.4401395917},{"key-phrase":"major land cover","score":0.4065765738},{"key-phrase":"land boundary data","score":0.40135023},{"key-phrase":"Accurate mapping","score":0.3736151457},{"key-phrase":"classification model","score":0.3582567275},{"key-phrase":"land boundary layer","score":0.3447257876},{"key-phrase":"initial land cover","score":0.3314290047},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3221010566},{"key-phrase":"effective image feature","score":0.318885535},{"key-phrase":"homogenous neighborhood","score":0.2819182277},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical object","score":0.2804261148},{"key-phrase":"VHR imagery","score":0.2757323384},{"key-phrase":"texture image","score":0.2560992837},{"key-phrase":"nonslum settlement","score":0.2551133037},{"key-phrase":"Kingston Metropolitan Area","score":0.2547308207},{"key-phrase":"regression tree","score":0.25426355},{"key-phrase":"building layout","score":0.243441537},{"key-phrase":"Caribbean country","score":0.204058975},{"key-phrase":"effective image indicator","score":0.1983082294},{"key-phrase":"other area","score":0.1917299926},{"key-phrase":"reference data","score":0.1754210889},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1402257085},{"key-phrase":"VHR","score":0.1148004159},{"key-phrase":"training site","score":0.1095653027},{"key-phrase":"local physical characteristic","score":0.1075516641},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0980987251},{"key-phrase":"multiple context","score":0.0636309162},{"key-phrase":"data availability","score":0.0537450165},{"key-phrase":"similar situation","score":0.0342620537}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":303,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Comparison of performance of artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) in the classification of land cover zones of urban slum region","Abstract":"India is one of the world\u2019s largest economies and economic growth has remained continuous. This has led to accelerating urbanization which requires proper planning and monitoring. As the urban areas are expanding, urban slum areas are also increasing along with it. These growing urban slum areas require proper observation so that existing resources can be employed to provide these regions with the best possible livelihood conditions. For this purpose, urban slum areas as well as surrounding land resources should be well identified and classified so that the existing land resources can be appropriately utilized for future implementation of development activities. Machine learning classification algorithms are found to be very suitable for the identification and classification of remotely sensed images. Their efficiency in feature identification and extraction has established these algorithms as important tools in decision making. In this study, our major objective is to identify and classify different land cover zones in the urban slums areas of Chingrajpara area of Chhattisgarh using remotely-sensed images. For this purpose, high-resolution images, collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are used and these images are classified into different land cover features using two different machine learning algorithms Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF). The results obtained show that the overall accuracy achieved by ANN and RF are 72.6% and 84.35% respectively.

The comparison was conducted with multiple tests clustered in three types of scenarios.

The second scenario tests the algorithms on randomly selected roads over eight consecutive 15 min intervals; the third scenario tests the algorithms on random roads for the duration of a whole day.

However, obtaining accurate information about urban built-up areas is a challenge. This study developed a general-purpose built-up area intelligent classification (BAIC) system that supports various types of data and classifiers. All of the steps in the BAIC were implemented using Python modules including Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. We used the BAIC to conduct a classification experiment that involved seven types of input data; namely, Point of Interest (POI), Road Network (RN), nighttime light (NTL), a combination of POI and RN data (POI_RN), a combination of POI and NTL data (POI_NTL), a combination of RN and NTL data (RN_NTL), and a combination of POI, RN, and NTL data (POI_RN_NTL), and five classifiers, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and AdaBoost. The results show the following: (1) among the 35 combinations of the five classifiers and seven types of input data, the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 76 to 89%, F1 values ranged from 0.73 to 0.86, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. The largest F1 value and OA were obtained using the POI_RN_NTL data and AdaBoost, while the largest AUC was obtained using POI_RN_NTL and POI_NTL data against AdaBoost, LR, and RF; and (2) the advantages of the BAIC include its support for multi-source input data, its objective accuracy assessment, and its robust classifiers. The BAIC can quickly and efficiently realize the automatic classification of urban built-up areas at a reasonably low cost and can be readily applied to other urban areas in the world where any kind of POI, RN, or NTL data coverage is available. The results of this study are expected to provide timely and effective reference information for urban planning and urban management departments, and could also potentially be used to develop large-scale maps of urban built-up areas in the future. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; NTL; POI; Road network; Urban built-up area","Authors":"Sun L., Tang L., Shao G., Qiu Q., Lan T., Shao J.","DOI":"10.3390\/RS12010091","x":6.3499999046,"y":5.8299999237,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","Random Forests","NTL data coverage","nighttime light","F1 value"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4770153165},{"key-phrase":"Random Forests","score":0.4750673175},{"key-phrase":"intelligent classification","score":0.4580449462},{"key-phrase":"Decision Trees","score":0.4470420778},{"key-phrase":"other urban area","score":0.4354982972},{"key-phrase":"automatic classification","score":0.418633163},{"key-phrase":"Decision Tree","score":0.4104768932},{"key-phrase":"urban management department","score":0.3279906511},{"key-phrase":"Logistic Regression","score":0.3173868656},{"key-phrase":"objective accuracy assessment","score":0.284845829},{"key-phrase":"robust classifier","score":0.2829153538},{"key-phrase":"classification experiment","score":0.2764341831},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.2536729872},{"key-phrase":"large-scale map","score":0.2497947514},{"key-phrase":"Road Network","score":0.2367732227},{"key-phrase":"accurate information","score":0.2150172591},{"key-phrase":"BAIC","score":0.202976495},{"key-phrase":"nighttime light","score":0.186466217},{"key-phrase":"input data","score":0.1761867106},{"key-phrase":"NTL data coverage","score":0.175647229},{"key-phrase":"POI_RN_NTL data","score":0.169439882},{"key-phrase":"RN data","score":0.156807512},{"key-phrase":"POI_NTL data","score":0.1337523162},{"key-phrase":"multi-source input data","score":0.1297330856},{"key-phrase":"NTL data","score":0.1029972285},{"key-phrase":"low cost","score":0.0990482271},{"key-phrase":"various type","score":0.0891132206},{"key-phrase":"F1 value","score":0.0718028545},{"key-phrase":"timely and effective reference information","score":0.0584982745},{"key-phrase":"Python module","score":0.0556983761},{"key-phrase":"RN","score":0.005751173}]},{"Cluster":27,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":306,"Cited by":null,"Year":2020,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"2nd Ibero-American Congress of Smart Cities, ICSC-CITIES 2019","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 22 papers.

However, constructing a reasonable and robust forecasting model is a challenging task due to the uncertainties and nonlinear characteristics of traffic flow. Aiming at the nonlinear relationship affecting traffic flow forecasting effect, a PSO-ELM model based on particle swarm optimization is proposed for short-term traffic flow forecasting, which takes the advantages of particle swarm optimization to search global optimal solution and extreme learning machine to fast deal with the nonlinear relationship. The proposed model improves the accuracy of traffic flow forecasting. The traffic flow data from highways A1, A2, A4, A8 connecting to Amsterdam's ring road are employed for the case study. The RMSEs of PSO-ELM model are respectively 252.61, 173.75, 200.24, 146.05, while the MAPEs of PSO-ELM model are respectively 11.86%, 10.10%, 10.74%, 11.60%.

While most previous studies focused on two-dimensional urban development, the spatial characteristics of building heights are rarely explored. Such information could provide valuable implications for smart urban planning and management. However, previous attempts did not systematically investigate the spatial factors that influence building heights and their associations with urban development. Therefore, this study developed a machine learning-based method to compare the distributions of building heights in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two cities with different development patterns. First, we collected detailed information on the buildings, such as the location and land values. Second, the height of each building was simulated based on the above information using the well-known random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and artificial neural network. The random forests algorithm outperformed the other two in both cities. We also found that the commercial land value is the most important factor associated with building heights. Moreover, the building heights in Guangzhou are more sensitive to the distances to administrative centers, while the distances to transportation networks exert stronger influences on the building heights in Shenzhen. Overall, these findings could support urban planning and management. More importantly, the proposed method can be used to predict the heights of new buildings and investigate the distributions of building heights in other regions. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Building heights; Machine learning; Spatial factors; Urban modeling","Authors":"Lin J., Wan H., Cui Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scs.2019.101854","x":8.15,"y":-3.27,"KeyPhrases":["dimensional urban development","random forest","building height","smart urban planning","valuable implication"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"dimensional urban development","score":0.5353041887},{"key-phrase":"smart urban planning","score":0.5271780491},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5028687716},{"key-phrase":"urban development","score":0.483774066},{"key-phrase":"building height","score":0.4712602496},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4648418427},{"key-phrase":"random forests algorithm","score":0.4619495273},{"key-phrase":"Rapid urbanization","score":0.4176945388},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3492570519},{"key-phrase":"spatial characteristic","score":0.340829581},{"key-phrase":"new building","score":0.3369813561},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.3360853493},{"key-phrase":"land value","score":0.3329406381},{"key-phrase":"commercial land value","score":0.3260090351},{"key-phrase":"building","score":0.2995240688},{"key-phrase":"neighbor algorithm","score":0.2819682062},{"key-phrase":"height","score":0.2256617546},{"key-phrase":"spatial factor","score":0.191279918},{"key-phrase":"transportation network","score":0.1845150292},{"key-phrase":"different development pattern","score":0.1531902701},{"key-phrase":"other region","score":0.0881509632},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0860945135},{"key-phrase":"important factor","score":0.0845485181},{"key-phrase":"Such information","score":0.0758121908},{"key-phrase":"above information","score":0.0700533167},{"key-phrase":"administrative center","score":0.0634916425},{"key-phrase":"previous study","score":0.051270213},{"key-phrase":"detailed information","score":0.0432999432},{"key-phrase":"valuable implication","score":0.0205629375},{"key-phrase":"previous attempt","score":0.002814237},{"key-phrase":"serious issue","score":-0.08087264}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":311,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Automatic identification of the social functions of areas of interest (AOIS) using the standard hour-day-spectrum approach","Abstract":"The social function of areas of interest (AOIs) is crucial to the identification of urban functional zoning and land use classification, which has been a hot topic in various fields such as urban planning and smart city fields. Most existing studies on urban functional zoning and land use classification either largely rely on low-frequency remote sensing images, which are constrained to the block level due to their spatial scale limitation, or suffer from low accuracy and high uncertainty when using dynamic data, such as social media and traffic data. This paper proposes an hour-day-spectrum (HDS) approach for generating six types of distribution waveforms of taxi pick-up and drop-off points which serve as interpretation indicators of the social functions of AOIs. To achieve this goal, we first performed fine-grained cleaning of the drop-off points to eliminate the spatial errors caused by taxi drivers. Next, buffer and spatial clustering were integrated to explore the associations between travel behavior and AOIs. Third, the identification of AOI types was made by using the standard HDS method combined with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Finally, some matching tests were carried out by similarity indexes of a standard HDS and sample HDS, i.e., the Gaussian kernel function and Pearson coefficient, to ensure matching accuracy. The experiment was conducted in the Chongchuan and Gangzha Districts, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, China. By training 50 AOI samples, six types of standard HDS of residential districts, schools, hospitals, and shopping malls were obtained. Then, 108 AOI samples were tested, and the overall accuracy was found to be 90.74%. This approach generates value-added services of the taxi trajectory and provides a continuous update and fine-grained supplementary method for the identification of land use types. In addition, the approach is object-oriented and based on AOIs, and can be combined with image interpretation and other methods to improve the identification effect. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"AOI; Land use type; Machine learning; Social function; Urban functional zoning","Authors":"Zhou T., Liu X., Qian Z., Chen H., Tao F.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi9010007","x":5.55,"y":-3.29,"KeyPhrases":["land use classification","taxi trajectory","smart city field","Gaussian kernel function","urban functional zoning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land use classification","score":0.5323620439},{"key-phrase":"urban functional zoning","score":0.5028270483},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4457177222},{"key-phrase":"spatial clustering","score":0.4371020198},{"key-phrase":"smart city field","score":0.4184964001},{"key-phrase":"land use type","score":0.4019793272},{"key-phrase":"traffic data","score":0.3747366667},{"key-phrase":"taxi trajectory","score":0.3736432791},{"key-phrase":"residential district","score":0.3350581825},{"key-phrase":"similarity index","score":0.293342948},{"key-phrase":"Gangzha Districts","score":0.2617313266},{"key-phrase":"taxi driver","score":0.2541669011},{"key-phrase":"travel behavior","score":0.2418915331},{"key-phrase":"distribution waveform","score":0.2246637791},{"key-phrase":"spatial scale limitation","score":0.2001673281},{"key-phrase":"identification effect","score":0.1973316669},{"key-phrase":"dynamic data","score":0.1807742268},{"key-phrase":"image interpretation","score":0.1718379557},{"key-phrase":"Gaussian kernel function","score":0.1712654233},{"key-phrase":"various field","score":0.1674871147},{"key-phrase":"social medium","score":0.1619508713},{"key-phrase":"social function","score":0.1540071815},{"key-phrase":"Jiangsu Province","score":0.1422736943},{"key-phrase":"spatial error","score":0.140150547},{"key-phrase":"standard HDS method","score":0.13822487},{"key-phrase":"shopping mall","score":0.1332436502},{"key-phrase":"HDS","score":0.1174788475},{"key-phrase":"off point","score":0.1153824627},{"key-phrase":"low accuracy","score":0.1068420485},{"key-phrase":"AOI sample","score":0.1051462591},{"key-phrase":"sample HDS","score":0.1030056626},{"key-phrase":"matching test","score":0.1029249504},{"key-phrase":"interpretation indicator","score":0.0961175933},{"key-phrase":"AOI type","score":0.0950515643},{"key-phrase":"high uncertainty","score":0.0899503008},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.0858843774},{"key-phrase":"Pearson coefficient","score":0.0770243406},{"key-phrase":"aois","score":0.066904299},{"key-phrase":"standard HDS","score":0.0478275269},{"key-phrase":"other method","score":0.0396924764},{"key-phrase":"hot topic","score":0.0391740613},{"key-phrase":"existing study","score":0.0186419487},{"key-phrase":"block level","score":0.0147036705},{"key-phrase":"continuous update","score":-0.0124751404},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained supplementary method","score":-0.0335414931},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained cleaning","score":-0.0437681824}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":312,"Cited by":11.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Mapping Urban Trees Within Cadastral Parcels Using an Object-Based Convolutional Neural Network","Abstract":"Urban trees offer significant benefits for improving the sustainability and liveability of cities, but its monitoring is a major challenge for urban planners. Remote-sensing based technologies can effectively detect, monitor and quantify urban tree coverage as an alternative to field-based measurements. Automatic extraction of urban land cover features with high accuracy is a challenging task and it demands artificial intelligence workflows for efficiency and thematic quality. In this context, the objective of this research is to map urban tree coverage per cadastral parcel of Sandy Bay, Hobart from very high-resolution aerial orthophoto and LiDAR data using an Object Based Convolution Neural Network (CNN) approach. Instead of manual preparation of a large number of required training samples, automatically classified Object based image analysis (OBIA) output is used as an input samples to train CNN method. Also, CNN output is further refined and segmented using OBIA to assess the accuracy. The result shows 93.2% overall accuracy for refined CNN classification. Similarly, the overlay of improved CNN output with cadastral parcel layer shows that 21.5% of the study area is covered by trees. This research demonstrates that the accuracy of image classification can be improved by using a combination of OBIA and CNN methods. Such a combined method can be used where manual preparation of training samples for CNN is not preferred. Also, our results indicate that the technique can be implemented to calculate parcel level statistics for urban tree coverage that provides meaningful metrics to guide urban planning and land management practices. \u00a9 2019 Authors.","Author Keywords":"Cadastral Parcel; Convolutional Neural Network; GEOBIA; Machine Learning; Urban Trees","Authors":"Timilsina S., Sharma S.K., Aryal J.","DOI":"10.5194\/isprs-annals-IV-5-W2-111-2019","x":9.54,"y":-5.09,"KeyPhrases":["urban land cover","refined CNN classification","LiDAR data","cadastral parcel","Urban tree"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land cover","score":0.6099337339},{"key-phrase":"urban tree coverage","score":0.5858616233},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4456240535},{"key-phrase":"Urban tree","score":0.387332499},{"key-phrase":"refined CNN classification","score":0.3854283392},{"key-phrase":"image classification","score":0.3732304573},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3554476798},{"key-phrase":"LiDAR data","score":0.3520043492},{"key-phrase":"CNN method","score":0.3494924605},{"key-phrase":"land management practice","score":0.3120212257},{"key-phrase":"image analysis","score":0.311005801},{"key-phrase":"CNN output","score":0.2868713737},{"key-phrase":"classified Object","score":0.284686327},{"key-phrase":"Neural Network","score":0.2450870126},{"key-phrase":"cadastral parcel layer","score":0.2420452237},{"key-phrase":"cadastral parcel","score":0.217877388},{"key-phrase":"CNN","score":0.2168566585},{"key-phrase":"Automatic extraction","score":0.2064395845},{"key-phrase":"training sample","score":0.2046390772},{"key-phrase":"high accuracy","score":0.2028826475},{"key-phrase":"parcel level statistic","score":0.1917127669},{"key-phrase":"artificial intelligence workflow","score":0.1901502013},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1796495467},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1756612957},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution aerial orthophoto","score":0.1675884873},{"key-phrase":"required training sample","score":0.1371143162},{"key-phrase":"Sandy Bay","score":0.1156420112},{"key-phrase":"input sample","score":0.1133595407},{"key-phrase":"OBIA","score":0.1035568416},{"key-phrase":"challenging task","score":0.1034743264},{"key-phrase":"large number","score":0.0991524383},{"key-phrase":"thematic quality","score":0.0920503885},{"key-phrase":"combined method","score":0.078756772},{"key-phrase":"manual preparation","score":0.0770967603},{"key-phrase":"major challenge","score":0.0652929693},{"key-phrase":"significant benefit","score":0.0639664829}]},{"Cluster":9,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":313,"Cited by":40.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A human-machine adversarial scoring framework for urban perception assessment using street-view images","Abstract":"Though global-coverage urban perception datasets have been recently created using machine learning, their efficacy in accurately assessing local urban perceptions for other countries and regions remains a problem.

This is due to the complexity of the urban environment and its unpredictability. Many researches have been carried out in the past decades until recent time, to find a way to solve this problem using powerful sensors such as laser rangefinder sensor, RGB-D camera, stereo vision system, LIDAR and computer vision methods. This paper is aimed to present an urban intelligent navigator for drone using CNN (convolutional neural network). The application of computer vision (object detection) is cheap and has low power consumption compared to other kinds of vision systems. The machine learning allows a drone to detect and recognize all the objects and obstacles on the roads, which can block drone's way. One thousand images were captured of six different street objects (tree, lamp, bump sign, free-smoking sign, no-horn sign, and roof-wall). Those images were used as a dataset to create a machine learning using Faster R-CNN (region convolutional neural network) method. Three machine-learning models were created using different parameters for each model. The controlled parameters are the initial learning rate and the batch-size. Only the third model could successfully detect and recognize all the objects at a specified location showing 98% accuracy. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Convolution neural networks; Faster R-CNN; Object detection; object recognition","Authors":"Moteir I.G.M.I., Ismail K., Zawawi F.M., Azhar M.M.M.","DOI":"10.1109\/SmartNets48225.2019.9069781","x":9.33,"y":-5.79,"KeyPhrases":["urban intelligent navigator","convolutional neural network","drone","different street object","powerful sensor"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban intelligent navigator","score":0.5394234657},{"key-phrase":"drone","score":0.4601072967},{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.4408831894},{"key-phrase":"computer vision","score":0.3740444481},{"key-phrase":"object detection","score":0.359466821},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3507272601},{"key-phrase":"computer vision method","score":0.3357426524},{"key-phrase":"stereo vision system","score":0.3177916408},{"key-phrase":"vision system","score":0.3172607422},{"key-phrase":"different street object","score":0.2899852991},{"key-phrase":"powerful sensor","score":0.2852531374},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2768747211},{"key-phrase":"learning model","score":0.2483582646},{"key-phrase":"laser rangefinder sensor","score":0.2300238907},{"key-phrase":"initial learning rate","score":0.1906000972},{"key-phrase":"D camera","score":0.1641158909},{"key-phrase":"low altitude","score":0.1555869728},{"key-phrase":"low power consumption","score":0.1414127499},{"key-phrase":"Many research","score":0.10658402},{"key-phrase":"difficult and challenging task","score":0.0987384617},{"key-phrase":"different parameter","score":0.0711284801},{"key-phrase":"bump sign","score":0.0697277635},{"key-phrase":"free-smoking sign","score":0.0667527989},{"key-phrase":"third model","score":0.0664587766},{"key-phrase":"sign","score":0.0640892833},{"key-phrase":"horn sign","score":0.0577435642},{"key-phrase":"recent time","score":0.0213959552},{"key-phrase":"other kind","score":-0.0039105923},{"key-phrase":"past decade","score":-0.0082003791}]},{"Cluster":20,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":315,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Urban street contexts classification using convolutional neural networks and streets imagery","Abstract":"The classification of streets on road networks has been focused on the vehicular transportational features of streets. Examples of street labels include arterials, major roads, minor roads and so forth based on their transportational use. City authorities on the other hand have been shifting to more wholistic planning of streets. The modern approach towards designing and planning streets is more inclusive of the street context, meaning the side use of a street combined with the transportational features of a street. Several city authorities are developing new classification schemes for street context that extends traditional classification methods to include the use of land on the sides of a street. In those classification schemes, streets are labeled for example as commercial throughway, residential neighborhood, park etc. This modern approach to urban planning have been adopted by major cities such as the city of San Francisco, the state of Florida and Pennsylvania among many others. Currently, the process of labeling streets according to their contexts is manual and hence is tedious and time consuming. It will require manual labor to regularly relabel streets as the city develops. In this paper, we propose an approach to deploy advancements in computer vision towards modern urban planning. We propose a framework for automatic classification of street contexts. Using labeled street imagery we train deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform the classification of street context. We show that CNN models can perform well achieving accuracies in the 81% to 87% range. We test various CNN architectures and report on their performances. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Applications; Big Data; Computer Vision; Data from the wild; IoT; Urban Computing","Authors":"Alhasoun F., Gonzalez M.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2019.00198","x":5.7300000191,"y":6.5599999428,"KeyPhrases":["convolutional neural network","modern urban planning","street context","new classification scheme","vehicular transportational feature"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.453137815},{"key-phrase":"street imagery","score":0.4488147795},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4141273499},{"key-phrase":"street context","score":0.4034685493},{"key-phrase":"road network","score":0.3959149718},{"key-phrase":"CNN model","score":0.3915454745},{"key-phrase":"street","score":0.3851400316},{"key-phrase":"modern urban planning","score":0.3833138943},{"key-phrase":"various CNN architecture","score":0.3383164406},{"key-phrase":"automatic classification","score":0.3256613016},{"key-phrase":"major road","score":0.3249822855},{"key-phrase":"residential neighborhood","score":0.3058657646},{"key-phrase":"computer vision","score":0.3039259911},{"key-phrase":"vehicular transportational feature","score":0.2860664725},{"key-phrase":"City authority","score":0.2847647071},{"key-phrase":"Several city authority","score":0.2583576441},{"key-phrase":"classification scheme","score":0.2578331828},{"key-phrase":"minor road","score":0.2411763668},{"key-phrase":"street label","score":0.2386672497},{"key-phrase":"new classification scheme","score":0.2253797948},{"key-phrase":"traditional classification method","score":0.2201722562},{"key-phrase":"major city","score":0.2172028124},{"key-phrase":"transportational feature","score":0.2087530792},{"key-phrase":"transportational use","score":0.1858644485},{"key-phrase":"wholistic planning","score":0.1668939739},{"key-phrase":"transportational","score":0.1577304751},{"key-phrase":"San Francisco","score":0.1559182405},{"key-phrase":"commercial throughway","score":0.1445762664},{"key-phrase":"side use","score":0.126720801},{"key-phrase":"manual labor","score":0.0976851806},{"key-phrase":"modern approach","score":0.086562112},{"key-phrase":"many others","score":0.0296697002},{"key-phrase":"other hand","score":0.0196269229}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":316,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Integrating activity-based geographic information and long-term remote sensing to characterize urban land use change","Abstract":"The land use structure is a key component to understand the complexity of urban systems because it provides a snapshot of urban dynamics and how people use space. This paper integrates socially sensed activity data with a remotely sensed land cover product in order to infer urban land use and its changes over time. We conducted a case study in theWashington D.C.-Baltimore metropolitan area to identify the pattern of land use change from undeveloped to developed land, including residential and non-residential uses for a period covering 1986-2008. The proposed approach modeled physical and behavioral features of land parcels from a satellite-based impervious surface cover change product and georeferenced Tweets, respectively. A model assessment with random forests classifiers showed that the proposed classification workflow could classify residential and non-residential land uses at an accuracy of 81%, 4% better than modeling the same land uses from physical features alone. Using the timestamps of the impervious surface cover change product, the study also reconstructed the timeline of the identified land uses. The results indicated that the proposed approach was capable of mapping detailed land use and change in an urban region, and represents a new and viable way forward for urban land use surveying that could be especially useful for surveying and tracking changes in cities where traditional approaches and mapping products (i.e., from remote sensing products) may have a limited capacity to capture change. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Activity patterns; Land use; Machine learning; Social sensing; Twitter","Authors":"Fu C., Song X.-P., Stewart K.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11242965","x":9.17,"y":-3.88,"KeyPhrases":["urban land use","classification workflow","activity data","mapping product","impervious surface cover"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land use","score":0.6139825583},{"key-phrase":"land use change","score":0.5575202703},{"key-phrase":"detailed land use","score":0.5562696457},{"key-phrase":"land use structure","score":0.4869798422},{"key-phrase":"residential and non-residential land","score":0.457875818},{"key-phrase":"developed land","score":0.4360473156},{"key-phrase":"urban system","score":0.4249251783},{"key-phrase":"urban region","score":0.3887116015},{"key-phrase":"random forest classifier","score":0.3817362189},{"key-phrase":"land cover product","score":0.3763798773},{"key-phrase":"land","score":0.366871357},{"key-phrase":"land parcel","score":0.3523937166},{"key-phrase":"classification workflow","score":0.3152627349},{"key-phrase":"activity data","score":0.280570358},{"key-phrase":"same land","score":0.2626458406},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan area","score":0.2105218172},{"key-phrase":"mapping product","score":0.1715726852},{"key-phrase":"impervious surface cover","score":0.1541760564},{"key-phrase":"physical feature","score":0.1478626132},{"key-phrase":"model assessment","score":0.14718844},{"key-phrase":"physical and behavioral feature","score":0.1423995495},{"key-phrase":"new and viable way","score":0.0795714185},{"key-phrase":"change product","score":0.0699524432},{"key-phrase":"traditional approach","score":0.0651370734},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.0633908659},{"key-phrase":"key component","score":0.0457410701},{"key-phrase":"limited capacity","score":0.0350831188},{"key-phrase":"product","score":0.0317020491}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":317,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and cropland in the Nile Delta of Egypt using machine learning and satellite big data: implications for sustainable development","Abstract":"The Nile Delta of Egypt is increasingly facing sustainability threats, due to a combination of nature- and human-induced changes in land cover and land use. In this paper, an analysis of big time series data from remotely sensed satellite images and the random forests classifier was undertaken to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of urbanization and cropland in the Nile Delta between 2007 and 2017. Out of thirteen variables, five spectral indices were chosen to build 500 decision trees, with a resulting overall accuracy average of 91.9 \u00b1 1.5%. The results revealed that the urban extent in the Nile Delta has increased, between 2007 and 2017, by 592.4 km2 (1.92%). Particularly, the results indicated that the years 2011 and 2012, which coincided the 2011 political uprising in Egypt, so-called the Arab Spring, were associated with significant land-use changes in the Nile Delta, both in rate and scale. As a result, the cropland area in the region decreased between 2010 and 2011 by 1.63% (502.21 km2). Moreover, the results showed that during the period 2012\u20132017, the mean annual urbanization rate in the region stood at 60 km2\/year. In contrast, croplands decreased during the same period at an average annual rate of 2 km2\/year. At the governorates\u2019 level, the results suggested that top agricultural producing governorates in the Nile Delta, such as Elmonoufia, Elkalubia, Elbouhyra, and Elghrbia, witnessed the highest rates of decrease in cropland areas during the period 2012\u20132017. Over the same period, urban areas increased the most in Elkalubia, Domiate, and Elmonoufia by 1.98%, 1.72%, and 1.34%, respectively. The f indings from this analysis are discussed along with their implications for sustainable land-use and urban planning policies. \u00a9 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Author Keywords":"Big data; LULC; Nile Delta; Random forests; Sustainable development; Urbanization","Authors":"Badreldin N., Abu Hatab A., Lagerkvist C.-J.","DOI":"10.1007\/s10661-019-7934-x","x":9.63,"y":-3.89,"KeyPhrases":["sustainable land","random forest classifier","Nile Delta","mean annual urbanization rate","big time series"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"sustainable land","score":0.4265941381},{"key-phrase":"random forest classifier","score":0.4186522961},{"key-phrase":"cropland area","score":0.4160339832},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.415846169},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.4148563147},{"key-phrase":"Nile Delta","score":0.398811996},{"key-phrase":"significant land","score":0.3680764735},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3551616073},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3484985232},{"key-phrase":"urban extent","score":0.328704685},{"key-phrase":"mean annual urbanization rate","score":0.3275819719},{"key-phrase":"sustainability threat","score":0.3243613243},{"key-phrase":"satellite image","score":0.3037865162},{"key-phrase":"nile","score":0.3003202677},{"key-phrase":"Arab Spring","score":0.2867383063},{"key-phrase":"urban planning policy","score":0.2594356239},{"key-phrase":"delta","score":0.212820366},{"key-phrase":"human-induced change","score":0.2086228132},{"key-phrase":"spatial and temporal dynamic","score":0.1861010045},{"key-phrase":"big time series","score":0.1680885851},{"key-phrase":"political uprising","score":0.1614991128},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy average","score":0.15364407},{"key-phrase":"average annual rate","score":0.1505885571},{"key-phrase":"use change","score":0.1339112818},{"key-phrase":"spectral index","score":0.1219363809},{"key-phrase":"same period","score":0.016739184},{"key-phrase":"f indings","score":-0.0313138589}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":318,"Cited by":16.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Deprivation pockets through the lens of convolutional neural networks","Abstract":"Machine learning techniques have been frequently applied to map urban deprivation (commonly referred to as slums) in very high-resolution satellite images. Among these, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown exceptional efficiency in automated deprivation mapping at the local scale. Yet these networks have never been used to map very small heterogeneous deprivation areas (pockets) at large scale. This study proposes and evaluates a U-Net-Compound model to map deprivation pockets in Bangalore, India. The model only relies on RGB satellite images with a resolution of 2 m as these are more commonly accessible to local urban planning departments. The experiment assumes a practical situation where only limited reference data is available for the model to learn the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets. It tests whether an updated map of deprivation pockets can be obtained with limited information. The model performance to map a large number of deprivation pockets is examined by incrementally changing the model architecture and the amount of training data. Results show that the proposed model is sensitive to the amount of spatial information contained in the training data. Once sufficient spatial information is learnt through a few samples, the city scale mapping accuracy outperforms existing models in mapping small deprivation pockets, achieving a Jaccard Index of 54%. This study demonstrated that a well-designed convolutional neural network can map the existence, extent, as well as distribution patterns of deprivation pockets at the city scale with limited training data, which is essential for upscaling research outputs to provide important information for the formulation of pro-poor policies. \u00a9 2019","Author Keywords":"Bangalore; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deprivation pockets; Slums","Authors":"Wang J., Kuffer M., Roy D., Pfeffer K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.rse.2019.111448","x":6.2600002289,"y":6.3499999046,"KeyPhrases":["deprivation mapping","convolutional neural network","local urban planning department","RGB satellite image","limited training data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"deprivation mapping","score":0.5629017353},{"key-phrase":"urban deprivation","score":0.4708644748},{"key-phrase":"city scale mapping","score":0.4272400439},{"key-phrase":"small heterogeneous deprivation area","score":0.3973110914},{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.3904920816},{"key-phrase":"Convolutional Neural Networks","score":0.3690464497},{"key-phrase":"local urban planning department","score":0.3647856712},{"key-phrase":"RGB satellite image","score":0.3384780586},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.3343471289},{"key-phrase":"spatial information","score":0.3263314962},{"key-phrase":"city scale","score":0.3149180412},{"key-phrase":"sufficient spatial information","score":0.3071990013},{"key-phrase":"limited training data","score":0.2947060764},{"key-phrase":"deprivation pocket","score":0.2919542491},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution satellite","score":0.2672973871},{"key-phrase":"deprivation","score":0.2653460503},{"key-phrase":"small deprivation pocket","score":0.264475435},{"key-phrase":"Machine learning technique","score":0.2478860021},{"key-phrase":"U-Net-Compound model","score":0.245434925},{"key-phrase":"pro-poor policy","score":0.2439193875},{"key-phrase":"large scale","score":0.2199286968},{"key-phrase":"limited reference data","score":0.197295785},{"key-phrase":"local scale","score":0.1830201149},{"key-phrase":"distribution pattern","score":0.1773774326},{"key-phrase":"spatial morphology","score":0.1734412909},{"key-phrase":"model architecture","score":0.1475082934},{"key-phrase":"few sample","score":0.1335566938},{"key-phrase":"limited information","score":0.1249642447},{"key-phrase":"research output","score":0.1128100604},{"key-phrase":"model performance","score":0.110312663},{"key-phrase":"large number","score":0.1066189706},{"key-phrase":"pocket","score":0.0823442042},{"key-phrase":"important information","score":0.0757981241},{"key-phrase":"practical situation","score":0.0754818469},{"key-phrase":"Jaccard Index","score":0.0237260833},{"key-phrase":"Result show","score":-0.0008901637},{"key-phrase":"exceptional efficiency","score":-0.0324731693}]},{"Cluster":3,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":319,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"ADMSv2: A modern architecture for transportation data management and analysis","Abstract":"This paper presents ADMSv2, an end-to-end data-driven system that enables real-time and historical data analytics and machine learning tasks over big, streaming, spatiotemporal data.

However, natural ventilation requirements and guidelines in current building codes and standards are either qualitative or quantitative but subject to an absolute indoor airspeed threshold without considering the outdoor wind environment. To fill this gap, this paper develops an urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and defines a novel ventilation index to assess natural ventilation potential. The index considers wind environments of both indoor and outdoor spaces. First, the coupled CFD model is developed to study wind-driven cross ventilation in high-density cities. A 3D isothermal CFD simulation is solved using the RNG k-\u03b5 turbulent model. The simulation results are compared with wind tunnel experiment data from literature. Second, six key design variables are used to generate 3840 parametric design variations for natural ventilation assessment. Third, a novel integrated index CIOIv (coupled indoor and outdoor interaction) is proposed to evaluate the wind speed ratio between the indoor area and outdoor reference area. For demonstration, CIOIv,F1 is used to represent CIOIv on the ground level. Data-driven CIOIv,F1 models are developed to predict indoor building ventilation potential for quick early design support. Compared with multivariate linear regression model, the Gradient Boosting non-linear model displays much higher prediction accuracy (mean absolute percentage error = 0.16 with R2 = 0.8). In early design stage, designers and engineers can skip the computational expensive CFD simulations and use this data-drive model to quickly check the building natural ventilation potentials of different design options in an urban environment. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Coupled CFD simulation; Data-driven model; Early design support; High-density city; Machine learning; Urban ventilation","Authors":"Ding C., Lam K.P.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2019.106394","x":5.5300002098,"y":2.5,"KeyPhrases":["Effective urban ventilation","outdoor computational fluid dynamic","wind speed ratio","key design variable","current building code"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Effective urban ventilation","score":0.6810476184},{"key-phrase":"indoor building ventilation","score":0.5952371359},{"key-phrase":"natural ventilation assessment","score":0.5607008934},{"key-phrase":"natural ventilation potential","score":0.5491242409},{"key-phrase":"novel ventilation index","score":0.5407037735},{"key-phrase":"natural ventilation requirement","score":0.4834473729},{"key-phrase":"outdoor wind environment","score":0.4764042199},{"key-phrase":"wind environment","score":0.4434443414},{"key-phrase":"outdoor computational fluid dynamic","score":0.4187765718},{"key-phrase":"cross ventilation","score":0.4175168276},{"key-phrase":"ventilation","score":0.4165216088},{"key-phrase":"computational expensive CFD simulation","score":0.4120325148},{"key-phrase":"wind speed ratio","score":0.3670192361},{"key-phrase":"CFD model","score":0.3646454811},{"key-phrase":"absolute indoor airspeed threshold","score":0.3641763926},{"key-phrase":"building design","score":0.360260725},{"key-phrase":"3D isothermal CFD simulation","score":0.3463521004},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3380438685},{"key-phrase":"current building code","score":0.3379635215},{"key-phrase":"wind tunnel experiment","score":0.332754463},{"key-phrase":"turbulent model","score":0.322163403},{"key-phrase":"indoor and outdoor space","score":0.3027502596},{"key-phrase":"indoor and outdoor interaction","score":0.2817688286},{"key-phrase":"high-density city","score":0.2666398287},{"key-phrase":"parametric design variation","score":0.2107644826},{"key-phrase":"indoor area","score":0.2104654014},{"key-phrase":"indoor","score":0.2036287487},{"key-phrase":"decent urban planning","score":0.1959533989},{"key-phrase":"non-linear model","score":0.1907713711},{"key-phrase":"key design variable","score":0.1842810363},{"key-phrase":"early design stage","score":0.1694342792},{"key-phrase":"outdoor reference area","score":0.1684730649},{"key-phrase":"prediction accuracy","score":0.1489854604},{"key-phrase":"F1 model","score":0.1369800121},{"key-phrase":"multivariate linear regression model","score":0.1232827902},{"key-phrase":"simulation result","score":0.1167388484},{"key-phrase":"different design option","score":0.1152836531},{"key-phrase":"quick early design support","score":0.1072492152},{"key-phrase":"index CIOIv","score":0.1008847952},{"key-phrase":"absolute percentage error","score":0.0770637915},{"key-phrase":"drive model","score":0.0561934821},{"key-phrase":"ground level","score":0.0301958919},{"key-phrase":"RNG k","score":0.0057710614}]},{"Cluster":19,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":323,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"An urban data framework for assessing equity in cities: Comparing accessibility to healthcare facilities in Cascadia","Abstract":"As cities continue to grow worldwide, policymakers and urban planners face the dual task of meeting rising demand for essential services while ensuring that benefits accrue to their citizens equitably. We propose a framework for assessing inclusivity and equity in cities, which leverages open data and machine learning techniques to inform urban infrastructure investment strategies. The framework is applied at a regional scale to compare differential access to healthcare facilities (public hospitals and clinics) via public transit in Vancouver, Seattle and Portland. We find important distributional impacts on vulnerable populations across the three cities. Portland displays the highest inequity in hospital and clinic access, and Vancouver the least, owing to Vancouver's relatively compact geographic area and high population density. For seniors, over 75% are socially excluded from hospitals and over 50% from clinics in Portland, compared to 30% and 3% respectively in Vancouver. In all three cities, significantly more residents of low-income neighborhoods are excluded from healthcare compared to their counterparts in high-income neighborhoods. This translates into proportionally higher transportation costs for low-income area residents compared with high-income area residents, regardless of whether they are socially excluded or not. Transportation costs are notably high for low-income seniors in Seattle and Vancouver. These findings pose a challenge for inclusive planning, since low-income and senior populations may require specialized services and are more reliant on public transportation than the average population. Our evaluation framework provides a systematic approach for municipalities to account for the distributional effects of transportation and service infrastructure planning, to integrate equity into their decision-making, and to learn from the successes and pitfalls of each other's urban policies. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Equality; Gini index; Inclusivity; Machine learning; Self-organizing maps","Authors":"Mayaud J.R., Tran M., Nuttall R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101401","x":6.5599999428,"y":4.25,"KeyPhrases":["urban policy","low-income and senior population","machine learning technique","transportation cost","open data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban policy","score":0.546946764},{"key-phrase":"low-income and senior population","score":0.5274561644},{"key-phrase":"urban infrastructure investment","score":0.5139318705},{"key-phrase":"high-income neighborhood","score":0.4720092714},{"key-phrase":"inclusive planning","score":0.4662293196},{"key-phrase":"low-income neighborhood","score":0.4437766969},{"key-phrase":"high-income area","score":0.4365949035},{"key-phrase":"public transit","score":0.4133540988},{"key-phrase":"low-income area","score":0.4091175795},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.4067432284},{"key-phrase":"public transportation","score":0.4040769935},{"key-phrase":"clinic access","score":0.3521427214},{"key-phrase":"vulnerable population","score":0.3474020958},{"key-phrase":"open data","score":0.3097155094},{"key-phrase":"transportation cost","score":0.3076856732},{"key-phrase":"high population density","score":0.3045191467},{"key-phrase":"vancouver","score":0.2888583839},{"key-phrase":"service infrastructure planning","score":0.2780343294},{"key-phrase":"regional scale","score":0.2479543537},{"key-phrase":"healthcare facility","score":0.2459555566},{"key-phrase":"important distributional impact","score":0.2300590724},{"key-phrase":"average population","score":0.2178488672},{"key-phrase":"public hospital","score":0.2172770798},{"key-phrase":"income","score":0.2056201845},{"key-phrase":"evaluation framework","score":0.1970644146},{"key-phrase":"essential service","score":0.1932474524},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.1758445799},{"key-phrase":"compact geographic area","score":0.1740407646},{"key-phrase":"distributional effect","score":0.1703965962},{"key-phrase":"systematic approach","score":0.169318974},{"key-phrase":"differential access","score":0.1596826166},{"key-phrase":"specialized service","score":0.1451583058},{"key-phrase":"dual task","score":0.0673977584}]},{"Cluster":6,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":324,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Topic modeling to discover the thematic structure and spatial-temporal patterns of building renovation and adaptive reuse in cities","Abstract":"Building alteration and redevelopment play a central role in the revitalization of developed cities, where the scarcity of available land limits the construction of new buildings. The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Big data; Building alteration; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Topic modeling","Authors":"Lai Y., Kontokosta C.E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101383","x":6.07,"y":-3.36,"KeyPhrases":["urban redevelopment","latent Dirichlet allocation","popular word","building permit data","natural language processing"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban redevelopment","score":0.5495765209},{"key-phrase":"latent Dirichlet allocation","score":0.5317070484},{"key-phrase":"text mining","score":0.4906552136},{"key-phrase":"topic modeling","score":0.4789620042},{"key-phrase":"unstructured text data","score":0.4719035327},{"key-phrase":"urban change","score":0.4684042931},{"key-phrase":"other urban data","score":0.447018981},{"key-phrase":"topic modeling output","score":0.4418396652},{"key-phrase":"building alteration activity","score":0.4278340936},{"key-phrase":"natural language processing","score":0.4261188507},{"key-phrase":"building alteration pattern","score":0.4059122205},{"key-phrase":"building permit data","score":0.3999472857},{"key-phrase":"Building alteration","score":0.391087234},{"key-phrase":"new building","score":0.389005959},{"key-phrase":"data mining","score":0.3551852703},{"key-phrase":"construction activity","score":0.3538786769},{"key-phrase":"knowledge discovery process","score":0.3249967396},{"key-phrase":"thematic structure","score":0.3225435019},{"key-phrase":"thematic pattern","score":0.2963885367},{"key-phrase":"popular word","score":0.2595121861},{"key-phrase":"permit typology","score":0.2351291776},{"key-phrase":"available land","score":0.2287624031},{"key-phrase":"popularity change","score":0.2255046666},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic dynamic","score":0.2251395285},{"key-phrase":"alteration project","score":0.2095702887},{"key-phrase":"local contexts","score":0.2094754875},{"key-phrase":"database structure","score":0.2081189454},{"key-phrase":"economic growth","score":0.2016060054},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal pattern","score":0.1979922801},{"key-phrase":"data accessibility","score":0.1977321804},{"key-phrase":"collective understanding","score":0.1884817779},{"key-phrase":"permit description","score":0.1843467653},{"key-phrase":"co-appearance likelihood","score":0.1790391803},{"key-phrase":"environmental implication","score":0.1732332706},{"key-phrase":"alteration","score":0.1483420134},{"key-phrase":"ancillary data","score":0.1428973079},{"key-phrase":"permit record","score":0.1372749507},{"key-phrase":"permit","score":0.1303342879},{"key-phrase":"generalizable approach","score":0.091884248},{"key-phrase":"leading indicator","score":0.083890453},{"key-phrase":"significant barrier","score":0.0550961271},{"key-phrase":"central role","score":-0.0103240181}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":325,"Cited by":70.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Measuring daily accessed street greenery: A human-scale approach for informing better urban planning practices","Abstract":"The public benefits of visible street greenery have been well recognised in a growing literature. Nevertheless, this issue was rare to be included into urban greenery and planning practices. As a response to this situation, we proposed an actionable approach for quantifying the daily exposure of urban residents to eye-level street greenery by integrating high resolution measurements on both greenery and accessibility. Google Street View (GSV) images in Singapore were collected and extracted through machine learning algorithms to achieve an accurate measurement on visible greenery. Street networks collected from Open Street Map (OSM) were analysed through spatial design network analysis (sDNA) to quantify the accessibility value of each street. The integration of street greenery and accessibility helps to measure greenery from a human-centred perspective, and it provides a decision-support tool for urban planners to highlight areas with prioritisation for planning interventions. Moreover, the performance between GSV-based street greenery and the urban green cover mapped by remote sensing was compared to justify the contribution of this new measurement. It suggested there was a mismatch between these two measurements, i.e., existing top-down viewpoint through satellites might not be equivalent to the benefits enjoyed by city residents. In short, this analytical approach contributes to a growing trend in integrating large, freely-available datasets with machine learning to inform planners, and it makes a step forward for urban planning practices through focusing on the human-scale measurement of accessed street greenery. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Accessible greenery; Google Street View; Human-scale; Machine learning; Space syntax; Visible greenery","Authors":"Ye Y., Richards D., Lu Y., Song X., Zhuang Y., Zeng W., Zhong T.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.028","x":7.52,"y":-4.45,"KeyPhrases":["visible street greenery","spatial design network","urban planning practice","machine learning","accessibility value"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"visible street greenery","score":0.6305507421},{"key-phrase":"urban greenery","score":0.6223540902},{"key-phrase":"street greenery","score":0.5888010263},{"key-phrase":"level street greenery","score":0.5786312819},{"key-phrase":"Google Street View","score":0.4883210659},{"key-phrase":"urban planning practice","score":0.4715639353},{"key-phrase":"visible greenery","score":0.4351879358},{"key-phrase":"Open Street Map","score":0.434559226},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3974390924},{"key-phrase":"spatial design network","score":0.3766009212},{"key-phrase":"urban green cover","score":0.3667331934},{"key-phrase":"greenery","score":0.350627929},{"key-phrase":"Street network","score":0.3116152287},{"key-phrase":"street","score":0.3011008799},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2803792357},{"key-phrase":"urban resident","score":0.2648532689},{"key-phrase":"planning practice","score":0.2597791553},{"key-phrase":"city resident","score":0.2443259954},{"key-phrase":"accessibility value","score":0.2305462658},{"key-phrase":"public benefit","score":0.2166435421},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.2040607333},{"key-phrase":"human-centred perspective","score":0.1925287396},{"key-phrase":"top-down viewpoint","score":0.1856274009},{"key-phrase":"human-scale measurement","score":0.1780503392},{"key-phrase":"available datasets","score":0.1694979966},{"key-phrase":"daily exposure","score":0.1503599286},{"key-phrase":"analytical approach","score":0.1250712872},{"key-phrase":"accurate measurement","score":0.1206639633},{"key-phrase":"actionable approach","score":0.0981725007},{"key-phrase":"high resolution measurement","score":0.0861152709},{"key-phrase":"new measurement","score":0.0729276016},{"key-phrase":"support tool","score":0.0334231108}]},{"Cluster":5,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":326,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Integrating geovisual analytics with machine learning for human mobility pattern discovery","Abstract":"Understanding human movement patterns is of fundamental importance in transportation planning and management. We propose to examine complex public transit travel patterns over a large-scale transit network, which is challenging since it involves thousands of transit passengers and massive data from heterogeneous sources. Additionally, efficient representation and visualization of discovered travel patterns is difficult given a large number of transit trips. To address these challenges, this study leverages advanced machine learning methods to identify time-varying mobility patterns based on smart card data and other urban data. The proposed approach delivers a comprehensive solution to pre-process, analyze, and visualize complex public transit travel patterns. This approach first fuses smart card data with other urban data to reconstruct original transit trips.We use two machine learning methods, including a clustering algorithm to extract transit corridors to represent primarymobility connections between different regions and a graph-embedding algorithmto discover hierarchical mobility community structures.We also devise compact and effective multi-scale visualization forms to represent the discovered travel behavior dynamics. An interactive web-based mapping prototype is developed to integrate advanced machine learning methods with specific visualizations to characterize transit travel behavior patterns and to enable visual exploration of transit mobility patterns at different scales and resolutions over space and time. The proposed approach is evaluated using multi-source big transit data (e.g., smart card data, transit network data, and bus trajectory data) collected in Shenzhen City, China. Evaluation of our prototype demonstrates that the proposed visual analytics approach offers a scalable and effective solution for discovering meaningful travel patterns across large metropolitan areas. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Geovisual analytics; Machine learning; Mobility community; Smart card data; Transit corridor; Trip","Authors":"Zhang T., Wang J., Cui C., Li Y., He W., Lu Y., Qiao Q.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi8110489","x":5.6,"y":-2.8,"KeyPhrases":["transit mobility pattern","visual analytics","smart card data","other urban data","clustering algorithm"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"transit mobility pattern","score":0.5768731833},{"key-phrase":"transit network data","score":0.5662770271},{"key-phrase":"multi-source big transit data","score":0.5658669472},{"key-phrase":"complex public transit travel","score":0.5310127735},{"key-phrase":"bus trajectory data","score":0.5072809458},{"key-phrase":"meaningful travel pattern","score":0.4743450582},{"key-phrase":"transit travel behavior","score":0.4688169956},{"key-phrase":"travel behavior dynamic","score":0.4577620029},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical mobility community","score":0.4499419332},{"key-phrase":"transit corridor","score":0.4366548657},{"key-phrase":"transportation planning","score":0.4274080396},{"key-phrase":"travel pattern","score":0.4220805466},{"key-phrase":"visual analytics","score":0.4209302664},{"key-phrase":"other urban data","score":0.414801985},{"key-phrase":"transit passenger","score":0.3862389922},{"key-phrase":"large-scale transit","score":0.3830265403},{"key-phrase":"transit","score":0.3734709918},{"key-phrase":"specific visualization","score":0.3401147127},{"key-phrase":"clustering algorithm","score":0.3381609917},{"key-phrase":"mobility pattern","score":0.3378152251},{"key-phrase":"massive data","score":0.3352106512},{"key-phrase":"transit trip","score":0.3291995525},{"key-phrase":"travel","score":0.3181368709},{"key-phrase":"visual exploration","score":0.3175864518},{"key-phrase":"large metropolitan area","score":0.3159958124},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.3121914268},{"key-phrase":"advanced machine learning","score":0.3065797687},{"key-phrase":"human movement pattern","score":0.2793082893},{"key-phrase":"original transit","score":0.255839169},{"key-phrase":"smart card data","score":0.2522748709},{"key-phrase":"effective multi-scale visualization form","score":0.2516856194},{"key-phrase":"embedding algorithmto","score":0.20265311},{"key-phrase":"mapping prototype","score":0.1924165934},{"key-phrase":"Shenzhen City","score":0.1908914894},{"key-phrase":"efficient representation","score":0.1813705117},{"key-phrase":"interactive web","score":0.1716197431},{"key-phrase":"scalable and effective solution","score":0.1671946496},{"key-phrase":"different scale","score":0.1103994027},{"key-phrase":"large number","score":0.1021891758},{"key-phrase":"different region","score":0.0926314294},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous source","score":0.0687038079},{"key-phrase":"primarymobility connection","score":0.0661164671},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive solution","score":0.0568070412},{"key-phrase":"fundamental importance","score":0.0463263392}]},{"Cluster":14,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":327,"Cited by":12.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Aerial point cloud classification with deep learning and machine learning algorithms","Abstract":"With recent advances in technology, 3D point clouds are getting more and more frequently requested and used, not only for visualization needs but also e.g. by public administrations for urban planning and management. 3D point clouds are also a very frequent source for generating 3D city models which became recently more available for many applications, such as urban development plans, energy evaluation, navigation, visibility analysis and numerous other GIS studies.

However, the urban suitability index (USI) map produced from the conventional CA-MC is either affected by human bias or cannot accurately reflect the possible nonlinear relations between driving factors and urban expansion. To overcome these limitations, a machine learning model (Artificial Neural Network, ANN) was integrated with CA-MC instead of the commonly used Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Logistic Regression (LR) CA-MC models. The ANN was optimized to create the USI map and then integrated with CA-MC to spatially allocate urban expansion cells. The validated results of kappa and fuzzy kappa simulation indicate that ANN-CA-MC outperformed other variously coupled CA-MC modelling approaches.

In this study, we used three statistical models [frequency ratio, certainty factor and index of entropy (IOE)] and a machine learning model [random forest (RF)] for landslide susceptibility mapping in Wanzhou County, China. First, a landslide inventory map was prepared using earlier geotechnical investigation reports, aerial images, and field surveys. Then, the redundant factors were excluded from the initial fourteen landslide causal factors via factor correlation analysis. To determine the most effective causal factors, landslide susceptibility evaluations were performed based on four cases with different combinations of factors (\u201ccases\u201d). In the analysis, 465 (70%) landslide locations were randomly selected for model training, and 200 (30%) landslide locations were selected for verification. The results showed that case 3 produced the best performance for the statistical models and that case 2 produced the best performance for the RF model.

The ROC curve analysis showed that the machine learning model performed better than the other three models, and among the three statistical models, the IOE model with weight coefficients was superior. \u00a9 2019, Science Press and Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Four cases; Landslide susceptibility mapping; Machine learning model; Statistical model","Authors":"Xiao T., Yin K., Yao T., Liu S.","DOI":"10.1007\/s11631-019-00341-1","x":13.0799999237,"y":3.7699999809,"KeyPhrases":["Landslide susceptibility mapping","random forest","urban planning","certainty factor","geotechnical investigation report"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Landslide susceptibility mapping","score":0.6985940337},{"key-phrase":"landslide susceptibility evaluation","score":0.6728080511},{"key-phrase":"landslide risk management","score":0.6340857744},{"key-phrase":"landslide inventory map","score":0.513246417},{"key-phrase":"landslide location","score":0.4868294001},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4716418982},{"key-phrase":"geotechnical investigation report","score":0.3952779472},{"key-phrase":"landslide","score":0.3723844886},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.355830133},{"key-phrase":"ROC curve analysis","score":0.349039495},{"key-phrase":"certainty factor","score":0.2922622561},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2754350007},{"key-phrase":"statistical model","score":0.2577418983},{"key-phrase":"Wanzhou County","score":0.1984372437},{"key-phrase":"factor correlation analysis","score":0.1933967769},{"key-phrase":"model training","score":0.1725910008},{"key-phrase":"effective causal factor","score":0.1634773612},{"key-phrase":"weight coefficient","score":0.1499806046},{"key-phrase":"field survey","score":0.1448758096},{"key-phrase":"causal factor","score":0.1428238004},{"key-phrase":"aerial image","score":0.1389360875},{"key-phrase":"RF model","score":0.1057116389},{"key-phrase":"respective optimal case","score":0.0930933282},{"key-phrase":"frequency ratio","score":0.0854355246},{"key-phrase":"redundant factor","score":0.0712741762},{"key-phrase":"IOE model","score":0.0541142412},{"key-phrase":"different combination","score":0.007726281},{"key-phrase":"IOE","score":-0.0628981367}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":330,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"THE POTENTIAL of BUILDING DETECTION from SAR and LIDAR USING DEEP LEARNING","Abstract":"The introduction of airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) approach has successfully addressed several challenges for mapping and surveying applications Unlike other conventional sensors, airborne SAR mapping approach offers practicality and significant cost savings for the nation minimizing the need for ground control points on the ground in addition to providing high-resolution, day-and-night, cloud coverage and weather independent images, which in turn provides faster turnaround times for creation of large area geospatial data. Up-to-date building map is necessary to guide the decision making in many fields to understand the urban dynamics such as in disaster management, population estimation, planning and many other applications. Whilst mapping and surveying work using airborne SAR have started to capture many interest among surveyors, professionals and practitioners abroad, Malaysia however is still lacking behind in term of the knowledge and the usage of this technology together with Deep Learning, Machine Learning approach especially in building extraction for topographic mapping and urban planning and development. Deep learning is a subset of the machine learning algorithm. Recently, Deep Learning has been proposed to solve traditional artificial intelligent problems. In order to develop a sustainable national geospatial infrastructure for years to come, the integration between airborne SAR and other sensors as such LIDAR is therefore essential in Malaysia and in high demand for urban planning and management.

Therefore, the security of the IoT system needs to be considered, this is related to data integrity, privacy, service stability. Through intrusion detection, activities on the IoT system will be able to be analyzed whether there are suspicious activities that can interfere with or threaten IoT services. In several previous studies in the literature, the approach used to detect intrusions in the IoT system has a high false alarm rate. This research proposes an approach through machine learning, specifically the ensemble learning approach and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) method as a method of detecting intrusions in the IoT system which is expected to produce better performance. The results of this study indicate that the proposed approach is able to detect intrusion and classify into five types of intrusion including normal intrusion, probe, dos, r2l, u2r. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed approach can improve the performance of intrusion detection in terms of accuracy to 97.02%, detection rate of 97%, false alarm rate 0.16%, compared to base learning and approaches in previous studies used as intrusion detection methods, but in processing time performance have not shown satisfying results. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Audit; Ensemble learning; Intrusion Detection; IoT; Machine learning","Authors":"Kurniawan A.A., Santoso H.A., Soeleman M.A., Fanani A.Z.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICSITech46713.2019.8987524","x":3.3399999142,"y":2.7799999714,"KeyPhrases":["intrusion detection method","IoT service","synthetic minority","ensemble learning approach","false alarm rate"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"intrusion detection method","score":0.5710030198},{"key-phrase":"intrusion detection","score":0.5597473383},{"key-phrase":"IoT system","score":0.4471491575},{"key-phrase":"IoT service","score":0.4425656497},{"key-phrase":"iot","score":0.424562335},{"key-phrase":"ensemble learning approach","score":0.4201293588},{"key-phrase":"high false alarm rate","score":0.3562242389},{"key-phrase":"false alarm rate","score":0.355938375},{"key-phrase":"normal intrusion","score":0.3356294036},{"key-phrase":"intrusion","score":0.3187964559},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2991148829},{"key-phrase":"synthetic minority","score":0.283667326},{"key-phrase":"base learning","score":0.2800544798},{"key-phrase":"suspicious activity","score":0.2725787759},{"key-phrase":"data integrity","score":0.2121913731},{"key-phrase":"industrial revolution","score":0.1798944473},{"key-phrase":"service stability","score":0.1306090355},{"key-phrase":"detection rate","score":0.1151129082},{"key-phrase":"processing time performance","score":0.0976527259},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.0653542429},{"key-phrase":"health manufacturing","score":0.0531083718},{"key-phrase":"several previous study","score":0.0506283417},{"key-phrase":"evaluation result","score":0.04561406},{"key-phrase":"previous study","score":-0.0129542751},{"key-phrase":"satisfying result","score":-0.0261856709}]},{"Cluster":14,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":333,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Machine Learning for Strategic Urban Planning","Abstract":"Data mining is an important part of strategic planning for the development of modern urban settlement with capacities to accommodate population explosion.

Although public policy promotes transport alternatives and new infrastructure, traffic congestion is highly prevalent and continues to be the lead cause for numerous social, economic and environmental issues. Although a significant volume of research has been reported on road traffic prediction, profiling of traffic has received much less attention. In this paper we address two key problems in traffic profiling by proposing a novel unsupervised incremental learning approach for road traffic congestion detection and profiling, dynamically over time. This approach uses (a) hyperdimensional computing to enable capture variable-length trajectories of commuter trips represented as vehicular movement across intersections, and (b) transforms these into feature vectors that can be incrementally learned over time by the Incremental Knowledge Acquiring Self-Learning (IKASL) algorithm. The proposed approach was tested and evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 190 million vehicular movement records obtained from 1,400 Bluetooth identifiers placed at the intersections of the arterial road network in the State of Victoria, Australia. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Bandaragoda T., De Silva D., Kleyko D., Osipov E., Wiklund U., Alahakoon D.","DOI":"10.1109\/ITSC.2019.8917320","x":5.33,"y":-2.01,"KeyPhrases":["road traffic prediction","unsupervised incremental learning approach","hyperdimensional computing","Bluetooth identifier","profiling"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"road traffic prediction","score":0.6272583604},{"key-phrase":"traffic profiling","score":0.570889473},{"key-phrase":"Road traffic congestion","score":0.5020102262},{"key-phrase":"traffic congestion","score":0.4882386923},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised incremental learning approach","score":0.4513759613},{"key-phrase":"vehicular movement record","score":0.4298651218},{"key-phrase":"traffic","score":0.4236513376},{"key-phrase":"vehicular movement","score":0.3804863691},{"key-phrase":"Incremental Knowledge","score":0.3797373772},{"key-phrase":"commuter trip","score":0.3781371117},{"key-phrase":"hyperdimensional computing","score":0.3578864932},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3366921544},{"key-phrase":"feature vector","score":0.3239081502},{"key-phrase":"arterial road network","score":0.3029361367},{"key-phrase":"profiling","score":0.258251071},{"key-phrase":"new infrastructure","score":0.215860948},{"key-phrase":"transport alternative","score":0.1709352136},{"key-phrase":"variable-length trajectory","score":0.138138175},{"key-phrase":"Bluetooth identifier","score":0.1188531518},{"key-phrase":"significant volume","score":0.0958193988},{"key-phrase":"complex challenge","score":0.0724176764},{"key-phrase":"economic and environmental issue","score":0.0518652312},{"key-phrase":"public policy","score":0.0457300693},{"key-phrase":"lead cause","score":0.0273512751},{"key-phrase":"key problem","score":0.0152609888}]},{"Cluster":25,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":335,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Quantitative relationship model of express service network and service facilities in Beijing","Abstract":"This paper intends to propose a quantitative relationship model in the layout between express service network and other life service facilities.

For centuries, understanding these places has been limited to sporadic observations and laborious data collection. This study proposes a novel methodology to analyze citywide, discrete urban spaces using highly accurate anonymized telecom data and machine learning algorithms. Through superposition of human dynamics and urban features, this work aims to expose clear correlations between the design of the city and the behavioral patterns of its users. Geolocated telecom data, obtained for the state of Andorra, were initially analyzed to identify \u201cstay-points\u201d\u2014events in which cellular devices remain within a certain roaming distance for a given length of time. These stay-points were then further analyzed to find clusters of activity characterized in terms of their size, persistence, and diversity. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify associations between the formation of these clusters and various urban features such as urban morphology or land-use within a 25\u201350 meters resolution. Some of the urban features that were found to be highly related to the creation of large, diverse and long-lasting clusters were the presence of service and entertainment amenities, natural water features, and the betweenness centrality of the road network; others, such as educational and park amenities were shown to have a negative impact. Ultimately, this study suggests a \u201creversed urbanism\u201d methodology: an evidence-based approach to urban design, planning, and decision making, in which human behavioral patterns are instilled as a foundational design tool for inferring the success rates of highly performative urban places. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.","Author Keywords":"human dynamics; machine learning; spatial analysis; telecom data; Urban design","Authors":"Noyman A., Doorley R., Xiong Z., Alonso L., Grignard A., Larson K.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808319840668","x":6.71,"y":-3.6,"KeyPhrases":["discrete urban space","clear correlation","Geolocated telecom data","machine learning algorithms","stay"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"discrete urban space","score":0.5915863514},{"key-phrase":"various urban feature","score":0.5725257397},{"key-phrase":"urban design","score":0.5688611269},{"key-phrase":"urban morphology","score":0.5600149632},{"key-phrase":"dynamic and urban feature","score":0.5382401347},{"key-phrase":"urban feature","score":0.5204105377},{"key-phrase":"performative urban place","score":0.5097628832},{"key-phrase":"successful public space","score":0.4758494496},{"key-phrase":"Geolocated telecom data","score":0.42365098},{"key-phrase":"telecom data","score":0.3665784299},{"key-phrase":"park amenity","score":0.3248845339},{"key-phrase":"road network","score":0.3196032941},{"key-phrase":"betweenness centrality","score":0.3136341572},{"key-phrase":"human behavioral pattern","score":0.3019989729},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.2849267125},{"key-phrase":"laborious data collection","score":0.2822722197},{"key-phrase":"entertainment amenity","score":0.2581986487},{"key-phrase":"telecom","score":0.2482251823},{"key-phrase":"cellular device","score":0.2183357626},{"key-phrase":"Multivariate linear regression model","score":0.2049009055},{"key-phrase":"novel methodology","score":0.1874572635},{"key-phrase":"behavioral pattern","score":0.1867902428},{"key-phrase":"stay","score":0.1835184991},{"key-phrase":"clear correlation","score":0.1691918671},{"key-phrase":"fundamental aspect","score":0.1482765973},{"key-phrase":"natural water feature","score":0.1366861016},{"key-phrase":"decision making","score":0.130366087},{"key-phrase":"foundational design tool","score":0.1287149638},{"key-phrase":"sporadic observation","score":0.1267252266},{"key-phrase":"success rate","score":0.0824050084},{"key-phrase":"negative impact","score":0.0680510551},{"key-phrase":"long-lasting_VBG cluster","score":0.0678820163},{"key-phrase":"meter resolution","score":0.0288515259}]},{"Cluster":21,"Score":0.8613670192,"DocId":338,"Cited by":29.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Examining threshold effects of built environment elements on travel-related carbon-dioxide emissions","Abstract":"Understanding how built environment features are associated with travel-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions is essential for planners to encourage environmentally sustainable travel through transportation and land use policies. Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range. These threshold effects offer valuable implications for planners to achieve desirable environmental benefits efficiently. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Machine learning; Travel behavior; Urban form","Authors":"Wu X., Tao T., Cao J., Fan Y., Ramaswami A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.trd.2019.08.018","x":5.9899997711,"y":3.7599999905,"KeyPhrases":["sustainable travel","decision tree","environment determinant","metropolitan area","CO2 emission"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"sustainable travel","score":0.4279333949},{"key-phrase":"CO2 emission","score":0.3699610233},{"key-phrase":"environment determinant","score":0.3664457202},{"key-phrase":"desirable environmental benefit","score":0.3406041563},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3175267279},{"key-phrase":"land use diversity","score":0.3052782416},{"key-phrase":"environment factor","score":0.3008229733},{"key-phrase":"land use policy","score":0.282815218},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan area","score":0.2572618127},{"key-phrase":"transit stop","score":0.2360746264},{"key-phrase":"built environment feature","score":0.2093632817},{"key-phrase":"emission","score":0.1818438768},{"key-phrase":"job density","score":0.1757549644},{"key-phrase":"environment variable","score":0.174487859},{"key-phrase":"threshold effect","score":0.1491042227},{"key-phrase":"environment element","score":0.0955875963},{"key-phrase":"substantial impact","score":0.0944124907},{"key-phrase":"threshold effect offer","score":0.0867552459},{"key-phrase":"certain range","score":0.080096066},{"key-phrase":"valuable implication","score":0.057328023},{"key-phrase":"built","score":0.0156942196},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0029680766}]},{"Cluster":19,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":339,"Cited by":13.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Impact of community deprivation on urban park access over time: Understanding the relative role of contributors for urban planning","Abstract":"As an important element of urban landscapes, park plays an important role in building environmentally sustainable cities. Thus, it is important to examine park accessibility and how it changes over time in relation to community deprivation so as to provide all residents with equitable services. Using the Gaussian-based 2SFCA (two-step floating catchment area) method, this paper analyzes dynamic park accessibility from 2016 to 2018 for communities within the Hangzhou metropolitan area in China and then quantifies the relative role of local contributors to park accessibility changes (population, park and transport network). A machine learning algorithm, which handles the interdependences of deprivation dimensions, is further employed to determine the relationship between community deprivation and park accessibility changes. Results show that park accessibility continued to grow during the study period, and most communities achieved excellent park accessibility by 2018. Population decreases and park increases contribute positively to improved park accessibility, while transport network changes have had less of an impact. Deprived communities have observed a rising trend of park accessibility, while the elderly concentrated communities are more likely to experience declined park accessibility. Our study provides a new methodological framework, which integrates the geographical accessibility model, economic chain substitution model and machine learning algorithm, for understanding the dynamic park access and associated social inequalities in rapidly urbanizing regions. The lessons learned from this study should be insightful for urban planning. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Accessibility; Dynamic changes; Green spaces; Hangzhou; Neighborhood SES; Park; Social deprivation","Authors":"Li Z., Wei H., Wu Y., Su S., Wang W., Qu C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2019.102031","x":6.6199998856,"y":4.3299999237,"KeyPhrases":["geographical accessibility model","park increase","machine learning algorithm","sustainable city","community deprivation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"geographical accessibility model","score":0.515873313},{"key-phrase":"park accessibility","score":0.5082480311},{"key-phrase":"park accessibility change","score":0.4969438314},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4801267684},{"key-phrase":"excellent park accessibility","score":0.4764820337},{"key-phrase":"dynamic park accessibility","score":0.465808332},{"key-phrase":"urban landscape","score":0.4326242208},{"key-phrase":"sustainable city","score":0.4286894798},{"key-phrase":"dynamic park access","score":0.4126292467},{"key-phrase":"park increase","score":0.3761186004},{"key-phrase":"park","score":0.3671768904},{"key-phrase":"catchment area","score":0.3516274989},{"key-phrase":"Deprived community","score":0.3369715512},{"key-phrase":"community deprivation","score":0.3196992278},{"key-phrase":"elderly concentrated community","score":0.287591517},{"key-phrase":"social inequality","score":0.2787516713},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan area","score":0.2597309053},{"key-phrase":"Population decrease","score":0.2596710026},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.2487065941},{"key-phrase":"deprivation dimension","score":0.227945894},{"key-phrase":"economic chain substitution","score":0.2240503132},{"key-phrase":"accessibility","score":0.2236868441},{"key-phrase":"transport network change","score":0.2220077962},{"key-phrase":"new methodological framework","score":0.1928859353},{"key-phrase":"transport network","score":0.1830311716},{"key-phrase":"equitable service","score":0.1295035332},{"key-phrase":"local contributor","score":0.0800245181},{"key-phrase":"important element","score":0.0682521239},{"key-phrase":"relative role","score":0.0637420416},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0454130098},{"key-phrase":"study period","score":-0.0243621171}]},{"Cluster":9,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":340,"Cited by":34.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The visual quality of streets: A human-centred continuous measurement based on machine learning algorithms and street view images","Abstract":"This study proposes a workable approach for quantitatively measuring the perceptual-based visual quality of streets, which has often relied on subjective impressions or feelings. With the help of recently emerged street view images and machine learning algorithms, an evaluation model has been trained to assess the perceived visual quality with accuracy similar to that of experienced urban designers, to provide full coverage and detailed results for a citywide area. The town centre of Shanghai was selected for the site. Around 140,000 screenshots from Baidu Street View were processed and a machine learning algorithm, SegNet, was applied to intelligently extract the pixels representing key elements affecting the visual quality of streets, including the building frontage, greenery, sky view, pedestrian space, motorisation, and diversity. A Java-based program was then produced to automatically collect the preferences of experienced urban designers on representative sample images. Another machine learning algorithm, i.e. an artificial neural network, was used to train an evaluation model to achieve a citywide, high-resolution evaluation of the visual quality of the streets. Further validation through different approaches shows this evaluation model obtains a satisfactory accuracy. The results from the artificial neural network also help to explore the high or low effects of various key elements on visual quality. In short, this study contributes to the development of human-centred planning and design by providing continuous measurements of an \u2018unmeasurable\u2019 quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights on the perceptual-based visual quality and detailed mapping of various key elements in streets can assist in more efficient street renewal by providing accurate design guidance. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.","Author Keywords":"machine learning; street; Street view images; urban design; visual quality","Authors":"Ye Y., Zeng W., Shen Q., Zhang X., Lu Y.","DOI":"10.1177\/2399808319828734","x":7.49,"y":-4.89,"KeyPhrases":["perceptual-based visual quality","Baidu Street View","machine learning algorithms","experienced urban designer","efficient street renewal"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"perceptual-based visual quality","score":0.5274044871},{"key-phrase":"visual quality","score":0.5147486925},{"key-phrase":"street view image","score":0.5056119561},{"key-phrase":"Baidu Street View","score":0.4979589581},{"key-phrase":"efficient street renewal","score":0.4492639899},{"key-phrase":"experienced urban designer","score":0.4380683303},{"key-phrase":"representative sample image","score":0.3585156202},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian space","score":0.344940722},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.3334614038},{"key-phrase":"subjective impression","score":0.321030736},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.302018255},{"key-phrase":"street","score":0.2994757295},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution evaluation","score":0.2972474992},{"key-phrase":"visual","score":0.2785905302},{"key-phrase":"sky view","score":0.2657788992},{"key-phrase":"human-centred planning","score":0.2612750828},{"key-phrase":"detailed mapping","score":0.259763062},{"key-phrase":"citywide area","score":0.2566347718},{"key-phrase":"large-scale area","score":0.2527998388},{"key-phrase":"building frontage","score":0.2386370301},{"key-phrase":"accurate design guidance","score":0.2337896526},{"key-phrase":"satisfactory accuracy","score":0.2302451581},{"key-phrase":"evaluation model","score":0.2141060829},{"key-phrase":"town centre","score":0.1881593764},{"key-phrase":"continuous measurement","score":0.0955272391},{"key-phrase":"Further validation","score":0.0941103101},{"key-phrase":"detailed result","score":0.0705059916},{"key-phrase":"various key element","score":0.0630994439},{"key-phrase":"low effect","score":0.0611950122},{"key-phrase":"workable approach","score":0.0518137291},{"key-phrase":"full coverage","score":0.0441246182},{"key-phrase":"key element","score":0.0397888459},{"key-phrase":"different approach","score":0.0244260281}]},{"Cluster":10,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":341,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A LARGE SCALE CLASSIFICATION of PUBLIC SPACES USING A STUDY of PERCEPTION and PUBLIC DATA from INEGI of the CITY of PUEBLA, SAN PEDRO CHOLULA and SAN ANDRES CHOLULA","Abstract":"This work aims to create a methodology to automatize the classification of public spaces using a perception test and data obtained from city census information, in our case, from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI).

Thus, it is important to take note of the time where investments in new technologies directed at the safety of the railway enable safety and protection in this area. Novel technological techniques such as big data analysis (BDA), data mining or machine learning (ML) have been developed and applied in many areas such as sales, banking and healthcare. The development of such methods has important benefits within the context of railway safety, however, these new methods need to be implemented and developed with consideration of whether these operational models can help to solve the various difficulties that currently exist in the risk analysis of railway stations. Moreover, as the adoption of the Internet of thing (IoT) grows, it is expected that analytical needs for handling data will also increase. It has been shown that the progression towards automation and applying such innovative new technologies such as BDA may be a powerful tool for integration in the future of transportation in general and the railway industry in particular, whereby analytical predictions can aid in the development of safer railway stations which have greater potential for ensuring the safety of passengers. In this paper a Bow Tie (BT) framework model has been created to combine BDA into the risk assessment process. The BDA can be beneficial to the risk assessment, support the decision makers in real time, and reduce human errors. This method can be fully integrated into passenger data and the business model for the railway station. Employing the existing safety records utilizing BDA is expected to mitigate risks, predict hazards, raise safety and security efficiency and reduce the cost. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Alawad H., Kaewunruen S., Min A.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/603\/5\/052031","x":6.06,"y":-2.14,"KeyPhrases":["railway safety","big data analysis","passenger data","risk assessment process","Bow Tie"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"railway safety","score":0.5838036537},{"key-phrase":"big data analysis","score":0.4505780935},{"key-phrase":"risk analysis","score":0.4411999583},{"key-phrase":"data mining","score":0.4388852119},{"key-phrase":"risk assessment","score":0.4329128861},{"key-phrase":"railway industry","score":0.4198583961},{"key-phrase":"railway","score":0.400467962},{"key-phrase":"passenger data","score":0.3982215524},{"key-phrase":"risk assessment process","score":0.3979643583},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3756527901},{"key-phrase":"analytical prediction","score":0.3584071994},{"key-phrase":"safety record","score":0.3278300762},{"key-phrase":"substantial railway station","score":0.3117326498},{"key-phrase":"railway station","score":0.2879267931},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.253223896},{"key-phrase":"operational model","score":0.2517505884},{"key-phrase":"analytical need","score":0.2324355543},{"key-phrase":"framework model","score":0.2045173645},{"key-phrase":"security efficiency","score":0.2043734789},{"key-phrase":"business model","score":0.1985124499},{"key-phrase":"powerful tool","score":0.1940560639},{"key-phrase":"innovative new technology","score":0.1905054003},{"key-phrase":"new technology","score":0.18895109},{"key-phrase":"BDA","score":0.1707481891},{"key-phrase":"Novel technological technique","score":0.1655043364},{"key-phrase":"Bow Tie","score":0.1598244905},{"key-phrase":"new method","score":0.1443798542},{"key-phrase":"human error","score":0.1318219602},{"key-phrase":"many area","score":0.129777357},{"key-phrase":"real time","score":0.1142293662},{"key-phrase":"such method","score":0.0881196186},{"key-phrase":"important benefit","score":0.0649570376},{"key-phrase":"various difficulty","score":0.0553030707}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":344,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Investigating adoption patterns of residential low impact development (LID) using classification trees","Abstract":"Local governments are under pressure to improve storm water management and often times must comply with consent decrees with the Federal Government.

Both methodologies face limitations, with knowledge-based approaches being criticized for scalability and transferability issues and data-driven approaches for lacking interpretability and depending heavily on data quality. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework that fuses a knowledge-based approach using design patterns and a data-driven approach using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in three different ways: Functional regions discovered using either approach are evaluated against each other to identify cases of significant agreement or disagreement; knowledge from patterns is used to adjust topic probabilities in the learning model; and topic probabilities are used to adjust pattern-based results. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated through the use case of identifying shopping-related regions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results show that the combination of pattern-based discovery and topic modeling extraction helps uncover discrepancies between the two approaches and smooth inaccuracies caused by the limitations of each approach. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Functional region; Patterns; Place; Topic modeling; Urban planning; Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)","Authors":"Papadakis E., Gao S., Baryannis G.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi8090385","x":6.19,"y":-3.46,"KeyPhrases":["latent Dirichlet allocation","urban planning","machine learning model","similar region","design pattern"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"latent Dirichlet allocation","score":0.5652974844},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4969953895},{"key-phrase":"topic modeling","score":0.4847327769},{"key-phrase":"topic modeling extraction","score":0.4773450792},{"key-phrase":"topic probability","score":0.365650773},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.352306366},{"key-phrase":"urban setting","score":0.3137280047},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan area","score":0.3099184632},{"key-phrase":"learning model","score":0.2936536074},{"key-phrase":"similar region","score":0.2787196338},{"key-phrase":"design pattern","score":0.2678577006},{"key-phrase":"topic","score":0.2366650105},{"key-phrase":"expert knowledge","score":0.2191229165},{"key-phrase":"Functional region","score":0.2149636894},{"key-phrase":"general methodology","score":0.178200841},{"key-phrase":"novel framework","score":0.1725506186},{"key-phrase":"significant agreement","score":0.1674623787},{"key-phrase":"Los Angeles","score":0.160670504},{"key-phrase":"knowledge","score":0.155016616},{"key-phrase":"particular functionality","score":0.1243057996},{"key-phrase":"use case","score":0.1133911908},{"key-phrase":"data quality","score":0.1022607461},{"key-phrase":"transferability issue","score":0.0708650574},{"key-phrase":"methodology face limitation","score":0.0648868158},{"key-phrase":"Result show","score":0.0313395225},{"key-phrase":"different way","score":-0.0033310819},{"key-phrase":"smooth inaccuracy","score":-0.0384905823}]},{"Cluster":3,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":346,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Enhanced urban clustering in VANETs using online machine learning","Abstract":"Clustering in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) is essential to mitigate different challenges and meet the required quality of communications. However, most of the available clustering protocols were designed for highways, and thus become unstable in realistic urban environments with many intersections. In this paper, a Clustering Adaptation Near Intersection (CANI) approach is proposed to ensure clustering stability at intersections. This approach exploits Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) to predict the behavior of the vehicles near an intersection and adapt the clusters accordingly. The main advantage of the developed OS-ELM prediction model is its ability to continuously learn and update in real time. After being validated, the proposed adaptation approach is included in a highway clustering scheme. The resultant clustering protocol is compared to other schemes in a realistic urban environment, and shows significant stability and efficiency performance improvement. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Clustering algorithm; Machine learning; Urban environment; VANET","Authors":"Alsuhli G.H., Khattab A., Fahmy Y.A., Massoud Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICVES.2019.8906296","x":5.31,"y":-1.92,"KeyPhrases":["highway clustering scheme","Online Sequential Extreme Learning","Hoc Networks","Vehicular Ad","ELM prediction model"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"highway clustering scheme","score":0.4630108476},{"key-phrase":"ELM prediction model","score":0.436300993},{"key-phrase":"Online Sequential Extreme Learning","score":0.419957608},{"key-phrase":"Clustering Adaptation Near","score":0.388229847},{"key-phrase":"Hoc Networks","score":0.3879359365},{"key-phrase":"clustering stability","score":0.3547337353},{"key-phrase":"resultant clustering protocol","score":0.3454984725},{"key-phrase":"available clustering protocol","score":0.3411604464},{"key-phrase":"clustering","score":0.2914876938},{"key-phrase":"Vehicular Ad","score":0.2803394198},{"key-phrase":"realistic urban environment","score":0.2312809676},{"key-phrase":"adaptation approach","score":0.2001880109},{"key-phrase":"many intersection","score":0.1608195156},{"key-phrase":"intersection","score":0.1545647383},{"key-phrase":"real time","score":0.1257638186},{"key-phrase":"efficiency performance improvement","score":0.0731562525},{"key-phrase":"significant stability","score":0.0630168468},{"key-phrase":"developed OS","score":0.0377126932},{"key-phrase":"other scheme","score":0.0198811013},{"key-phrase":"different challenge","score":0.0148084722},{"key-phrase":"required quality","score":-0.0367656574},{"key-phrase":"main advantage","score":-0.0726588666}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":347,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Understanding the spatial distribution of urban forests in China using Sentinel-2 images with Google Earth Engine","Abstract":"Urban forests are vitally important for sustainable urban development and the well-being of urban residents. However, there is, as yet, no country-level urban forest spatial dataset of sufficient quality for the scientific management of, and correlative studies on, urban forests in China. At present, China attaches great importance to the construction of urban forests, and it is necessary to map a high-resolution and high-accuracy dataset of urban forests in China. The open-access Sentinel images and the Google Earth Engine platform provide a significant opportunity for the realization of this work. This study used eight bands (B2-B8, B11) and three indices of Sentinel-2 in 2016 to map the urban forests of China using the Random Forest machine learning algorithms at the pixel scale with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The 7317 sample points for training and testing were collected from field visits and very high resolution images from Google Earth. The overall accuracy, producer's accuracy of urban forest, and user's accuracy of urban forest assessed by independent validation samples in this study were 92.30%, 92.27%, and 92.18%, respectively. In 2016, the percentage of urban forest cover was 19.2%. Nearly half of the cities had an urban forest cover between 10% and 20%, and the average percentage of large cities whose urban populations were over 5 million was 24.8%. Cities with less than half of the average were mainly distributed in northern and western parts of China, which should be focused on in urban greening planning. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"China; Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2; Urban area; Urban greening","Authors":"Duan Q., Tan M., Guo Y., Wang X., Xin L.","DOI":"10.3390\/f10090729","x":9.62,"y":-4.03,"KeyPhrases":["urban forest cover","Google Earth Engine","Random Forest machine","spatial dataset","average percentage"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban forest cover","score":0.6546092033},{"key-phrase":"Urban forest","score":0.5624501705},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest machine","score":0.4772920609},{"key-phrase":"forest","score":0.4401692152},{"key-phrase":"Google Earth Engine","score":0.4234283566},{"key-phrase":"urban greening planning","score":0.418561995},{"key-phrase":"sustainable urban development","score":0.3763014674},{"key-phrase":"Google Earth","score":0.3640965819},{"key-phrase":"urban population","score":0.3253518343},{"key-phrase":"spatial dataset","score":0.3142721653},{"key-phrase":"high-accuracy dataset","score":0.2677468657},{"key-phrase":"large city","score":0.262824297},{"key-phrase":"urban resident","score":0.230365932},{"key-phrase":"user's accuracy","score":0.2187830508},{"key-phrase":"open-access Sentinel","score":0.2007993758},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.197170943},{"key-phrase":"china","score":0.1639263779},{"key-phrase":"high resolution image","score":0.1615773141},{"key-phrase":"producer's accuracy","score":0.1437692642},{"key-phrase":"northern and western part","score":0.1328583509},{"key-phrase":"independent validation sample","score":0.1042736098},{"key-phrase":"pixel scale","score":0.1040960029},{"key-phrase":"average percentage","score":0.0842049122},{"key-phrase":"field visit","score":0.0771066919},{"key-phrase":"sample point","score":0.063554585},{"key-phrase":"correlative study","score":0.0328787044},{"key-phrase":"scientific management","score":0.0268592611},{"key-phrase":"sufficient quality","score":0.0258880164},{"key-phrase":"great importance","score":0.019932799},{"key-phrase":"significant opportunity","score":0.0192328338}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":348,"Cited by":12.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Machine learning-assisted evaluation of land use policies and plans in a rapidly urbanizing district in Chongqing, China","Abstract":"Analysis of annual land use change is crucial to timely assessment of the impacts of land use policies, especially in rapidly urbanizing areas such as the Liangjiang New District of Chongqing, China. This research aims to assess the impacts of multi-level land use policies and plans and their effectiveness in protecting farmland, and to recommend policies to remedy defective ones. Markov Chain\u2013Cellular Automata modelling was integrated with machine learning to predict future urbanization. The results show that prior to the establishment of the District in late 2010, the urban area grew at 13% annually because local policies promoted profit-motivated development. This rate declined drastically to 4% during 2011\u20132012 in direct response to the changed local land use policies and strict enforcement of national policies. These policies stabilized the urbanization rate at 7% over the subsequent years. The safeguard of previous farmland was possible only when the national policies were aligned closely with the local policies in their aim, provided both were rigorously enforced through a land management agency. Urban land in 2020 is predicted to growth by at least 464 km2 with some differences between two scenarios. In the baseline scenario (no change in policies), almost 70% of new growth will take place inside three industry zones and the duty-free ports. However, in the national overall plan scenario, a significant amount of marginal farmland will be changed into greenfields within the planned urban zones. It is recommended that a hierarchical farmland protection policy be implemented. It should incorporate the national policies that must be adapted to the local settings to achieve sustainable urbanization and to minimize farmland loss. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural network; Land use change; Land use policies and plans; Markov Chain \u2013 Cellular Automata (MC-CA); Rapid urbanization; Spatiotemporal analysis","Authors":"Xu T., Gao J., Li Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2019.104030","x":8.78,"y":-3.14,"KeyPhrases":["multi-level land use","Markov Chain","Cellular Automata modelling","urbanization rate","Liangjiang New District"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"multi-level land use","score":0.6073186398},{"key-phrase":"land use policy","score":0.57870543},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical farmland protection","score":0.5729148388},{"key-phrase":"Urban land","score":0.5016462803},{"key-phrase":"annual land use","score":0.4859865606},{"key-phrase":"future urbanization","score":0.4757570624},{"key-phrase":"sustainable urbanization","score":0.4681286514},{"key-phrase":"changed local land use","score":0.4568994641},{"key-phrase":"farmland loss","score":0.4548204541},{"key-phrase":"previous farmland","score":0.4432899952},{"key-phrase":"Cellular Automata modelling","score":0.4150506854},{"key-phrase":"urbanization rate","score":0.4149944186},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4077668786},{"key-phrase":"urban zone","score":0.4063650966},{"key-phrase":"marginal farmland","score":0.4041261375},{"key-phrase":"farmland","score":0.3783375025},{"key-phrase":"land management agency","score":0.3510264456},{"key-phrase":"national overall plan scenario","score":0.3239838779},{"key-phrase":"Liangjiang New District","score":0.2841038704},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2456644624},{"key-phrase":"Markov Chain","score":0.2350111008},{"key-phrase":"new growth","score":0.2303010076},{"key-phrase":"industry zone","score":0.217802316},{"key-phrase":"local policy","score":0.2131493539},{"key-phrase":"national policy","score":0.1768892258},{"key-phrase":"baseline scenario","score":0.1149168089},{"key-phrase":"policy","score":0.1008284241},{"key-phrase":"subsequent year","score":0.0944097638},{"key-phrase":"significant amount","score":0.0428839289},{"key-phrase":"local setting","score":0.0247258544},{"key-phrase":"strict enforcement","score":0.0131965447},{"key-phrase":"defective one","score":0.0082416786},{"key-phrase":"timely assessment","score":0.0072548538},{"key-phrase":"direct response","score":0.0071260752},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":-0.014719341},{"key-phrase":"free port","score":-0.0519472957}]},{"Cluster":27,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":349,"Cited by":13.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Multivariate relationships between campus design parameters and energy performance using reinforcement learning and parametric modeling","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. The relationships between urban design parameters and multiple performance should be stipulated to evaluate scenarios for supporting timely and reliable design decisions. However, there are three major challenges: (1) only a few design alternatives are devised, (2) the multiple performance has not been provided synthetically, and (3) the relationships between design parameters and performance are difficult to be determined because they are multivariate relationships. This research proposes a new methodology applying a generative design approach using a reinforcement learning algorithm, a parametric performance modeling, and a multivariate adaptive regression splines approach to identify relationships between design parameters and urban performance. This research aims to support decision-making of urban design to achieve an energy efficient and visually qualified urban environment. A data-driven urban design approach is proposed to generate possible design alternatives using reinforcement learning, and a design-driven analysis is conducted to evaluate multiple performance of urban buildings using parametric modeling. The multivariate analysis presented relationships between urban geometric forms and performance criteria by using 30 samples. The findings show that to maintain optimal solar potential, the building coverage ratio is recommended to be bigger than 0.17. To maintain the optimal energy balance, the threshold for sky view factor is recommended as 54.17%.

We take full advantage of the benefits of new technology, but also clarify that city is not a machine, also cannot fully mechanically control the urban development. This study presents a methodology for identifying low-carbon travel block, which can be used to identify the built environment conducive to residents\u2019 low-carbon travel. We chose the four elements of traffic survey\u2014travel mode, travel time, travel purpose and travel frequency\u2014as the framework to evaluate travel carbon emissions. Using the index data collected from \u201cWeChat,\u201d a popular social-media platform in China and questionnaire surveys, we conducted hotspot analysis of the spatial distribution of travel carbon emissions in GIS. We obtained a comprehensive carbon emissions and its spatial distribution through the superposition of hotspot density surface of different indexes. The results show that E block within the research area has the lowest travel carbon emissions. These results suggest some planning implications from three aspects\u2014land use mode, road network and public service facilities: In the old urban district of Pucheng, the ratio of residential building area and other types\u2019 building area should be \u201c4:1\u20133:1\u201d; and we should develop the travel model of bicycle, and the interval of bicycle lanes should be 350\u2013450\u00a0m; The ratio of walking road to total road area should be 15\u201320%, and the width of road should be restricted. Coverage of transit site buffered for the radius of 150\u00a0m is 40\u201350%, coverage of shopping services buffered for the radius of 50\u00a0m is 45\u201360%, and coverage of recreational facilities buffered for the radius of 100\u00a0m is 50\u201370%. The results confirm that \u201cfunctional mixing\u201d and \u201cdense road network\u201d are beneficial to residents\u2019 low-carbon travel proposed by the predecessors. At the same time, we found that not the higher volume rate is, the more favorable for low-carbon travel. Small cities have limited number of population and scattered distribution of professional posts, which are not suitable for the traditional mode of improving the volume ratio and the bus system.

The estimation of urban pluvial flood vulnerability and prompt emergency responses are crucial steps towards urban planning and risk mitigation. However, uncertainties exist in the optimal allocation of emergency response centres (ERCs). This study assessed the current situation of ERCs in terms of PF-prone demand points. In this study, fire and police stations, hospitals and military camps were defined as ERCs, and residential buildings, where people spend most of their time, were considered demand points. Our study area was Damansara City in Peninsular Malaysia, which is frequently affected by PF. We combined an optimised PF probability model with ideal location allocation methods on a geographic information system platform to construct the proposed model for achieving accurate ERC spatial planning. Firstly, PF-prone urban areas were identified using a recent machine learning multiple layer perceptron (MLP) model. Then, a Taguchi method was used to calibrate the MLP variables, namely, seed, momentum, learning rate, hidden layer attribute and class. Fourteen important PF contributing parameters were weighted on the basis of historical flood events. The predicted PF-prone areas were validated by comparing the predictions with the data from meteorological stations and observed inventory events. In addition, the current locations of ERCs were utilised in the location allocation model to assess the ideal time for providing essential services to elements at risk. Minimum impedance and maximum coverage location problem models were implemented to assess the current allocated location of ERCs and multiple scenarios. The coverage of existing ERCs was calculated, and their suitable and optimal locations were projected for vulnerable inhabitants with either redundant or late emergency response. Results showed that areas near downtown have high PF probability but are not covered by ERCs within the standard 5 km radius. The proposed model can conserve time, reduce cost and save human lives by ensuring that vulnerable people in the Damansara River basin are covered by the nearest ERC. \u00a9 2019","Author Keywords":"Emergency response point; GIS; Maximum coverage location problem; Pluvial flooding","Authors":"Rizeei H.M., Pradhan B., Saharkhiz M.A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ijdrr.2019.101205","x":13.1999998093,"y":3.1800000668,"KeyPhrases":["urban pluvial flood vulnerability","location allocation model","multiple layer perceptron","emergency response centre","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban pluvial flood vulnerability","score":0.5990279913},{"key-phrase":"prone urban area","score":0.5200807452},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4500050247},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.423333317},{"key-phrase":"location allocation model","score":0.4216182232},{"key-phrase":"pluvial flooding","score":0.4081532359},{"key-phrase":"ideal location allocation","score":0.3750051856},{"key-phrase":"maximum coverage location","score":0.3734719455},{"key-phrase":"suitable and optimal location","score":0.3531467319},{"key-phrase":"emergency response centre","score":0.3472963274},{"key-phrase":"geographic information system","score":0.3449676037},{"key-phrase":"spatial planning","score":0.3315454423},{"key-phrase":"rainfall event","score":0.3172348142},{"key-phrase":"prompt emergency response","score":0.3148308396},{"key-phrase":"risk mitigation","score":0.3020163774},{"key-phrase":"multiple layer perceptron","score":0.2984147668},{"key-phrase":"late emergency response","score":0.2974917889},{"key-phrase":"water storage site","score":0.2887541652},{"key-phrase":"historical flood event","score":0.2803041339},{"key-phrase":"residential building","score":0.270500809},{"key-phrase":"Damansara River basin","score":0.2691261172},{"key-phrase":"Damansara City","score":0.2587453127},{"key-phrase":"MLP variable","score":0.2558923364},{"key-phrase":"problem model","score":0.2431937903},{"key-phrase":"optimised PF probability","score":0.2357766628},{"key-phrase":"meteorological station","score":0.2145084888},{"key-phrase":"optimal allocation","score":0.2088398337},{"key-phrase":"multiple scenario","score":0.2047241628},{"key-phrase":"additional pavement","score":0.2033180892},{"key-phrase":"current location","score":0.193976298},{"key-phrase":"Peninsular Malaysia","score":0.1937223971},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1921160519},{"key-phrase":"vulnerable inhabitant","score":0.1860878617},{"key-phrase":"prone demand point","score":0.1843151152},{"key-phrase":"accurate ERC","score":0.1736546159},{"key-phrase":"prone area","score":0.166927129},{"key-phrase":"demand point","score":0.1657294333},{"key-phrase":"high PF probability","score":0.1533084661},{"key-phrase":"global climate change","score":0.1439912021},{"key-phrase":"important PF","score":0.1424502134},{"key-phrase":"police station","score":0.1395845413},{"key-phrase":"km radius","score":0.1282370836},{"key-phrase":"ercs","score":0.1274656355},{"key-phrase":"population growth","score":0.12728706},{"key-phrase":"layer attribute","score":0.114257805},{"key-phrase":"essential service","score":0.1129580587},{"key-phrase":"military camp","score":0.1030934751},{"key-phrase":"vulnerable people","score":0.1021606848},{"key-phrase":"inventory event","score":0.0906532407},{"key-phrase":"PF","score":0.0879932791},{"key-phrase":"Taguchi method","score":0.0823517516},{"key-phrase":"ideal time","score":0.0756533891},{"key-phrase":"current situation","score":0.0591015331},{"key-phrase":"Minimum impedance","score":0.0312654711},{"key-phrase":"human life","score":0.01847234},{"key-phrase":"recent machine","score":-0.0044862316},{"key-phrase":"crucial step","score":-0.0246511772}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":352,"Cited by":8.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Investigation of the likelihood of green infrastructure (GI)enhancement along linear waterways or on derelict sites (DS)using machine learning","Abstract":"Studies evaluating the potential for green infrastructure (GI)development using traditional Boolean logic-based multi-criteria analysis methods are not capable of predicting future GI development in dynamic urbanscapes.

However in many developing countries or cities reliable local-scale socioeconomic data remain scarce. Here we show an easily accessible and timely updated location attribute-restaurant-can be used to accurately predict a range of socioeconomic attributes of urban neighborhoods. We merge restaurant data from an online platform with 3 microdatasets for 9 Chinese cities. Using features extracted from restaurants we train machine-learning models to estimate daytime and nighttime population number of firms and consumption level at various spatial resolutions. The trained model can explain 90 to 95% of the variation of those attributes across neighborhoods in the test dataset. We analyze the tradeoff between accuracy spatial resolution and number of training samples as well as the heterogeneity of the predicted results across different spatial locations demographics and firm industries. Finally we demonstrate the cross-city generality of this method by training the model in one city and then applying it directly to other cities. The transferability of this restaurant model can help bridge data gaps between cities allowing all cities to enjoy big data and algorithm dividends. \u00a9 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Unlike the LiDAR source-based approach that creates an approximated urban model, the adaptive spacing-based urban modeling algorithm generates an artificial urban environment that is visually different from a reference city, but has similar the characteristics to it. To demonstrate the two proposed urban modeling techniques, numerical simulations are conducted using open-source datasets to construct several realistic urban models. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Choi Y., Pate D., Briceno S., Mavris D.N.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICUAS.2019.8797943","x":5.4800000191,"y":1.8799999952,"KeyPhrases":["urban modeling algorithm","unmanned aircraft flight","airborne LiDAR source","cylinderical shape","numerical simulation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban modeling algorithm","score":0.6610308886},{"key-phrase":"artificial urban modeling technique","score":0.6579073668},{"key-phrase":"artificial urban environment","score":0.6467801332},{"key-phrase":"urban modeling technique","score":0.5934760571},{"key-phrase":"realistic urban model","score":0.5633677244},{"key-phrase":"Urban model","score":0.5098865032},{"key-phrase":"unmanned aircraft flight","score":0.5036189556},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4838863611},{"key-phrase":"UAV path","score":0.4639847279},{"key-phrase":"airborne LiDAR resource","score":0.4438823164},{"key-phrase":"lidar","score":0.443334043},{"key-phrase":"LiDAR information","score":0.4349521697},{"key-phrase":"planning algorithms","score":0.4102005363},{"key-phrase":"airborne LiDAR source","score":0.3859767616},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3356114626},{"key-phrase":"LiDAR source","score":0.3290621638},{"key-phrase":"numerical simulation","score":0.2585051954},{"key-phrase":"iterative algorithm","score":0.2215690315},{"key-phrase":"adaptive spacing method","score":0.2074895203},{"key-phrase":"modeling","score":0.2071730345},{"key-phrase":"reference city","score":0.2017423809},{"key-phrase":"adaptive spacing","score":0.1558557302},{"key-phrase":"open-source datasets","score":0.1335121095},{"key-phrase":"cylinderical shape","score":0.1233035773},{"key-phrase":"simple representation","score":0.0356369913}]},{"Cluster":5,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":358,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Fine-grained dynamic population mapping method based on large-scale sparse mobile phone data","Abstract":"The dynamic nature of urban population distribution plays a key role in urban planning, emergency management and public travel information services. Currently, the widespread use of mobile phone data provides the opportunity to support fine-scale population studies. However, the data sparsity problem of mobile phone data has been a huge handicap. To overcome this, we proposed a comprehensive approach to achieve fine-grained dynamic population distribution and high-resolution population map based on large-scale sparse mobile phone data. First, we developed an anchor-point-based trajectory reconstruction method to improve the spatiotemporal granularity of mobile phone trajectories. Then, a rapid and efficient automation population mapping method was proposed with the support of reconstructed high spatiotemporal resolution of human movements. Finally, we analyze spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution and spatial-Temporal interaction of human movement. Using a real mobile phone dataset in the city of Shanghai as a case study, we evaluated the performance of our method. Results indicated that our method improved the precision and reliability of population distribution estimation and could be utilized for quantitatively analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of population distribution and migration. We argue that this study is useful for understanding the highly dynamic human movement states and supporting advanced urban applications. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"dynamic population distribution; Machine learning; Mobile phone data; Trajectory reconstruction","Authors":"Li M., Zhang H., Chen J.","DOI":"10.1109\/MDM.2019.00008","x":5.41,"y":-2.95,"KeyPhrases":["urban population distribution","mobile phone trajectory","high spatiotemporal resolution","public travel information","mapping method"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban population distribution","score":0.5179110765},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution population","score":0.4965486825},{"key-phrase":"real mobile phone dataset","score":0.4881446958},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone trajectory","score":0.4828722477},{"key-phrase":"sparse mobile phone data","score":0.472300142},{"key-phrase":"fine-scale population","score":0.4609529376},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained dynamic population distribution","score":0.4472567439},{"key-phrase":"advanced urban application","score":0.4367782772},{"key-phrase":"trajectory reconstruction method","score":0.4086924791},{"key-phrase":"population distribution estimation","score":0.3905481696},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal granularity","score":0.3789455891},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3547045588},{"key-phrase":"population distribution","score":0.3497882485},{"key-phrase":"population","score":0.3451893628},{"key-phrase":"public travel information","score":0.3442159295},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone data","score":0.3401816785},{"key-phrase":"rapid and efficient automation population","score":0.3114940524},{"key-phrase":"dynamic human movement state","score":0.3041805625},{"key-phrase":"human movement","score":0.2853890657},{"key-phrase":"high spatiotemporal resolution","score":0.2756927907},{"key-phrase":"phone","score":0.2662517428},{"key-phrase":"mapping method","score":0.2491041422},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal characteristic","score":0.2214693278},{"key-phrase":"widespread use","score":0.1893237829},{"key-phrase":"spatial-Temporal interaction","score":0.188025713},{"key-phrase":"data sparsity problem","score":0.1805240065},{"key-phrase":"emergency management","score":0.1606096923},{"key-phrase":"dynamic nature","score":0.1593060046},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive approach","score":0.1110710353},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.0913405418},{"key-phrase":"key role","score":0.0239478499},{"key-phrase":"huge handicap","score":-0.0388101041}]},{"Cluster":3,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":359,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Attention based stack resnet for citywide traffic accident prediction","Abstract":"The fine-grained citywide traffic accident prediction is of great significance for urban traffic management.

One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander\u2019s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander\u2019s concept of \u201cwholeness\u201d through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities. \u00a9 2019 by the author.

Hydrologic modelling can support the planning of Sponge Cities at the catchment scale, however, highly detailed spatial data for model input can be challenging to compile from the various authorities, or, if available, may not be sufficiently detailed or updated. Remote sensing methods show great promise for mitigating this challenge due to their ability to efficiently classify satellite images into categories relevant to a specific application. In this study Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was applied to WorldView-3 satellite imagery (2017) to create a detailed land cover map of an urban catchment area in Beijing. While land cover classification results based on a Bayesian machine learning classifier alone provided an overall land cover classification accuracy of 63%, the subsequent inclusion of a series of refining rules in combination with supplementary data (including elevation and parcel delineations), yielded the significantly improved overall accuracy of 76%. Results of the land cover classification highlight the limitations of automated classification based on satellite imagery alone and the value of supplementary data and additional rules to refine classification results. Catchment scale hydrologic modelling based on the generated land cover results indicated that 61 to 82% of rainfall volume could be captured for a range of 24 h design storms under varying degrees of Sponge City implementation. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Geographic object based image analysis; Low impact development; Remote sensing; Sponge city; SWMM; Urban hydrology","Authors":"Randall M., Fensholt R., Zhang Y., Jensen M.B.","DOI":"10.3390\/w11061133","x":9.58,"y":-4.09,"KeyPhrases":["land cover classification","new stormwater infrastructure","China's Sponge City","satellite image","urban catchment area"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land cover classification","score":0.5360312462},{"key-phrase":"urban catchment area","score":0.4885161221},{"key-phrase":"Hydrologic modelling","score":0.4503307939},{"key-phrase":"detailed land cover","score":0.4410500526},{"key-phrase":"satellite imagery","score":0.4354659319},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.4314390421},{"key-phrase":"overall land cover","score":0.4085300267},{"key-phrase":"satellite image","score":0.3981568217},{"key-phrase":"Sponge City implementation","score":0.3848464489},{"key-phrase":"China's Sponge City","score":0.3833752871},{"key-phrase":"detailed spatial data","score":0.3812975287},{"key-phrase":"catchment scale","score":0.3666490912},{"key-phrase":"new stormwater infrastructure","score":0.3638651371},{"key-phrase":"Sponge Cities","score":0.3474116921},{"key-phrase":"rainfall volume","score":0.3359892964},{"key-phrase":"catchment","score":0.3199796677},{"key-phrase":"rain garden","score":0.3071962595},{"key-phrase":"study Geographic Object","score":0.307099998},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.3047154248},{"key-phrase":"green roofs","score":0.2831139565},{"key-phrase":"classification result","score":0.2793403268},{"key-phrase":"Bayesian machine learning","score":0.2644412518},{"key-phrase":"Image Analysis","score":0.2536386251},{"key-phrase":"parcel delineation","score":0.2072169781},{"key-phrase":"sponge","score":0.1771923304},{"key-phrase":"permeable pavement","score":0.1630622},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1482324898},{"key-phrase":"model input","score":0.137855202},{"key-phrase":"h design storm","score":0.1282127798},{"key-phrase":"widespread installation","score":0.1159268469},{"key-phrase":"specific application","score":0.0845258832},{"key-phrase":"various authority","score":0.0806307346},{"key-phrase":"refining rule","score":0.0668189526},{"key-phrase":"supplementary data","score":0.0612470396},{"key-phrase":"additional rule","score":0.0501872897},{"key-phrase":"great promise","score":-0.0068352772},{"key-phrase":"subsequent inclusion","score":-0.0167879984},{"key-phrase":"method show","score":-0.0398725607}]},{"Cluster":5,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":362,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Uncovering the relationship between point-of-interests-related human mobility and socioeconomic status","Abstract":"In a city or region, understanding the relationship between human mobility and socioeconomic status is critical to public policies formulation, urban design and marketing strategies development. Based on the available massive geo-located human data, existing studies focused almost exclusively on the position attributes (i.e. coordinates) of the locations visited by people to explore the relationship, however, they ignored the category attributes (e.g. restaurant or supermarket) of these locations which imply the purposes (e.g. eating or shopping) behind human movements. A location with coordinates and category information is usually referred to as a point-of-interest (POI). In this paper, we study the relationship between POIs-related human mobility and socioeconomic status at city level. Starting from the location-based social network (i.e. Foursquare) dataset, we find that the check-in numbers of location categories are correlated with socioeconomic indicators, either positively or negatively. To further validate these correlations, we develop and test a multi-task prediction framework based on POIs-related human mobility for forecasting socioeconomic indicators. Extensive experiments on the Foursquare dataset show that the socioeconomic indicators can be well predicted by our proposed framework.

A preeminent problem affecting urban planning is the appropriate choice of location to host a particular activity (either commercial or common welfare service) or the correct use of an existing building or empty space. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these challenges availed with machine learning techniques. The proposed system combines, fuses, and merges various types of data from different sources, encodes them using a novel semantic model that can capture and utilize both low-level geometric information and higher level semantic information and subsequently feeds them to the random forests classifier, as well as other supervised machine learning models for comparisons. Our experimental evaluation on multiple real-world data sets comparing the performance of several classifiers (including Feedforward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bag of Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Na\u00efve Bayes), indicated the superiority of Random Forests in terms of the examined performance metrics (Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall, F-measure and G-mean).","Author Keywords":"decision support system; machine learning; random forests; urban planning","Authors":"Sideris N., Bardis G., Voulodimos A., Miaoulis G., Ghazanfarpour D.","DOI":"10.3390\/s19102266","x":5.7399997711,"y":5.7899999619,"KeyPhrases":["urban data","random forests classifier","novel semantic model","Neural Networks","low-level geometric information"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban data","score":0.5191557407},{"key-phrase":"Random Forests","score":0.5186761022},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4894641042},{"key-phrase":"random forests classifier","score":0.4721130133},{"key-phrase":"Decision Trees","score":0.4475021064},{"key-phrase":"other supervised machine learning","score":0.393476814},{"key-phrase":"novel semantic model","score":0.3812669814},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machines","score":0.380931437},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.3696341217},{"key-phrase":"several classifier","score":0.3686320484},{"key-phrase":"semantic information","score":0.3658466339},{"key-phrase":"Na\u00efve Bayes","score":0.333068192},{"key-phrase":"real-world data","score":0.3078409433},{"key-phrase":"low-level geometric information","score":0.2955716848},{"key-phrase":"forests","score":0.2828065455},{"key-phrase":"Neural Networks","score":0.2785480022},{"key-phrase":"aforementioned data","score":0.1834388822},{"key-phrase":"consolidation","score":0.1309341937},{"key-phrase":"appropriate choice","score":0.1150419489},{"key-phrase":"empty space","score":0.1095104069},{"key-phrase":"maximal exploitation prospect","score":0.096245572},{"key-phrase":"correct use","score":0.0920743644},{"key-phrase":"particular activity","score":0.0858791694},{"key-phrase":"different source","score":0.0560868755},{"key-phrase":"preeminent problem","score":0.055249162},{"key-phrase":"various type","score":0.0499605909},{"key-phrase":"experimental evaluation","score":0.032090582},{"key-phrase":"common welfare service","score":0.0263182372}]},{"Cluster":25,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":366,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Learning task-specific city region partition","Abstract":"The proliferation of publicly accessible urban data provide new insights on various urban tasks. A frequently used approach is to treat each region as a data sample and build a model over all the regions to observe the correlations between urban features (e.g., demographics) and the target variable (e.g., crime count). To define regions, most existing studies use fixed grids or pre-defined administrative boundaries (e.g., census tracts or community areas). In reality, however, definitions of regions should be different depending on tasks (e.g., regional crime count prediction vs. real estate prices estimation). In this paper, we propose a new problem of task-specific city region partitioning, aiming to find the best partition in a city w.r.t. a given task. We prove this is an NP-hard search problem with no trivial solution. To learn the partition, we first study two variants of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We further propose a reinforcement learning scheme for effective sampling the search space. We conduct experiments on two real datasets in Chicago (i.e., crime count and real estate price) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. \u00a9 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.","Author Keywords":"Crime prediction; Region partition; Reinforcement learning","Authors":"Wang H., Jenkins P., Wei H., Wu F., Li Z.","DOI":"10.1145\/3308558.3313704","x":12.4200000763,"y":0.9700000286,"KeyPhrases":["accessible urban data","Markov Chain Monte","hard search problem","effective sampling","crime"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"accessible urban data","score":0.4762433767},{"key-phrase":"specific city region","score":0.4650425315},{"key-phrase":"various urban task","score":0.4626425505},{"key-phrase":"regional crime count","score":0.3913123608},{"key-phrase":"urban feature","score":0.3803441525},{"key-phrase":"effective sampling","score":0.3769385219},{"key-phrase":"real datasets","score":0.3228720725},{"key-phrase":"data sample","score":0.3007186055},{"key-phrase":"crime count","score":0.2778918743},{"key-phrase":"census tract","score":0.2770670056},{"key-phrase":"Markov Chain Monte","score":0.2760780454},{"key-phrase":"community area","score":0.246476233},{"key-phrase":"search space","score":0.2350999564},{"key-phrase":"pre-defined administrative boundary","score":0.2341688424},{"key-phrase":"crime","score":0.2261113524},{"key-phrase":"hard search problem","score":0.221423924},{"key-phrase":"target variable","score":0.2203191221},{"key-phrase":"real estate price","score":0.2200613618},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.147480607},{"key-phrase":"new problem","score":0.1040435433},{"key-phrase":"existing study","score":0.0999389589},{"key-phrase":"new insight","score":0.096301116},{"key-phrase":"count","score":0.02948796},{"key-phrase":"trivial solution","score":-0.0115328748}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":367,"Cited by":19.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A systematic measurement of street quality through multi-sourced Urban data: A human-oriented analysis","Abstract":"Many studies have been made on street quality, physical activity and public health. However, most studies so far have focused on only few features, such as street greenery or accessibility. These features fail to capture people\u2019s holistic perceptions. The potential of fine grained, multi-sourced urban data creates new research avenues for addressing multi-feature, intangible, human-oriented issues related to the built environment. This study proposes a systematic, multi-factor quantitative approach for measuring street quality with the support of multi-sourced urban data taking Yangpu District in Shanghai as case study. This holistic approach combines typical and new urban data in order to measure street quality with a human-oriented perspective. This composite measure of street quality is based on the well-established 5Ds dimensions: Density, Diversity, Design, Destination accessibility and Distance to transit. They are combined as a collection of new urban data and research techniques, including location-based service (LBS) positioning data, points of interest (PoIs), elements and visual quality of street-view images extraction with supervised machine learning, and accessibility metrics using network science. According to these quantitative measurements from the five aspects, streets were classified into eight feature clusters and three types reflecting the value of street quality using a hierarchical clustering method. The classification was tested with experts. The analytical framework developed through this study contributes to human-oriented urban planning practices to further encourage physical activity and public health. \u00a9 2019 by the author.

Identifying the location and living conditions of slums is a critical step toward designing effective urban policies. By combining household survey data and census data with high spatial resolution satellite imagery and other geospatial data using multiple methodologies, including machine learning, we attempt to define slums quantitatively within the city of Accra. Within these defined slum areas, the patterns of monetary poverty are assessed. Poverty rates are estimated at the neighborhood level and indicate that living in slums is strongly correlated with higher monetary poverty. Poverty is more prevalent in communities in areas of lower elevation, which in Accra are generally flood-prone areas. However, the results also suggest that not all people living in slums are living in monetary poverty. These results have important policy implications and are crucial to how economic opportunities are generated in slums so that effective urban policies can be designed. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"machine learning; poverty; remote sensing; slums","Authors":"Engstrom R., Pavelesku D., Tanaka T., Wambile A.","DOI":"10.1109\/JURSE.2019.8809052","x":8.55,"y":-3.81,"KeyPhrases":["slum area","machine learning","monetary poverty","census data","effective urban policy"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"slum area","score":0.5640577674},{"key-phrase":"slum","score":0.5198235512},{"key-phrase":"Sub-Saharan African city","score":0.4981904924},{"key-phrase":"Poverty rate","score":0.4798176885},{"key-phrase":"slum dweller","score":0.4555234909},{"key-phrase":"monetary poverty","score":0.452072382},{"key-phrase":"poverty","score":0.4403921962},{"key-phrase":"effective urban policy","score":0.4055675566},{"key-phrase":"census data","score":0.3913980126},{"key-phrase":"household survey data","score":0.3787602186},{"key-phrase":"other geospatial data","score":0.3615438342},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3261739612},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood level","score":0.3199274242},{"key-phrase":"economic opportunity","score":0.2909548283},{"key-phrase":"high spatial resolution satellite","score":0.2004078925},{"key-phrase":"natural disaster","score":0.1875969321},{"key-phrase":"urgent policy issue","score":0.1867913604},{"key-phrase":"multiple methodology","score":0.1646088362},{"key-phrase":"important policy implication","score":0.160342887},{"key-phrase":"critical step","score":0.0645484626},{"key-phrase":"prone area","score":0.0562395565}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":369,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Predicting safe parking spaces: A machine learning approach to geospatial urban and crime data","Abstract":"This research aims to identify spatial and time patterns of theft in Manhattan, NY, to reveal urban factors that contribute to thefts from motor vehicles and to build a prediction model for thefts.

A fuzzy logic-based traffic light control system and QOS parameters handling system is designed by extracting data available by routing schemes applied. Inorder to make the roads safer artificial intelligence-based security cameras hoping to achieve automated recognition of people and events is planned. Digital brains map the eyes to analyze live video and helping responders to more easily find crimes and accidents on roads. Machine learning is employed to get considerable gains in its ability to identify objects, the skill of analyzing scenes, activities, and movements.

However, few studies have discussed the impact of physical urban form features on the land surface temperature (LST) from a perspective of comprehensive urban spatial structures. This study used the ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and random forest regression (RF) to distinguish the relative contributions of urban form metrics on LST at three observation scales. Results of this study indicate that more than 90% of the LST variations were explained by selected urban form metrics using RF. Effects of the magnitude and direction of urban form metrics on LST varied with the changes of seasons and observation scales. Overall, building morphology and urban ecological infrastructure had dominant effects on LST variations in high-density urban centers. Urban green space and water bodies demonstrated stronger cooling effects, especially in summer. Building density (BD) exhibited significant positive effects on LST, whereas the floor area ratio (FAR) showed a negative influence on LST. The results can be applied to investigate and implement urban thermal environment mitigation planning for city managers and planners. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Land surface temperature; Ordinary least-squares regression; Random forest regression; Urban form","Authors":"Sun Y., Gao C., Li J., Wang R., Liu J.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11080924","x":4.8299999237,"y":2.4700000286,"KeyPhrases":["urban thermal environment mitigation","random forest regression","urban spatial structure","land surface temperature","LST variation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban thermal environment mitigation","score":0.6843440533},{"key-phrase":"urban thermal environment","score":0.6664984822},{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.5192041397},{"key-phrase":"physical urban form feature","score":0.4796846509},{"key-phrase":"urban spatial structure","score":0.4730292559},{"key-phrase":"urban ecological infrastructure","score":0.4499430358},{"key-phrase":"Urban green space","score":0.4278028309},{"key-phrase":"high-density urban area","score":0.393301636},{"key-phrase":"urban form","score":0.3762881756},{"key-phrase":"Building density","score":0.3533115387},{"key-phrase":"high-density urban center","score":0.3335820138},{"key-phrase":"random forest regression","score":0.3200574219},{"key-phrase":"extreme high temperature weather","score":0.3061619997},{"key-phrase":"floor area ratio","score":0.2917425334},{"key-phrase":"squares regression","score":0.2098793834},{"key-phrase":"city manager","score":0.2017418742},{"key-phrase":"LST variation","score":0.0883223414},{"key-phrase":"form","score":0.0758072138},{"key-phrase":"LST","score":0.0748417377},{"key-phrase":"dominant effect","score":0.0513434485},{"key-phrase":"significant positive effect","score":0.0490211584},{"key-phrase":"water body","score":0.0338796191},{"key-phrase":"key element","score":0.0329441354},{"key-phrase":"observation scale","score":0.0291254465},{"key-phrase":"negative influence","score":0.0167488959},{"key-phrase":"relative contribution","score":0.0154404454},{"key-phrase":"few study","score":-0.0237841196}]},{"Cluster":24,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":372,"Cited by":45.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Turning down the heat: An enhanced understanding of the relationship between urban vegetation and surface temperature at the city scale","Abstract":"Guiding urban planners on the cooling returns of different configurations of urban vegetation is important to protect urban dwellers from adverse heat impacts. To this end, we estimated statistical models that fused multi-temporal very fine spatial (20 cm) and vertical (1 mm) resolution imagery, that captures the complexity of urban vegetation, with remotely sensed temperature data to assess how urban vegetation configuration influences urban temperatures. Perth, Western Australia, was used as a case-study for this analysis. Panel regression models showed that within a location an increase in tree and shrub cover has a larger cooling effect than grass coverage. On average, holding all else equal, an approximate 1 km 2 increase in shrub (tree) cover within a location reduces surface temperatures by 12 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0C). We included a range of robustness checks for the observed relationships between urban vegetation type and temperature. Geographically weighted regression models showed spatial variation in the cooling effect of different vegetation types; this indicates that i) unobserved factors moderate temperature-vegetation relationships across urban landscapes, and ii) that urban vegetation type and temperature relationships are complex. Machine learning models (Random Forests) were used to further explore complex and non-linear relationships between different urban vegetation configurations and temperature. The Random Forests showed that vegetation type explained 31.84% of the out-of-bag variance in summer surface temperatures, that increased cover of large vegetation within a location increases cooling, and that different configurations of urban vegetation structure can lead to cooling gains. The models in this study were trained with vegetation data capturing local detail, multiple time-periods, and entire city coverage. Thus, these models illustrate the potential to develop locally-detailed and spatially explicit tools to guide planning of vegetation configuration to optimise cooling at local- and city-scales. \u00a9 2018","Author Keywords":"Geographically weighted regression (GWR); Land surface temperature (LST); Machine learning; Urban heat island (UHI); Urban vegetation","Authors":"Duncan J.M.A., Boruff B., Saunders A., Sun Q., Hurley J., Amati M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2018.11.223","x":-6.1300001144,"y":6.7899999619,"KeyPhrases":["urban vegetation configuration","temperature relationship","Random Forests","urban temperature","Panel regression model"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban vegetation configuration","score":0.614836514},{"key-phrase":"different urban vegetation configuration","score":0.6117116809},{"key-phrase":"urban vegetation structure","score":0.5931773186},{"key-phrase":"urban vegetation type","score":0.5754242539},{"key-phrase":"urban vegetation","score":0.5647945404},{"key-phrase":"urban temperature","score":0.5516411662},{"key-phrase":"urban landscape","score":0.4859077334},{"key-phrase":"vegetation data","score":0.4439761639},{"key-phrase":"vegetation relationship","score":0.4316518903},{"key-phrase":"Random Forests","score":0.3883983493},{"key-phrase":"vegetation configuration","score":0.3883009553},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3859811127},{"key-phrase":"different vegetation type","score":0.3637576699},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.3563785553},{"key-phrase":"vegetation type","score":0.3561624289},{"key-phrase":"vegetation","score":0.3543274999},{"key-phrase":"summer surface temperature","score":0.3521110713},{"key-phrase":"shrub cover","score":0.3508071303},{"key-phrase":"temperature data","score":0.3352295756},{"key-phrase":"large vegetation","score":0.3248728216},{"key-phrase":"temperature relationship","score":0.3007280827},{"key-phrase":"optimise cooling","score":0.2926632762},{"key-phrase":"Machine learning model","score":0.286664784},{"key-phrase":"spatial variation","score":0.2768918574},{"key-phrase":"urban dweller","score":0.2639748454},{"key-phrase":"statistical model","score":0.2559000254},{"key-phrase":"temperature","score":0.2503759563},{"key-phrase":"cooling effect","score":0.2465037405},{"key-phrase":"surface temperature","score":0.2433641553},{"key-phrase":"grass coverage","score":0.2336921096},{"key-phrase":"entire city coverage","score":0.2013023645},{"key-phrase":"adverse heat impact","score":0.2012979984},{"key-phrase":"weighted regression model","score":0.2002045214},{"key-phrase":"local-and city","score":0.1801471114},{"key-phrase":"moderate temperature","score":0.1571316123},{"key-phrase":"Panel regression model","score":0.1526013017},{"key-phrase":"complex and non-linear relationship","score":0.1368532628},{"key-phrase":"resolution imagery","score":0.1307655126},{"key-phrase":"local detail","score":0.1201214418},{"key-phrase":"Western Australia","score":0.1176772416},{"key-phrase":"bag variance","score":0.1159885526},{"key-phrase":"different configuration","score":0.0812220424},{"key-phrase":"multiple time","score":0.031475693},{"key-phrase":"explicit tool","score":0.0162699502},{"key-phrase":"robustness check","score":0.0118245436},{"key-phrase":"unobserved factor","score":-0.0038662031}]},{"Cluster":5,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":373,"Cited by":42.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Analyzing large-scale human mobility data: a survey of machine learning methods and applications","Abstract":"Human mobility patterns reflect many aspects of life, from the global spread of infectious diseases to urban planning and daily commute patterns. In recent years, the prevalence of positioning methods and technologies, such as the global positioning system, cellular radio tower geo-positioning, and WiFi positioning systems, has driven efforts to collect human mobility data and to mine patterns of interest within these data in order to promote the development of location-based services and applications. The efforts to mine significant patterns within large-scale, high-dimensional mobility data have solicited use of advanced analysis techniques, usually based on machine learning methods, and therefore, in this paper, we survey and assess different approaches and models that analyze and learn human mobility patterns using mainly machine learning methods. We categorize these approaches and models in a taxonomy based on their positioning characteristics, the scale of analysis, the properties of the modeling approach, and the class of applications they can serve. We find that these applications can be categorized into three classes: user modeling, place modeling, and trajectory modeling, each class with its characteristics. Finally, we analyze the short-term trends and future challenges of human mobility analysis. \u00a9 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Data mining; Human mobility patterns; Machine learning; Mobile phones","Authors":"Toch E., Lerner B., Ben-Zion E., Ben-Gal I.","DOI":"10.1007\/s10115-018-1186-x","x":5.54,"y":-2.85,"KeyPhrases":["human mobility data","machine learning method","positioning","urban planning","daily commute pattern"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"human mobility data","score":0.7661098242},{"key-phrase":"human mobility analysis","score":0.7402334213},{"key-phrase":"Human mobility pattern","score":0.6264463663},{"key-phrase":"place modeling","score":0.4334233701},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.4231960773},{"key-phrase":"WiFi positioning system","score":0.3964532316},{"key-phrase":"trajectory modeling","score":0.3820747137},{"key-phrase":"global positioning system","score":0.3727295995},{"key-phrase":"mobility","score":0.3651093543},{"key-phrase":"high-dimensional mobility","score":0.3566811085},{"key-phrase":"user modeling","score":0.3492489457},{"key-phrase":"daily commute pattern","score":0.3459977508},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.293210566},{"key-phrase":"positioning method","score":0.2867019773},{"key-phrase":"positioning","score":0.2672509551},{"key-phrase":"modeling approach","score":0.2264413238},{"key-phrase":"advanced analysis technique","score":0.2232246995},{"key-phrase":"significant pattern","score":0.2207192481},{"key-phrase":"future challenge","score":0.1842517853},{"key-phrase":"cellular radio tower","score":0.1573994756},{"key-phrase":"short-term trend","score":0.1493283361},{"key-phrase":"global spread","score":0.1371168494},{"key-phrase":"many aspect","score":0.1116387546},{"key-phrase":"infectious disease","score":0.0910406262},{"key-phrase":"different approach","score":0.0707208216},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.060279727}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":374,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Spatiotemporal detection of land use\/land cover change in the large basin using integrated approaches of remote sensing and GIS in the Upper Awash basin, Ethiopia","Abstract":"Assessment of the changing environmental conditions is essential for planning the wise use of natural resources. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the historical and future modeled LULC changes using multi-temporal Landsat images in the Upper Awash basin, Ethiopia. The supervised image classification method was used to determine the historical LULC changes based on Landsat 1 MSS 1972, Landsat 5 TM 1984, Landsat 7 ETM + 2000, and Landsat 8 OLI TIRS 2014. The future LULC change was predicted using the machine-learning approaches of Land Change Modeler (LCM). The LULC change detection analysis exhibited significant increment in the areal extent of the cropland and urban areas, and decreasing trends in the pasture, forests and shrubland coverage. Mainly, the LULC change matrices indicated that larger conversion rate was observed from shrubland to cropland area. The urban area found to increase by 606.2% from the year 1972 to 2014 and cropland has also increased by 47.3%. Whereas, a decreasing trend was obtained in the forest by \u2212\u00a025.1%, pasture \u2212 87.4%, shrubland \u2212 28.8% and water \u2212 21.0% in the same period. The modeled future LULC change scenarios of the year 2025 and 2035 have exhibited significant expansion of cropland and urban areas at the expense of forest, pasture and shrubland areas. The study has revealed the extent and the rate of LULC change at larger basin and subbasin level which can be useful for knowledge-based future land management practice in the Upper Awash basin. \u00a9 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Agricultural expansion; Classification accuracy; Land change modeler; Land cover change; Upper Awash basin; Urban sprawl","Authors":"Shawul A.A., Chakma S.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12665-019-8154-y","x":9.85,"y":-4.04,"KeyPhrases":["Land Change Modeler","LULC","supervised image classification","natural resource","cropland area"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Land Change Modeler","score":0.6285419464},{"key-phrase":"future land management","score":0.5011205077},{"key-phrase":"cropland area","score":0.4121907949},{"key-phrase":"multi-temporal Landsat image","score":0.4077610672},{"key-phrase":"shrubland area","score":0.386033237},{"key-phrase":"shrubland coverage","score":0.3334847987},{"key-phrase":"historical LULC change","score":0.3329004347},{"key-phrase":"LULC change detection","score":0.3287447393},{"key-phrase":"future LULC change","score":0.3272219896},{"key-phrase":"LULC change","score":0.3139259815},{"key-phrase":"supervised image classification","score":0.2918783128},{"key-phrase":"LULC change matrix","score":0.2836137414},{"key-phrase":"shrubland","score":0.2735662162},{"key-phrase":"areal extent","score":0.2631527185},{"key-phrase":"natural resource","score":0.262370348},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.2622878551},{"key-phrase":"Upper Awash basin","score":0.2463548779},{"key-phrase":"environmental condition","score":0.2228677869},{"key-phrase":"learning approach","score":0.1911983341},{"key-phrase":"significant increment","score":0.1701461822},{"key-phrase":"LULC","score":0.1594709456},{"key-phrase":"significant expansion","score":0.1531371772},{"key-phrase":"wise use","score":0.1150218025},{"key-phrase":"conversion rate","score":0.1061997116},{"key-phrase":"subbasin level","score":0.1036318168},{"key-phrase":"OLI TIRS","score":0.0450183824},{"key-phrase":"main objective","score":0.0210237224},{"key-phrase":"same period","score":-0.0031535104}]},{"Cluster":6,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":375,"Cited by":54.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Beyond Word2vec: An approach for urban functional region extraction and identification by combining Place2vec and POIs","Abstract":"The actual functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter, tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424). The research has important implications to urban planning and governance. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Geo-Text Mining; Machine Learning; Place2vec; POIs; Urban Functional Regions","Authors":"Zhai W., Bai X., Shi Y., Han Y., Peng Z.-R., Gu C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2018.11.008","x":5.78,"y":-3.57,"KeyPhrases":["urban functional region","other probabilistic topic model","geodemographic classification","simplified Place2vec model","POI"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban functional region","score":0.5248097777},{"key-phrase":"geodemographic classification","score":0.4559443891},{"key-phrase":"geographical space","score":0.4378873706},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4184776545},{"key-phrase":"simplified Place2vec model","score":0.4021579921},{"key-phrase":"text mining technique","score":0.3875387907},{"key-phrase":"other probabilistic topic model","score":0.3856807351},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood area","score":0.3811384439},{"key-phrase":"spatial context","score":0.3680111468},{"key-phrase":"functional region identification","score":0.3426926732},{"key-phrase":"means clustering model","score":0.3371112943},{"key-phrase":"functional region","score":0.2974270582},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.2879221141},{"key-phrase":"gram training framework","score":0.2817648947},{"key-phrase":"POI data","score":0.280641377},{"key-phrase":"original zoning scheme","score":0.2730592191},{"key-phrase":"functional zone","score":0.2611348033},{"key-phrase":"image recognition","score":0.2440208197},{"key-phrase":"POI vector","score":0.2413736135},{"key-phrase":"spatial interaction","score":0.2395643741},{"key-phrase":"similarity capturing performance","score":0.2383893728},{"key-phrase":"neighbor approach","score":0.2238935828},{"key-phrase":"training tuples","score":0.1812127084},{"key-phrase":"POI","score":0.1751717031},{"key-phrase":"POI tcenter","score":0.1714834124},{"key-phrase":"POI tcontext","score":0.1497521996},{"key-phrase":"open-access data","score":0.1406063288},{"key-phrase":"important implication","score":0.110611327},{"key-phrase":"high-dimensional characteristic vector","score":0.1061217785},{"key-phrase":"MRR","score":0.0822203234},{"key-phrase":"computational advancement","score":0.080142431},{"key-phrase":"actual function","score":0.069955796},{"key-phrase":"first law","score":0.064499028},{"key-phrase":"full use","score":0.0624060445},{"key-phrase":"numerous method","score":0.0602224134},{"key-phrase":"previous work","score":0.0579237267},{"key-phrase":"model limitation","score":0.0246161968},{"key-phrase":"NA level","score":0.0154781118},{"key-phrase":"reciprocal rank value","score":0.0135574657}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":376,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"City safety perception model based on visual content of street images","Abstract":"Safety perception measurement has been a subject of interest in many cities of the world.

Otherwise, the clients' losses will be of high value too. A database comprising hundreds of bidding procedures in the road construction industry in Poland has been developed. It includes the tender's participants, the locations of the roads sections, bids' values, the winners, and the types of roads. Every procedure has been evaluated and assigned to the set with a given level of collusion occurrence probability. The evaluation has required the analysis and the transformation of-described in the literature-collusive types of behaviours to the parameters of procedures that can be shown as numbers or ranks. Four criteria of a collusion threatened contracts have been chosen and applied for evaluation. Then, two methods of machine learning were applied. The first method was to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the procedures to the aforementioned sets. The other method was to utilize artificial neural networks predictive capabilities enriched by the fuzzy sets theory. The multiple output from ANN was defined as membership function values. The use of the fuzzy sets theory-the process of defuzzification-helps to classify the tender procedures to the sets of different level of risk (of collusion appearance). The results achieved in these two separate processes are compared and discussed. The created tool can be applied for the future tender procedures as a pre-test of a collusion appearance. \u00a9 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Anysz H., Foremny A., Kulejewski J.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/471\/11\/112064","x":4.8600001335,"y":3.1600000858,"KeyPhrases":["artificial neural network","collusion occurrence probability","road construction sector","future tender procedure","fuzzy set theory"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.4216933548},{"key-phrase":"collusion occurrence probability","score":0.399818629},{"key-phrase":"future tender procedure","score":0.3889484704},{"key-phrase":"fuzzy set theory","score":0.3842715621},{"key-phrase":"road construction sector","score":0.3525200486},{"key-phrase":"road construction industry","score":0.3317937851},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3210195601},{"key-phrase":"collusion","score":0.3058302104},{"key-phrase":"tender procedure","score":0.3027921319},{"key-phrase":"tender's participant","score":0.2688746452},{"key-phrase":"collusion appearance","score":0.2553696036},{"key-phrase":"predictive capability","score":0.2436708957},{"key-phrase":"tender participant","score":0.1924163401},{"key-phrase":"collusive type","score":0.1590583175},{"key-phrase":"road section","score":0.1557202637},{"key-phrase":"tender","score":0.1392886788},{"key-phrase":"multiple output","score":0.1290835291},{"key-phrase":"aforementioned set","score":0.1224912703},{"key-phrase":"high value","score":0.1059271917},{"key-phrase":"state budget","score":0.0978965238},{"key-phrase":"other method","score":0.0803020075},{"key-phrase":"first method","score":0.0725499317},{"key-phrase":"separate process","score":0.0640046224},{"key-phrase":"membership function value","score":0.0624889471},{"key-phrase":"non-concurrent behaviours","score":0.0470608547},{"key-phrase":"different level","score":-0.0200672001}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":378,"Cited by":21.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Multiscale road centerlines extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery","Abstract":"Accurate road extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery has many applications such as urban planning and vehicle navigation system. The common road extraction methods are based on classification algorithm, which needs to design robust handcrafted features for road. However, designing such features is difficult. For the road centerlines extraction problem, the existing algorithms have some limitations, such as spurs, time consuming. To address the above issues to some extent, we introduce the feature learning based on deep learning to extract robust features automatically, and present a method to extract road centerlines based on multiscale Gabor filters and multiple directional non-maximum suppression. The proposed algorithm consists of the following four steps. Firstly, the aerial imagery is classified by a pixel-wise classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, CNN is used to learn features from raw data automatically, especially the structural features. Then, edge-preserving filtering is conducted on the resulting classification map, with the original imagery serving as the guidance image. It is exploited to preserve the edges and the details of the road. After that, we do some post-processing based on shape features to extract more reliable roads. Finally, multiscale Gabor filters and multiple directional non-maximum suppression are integrated to get a complete and accurate road network.

Conventional approaches to control energy efficiency of buildings mainly focus on materials and capacity of insulation, but rarely consider urban and building geometries. By examining energy impacts on urban blocks by urban geometric forms, this paper seeks to identify urban geometric types and energy patterns on urban blocks. To achieve the aims of this study, this paper follows two steps: First, significant indicators for analyzing energy performance are identified in urban geometries; second, the types that capture urban geometry of a real city are categorized. As a result, as a reference for urban planning and design, the paper identifies 13 types that represent the characteristics of urban geometries regarding energy performance. The geometric indicators are carefully measured and their significance to energy performance of buildings is examined through regression analysis. According to these indicators, the 13 types are categorized using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, a machine learning method. Additionally, the 13 types are discussed for implementation as references in urban planning and design, particularly in block planning for a city. \u00a9 2018 International Energy Initiative","Author Keywords":"Cluster analysis; Energy; Typology; Urban block; Urban form; Urban geometry","Authors":"Oh M., Kim Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.esd.2018.12.002","x":5.0799999237,"y":3.9000000954,"KeyPhrases":["urban geometric form","energy performance","hierarchical clustering algorithm","regression analysis","block planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban geometric form","score":0.5728051066},{"key-phrase":"urban geometric type","score":0.5473065376},{"key-phrase":"urban geometry","score":0.516063869},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5084136724},{"key-phrase":"building geometry","score":0.4746845365},{"key-phrase":"energy efficiency","score":0.4238419533},{"key-phrase":"urban block","score":0.3801178336},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical clustering algorithm","score":0.3653999567},{"key-phrase":"energy performance","score":0.3509440422},{"key-phrase":"geometric","score":0.328269124},{"key-phrase":"major geometric characteristic","score":0.3225361407},{"key-phrase":"block planning","score":0.300907135},{"key-phrase":"geometric indicator","score":0.3006767929},{"key-phrase":"geometric parameter","score":0.2605146766},{"key-phrase":"energy pattern","score":0.2461597919},{"key-phrase":"energy","score":0.2186006457},{"key-phrase":"energy impact","score":0.2105750293},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.2069070041},{"key-phrase":"regression analysis","score":0.2034316957},{"key-phrase":"real city","score":0.154557839},{"key-phrase":"target area","score":0.1082776487},{"key-phrase":"significant indicator","score":0.0918273479},{"key-phrase":"Conventional approach","score":0.0763702169}]},{"Cluster":26,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":380,"Cited by":147.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban flood risk mapping using the GARP and QUEST models: A comparative study of machine learning techniques","Abstract":"Flood risk mapping and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Data-mining; FANP; Flood risk management; GIS; Urban planning","Authors":"Darabi H., Choubin B., Rahmati O., Torabi Haghighi A., Pradhan B., Kl\u00f8ve B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhydrol.2018.12.002","x":13.25,"y":3.1800000668,"KeyPhrases":["Flood risk mapping","machine learning model","urban density","Kappa statistic","Fuzzy Analytical Network"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Flood risk mapping","score":0.6804066896},{"key-phrase":"flood hazard determination","score":0.6692943573},{"key-phrase":"flood risk map","score":0.6529527903},{"key-phrase":"urban flood risk","score":0.6185777187},{"key-phrase":"flood vulnerability map","score":0.6056810617},{"key-phrase":"flood hazard","score":0.5344281197},{"key-phrase":"urban flood damage","score":0.5160656571},{"key-phrase":"flood vulnerability","score":0.4857513011},{"key-phrase":"Fuzzy Analytical Network","score":0.4311199188},{"key-phrase":"flood conditioning factor","score":0.4194173217},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.3921591043},{"key-phrase":"flood","score":0.3738553524},{"key-phrase":"hydrological and hydraulic data","score":0.338488698},{"key-phrase":"hydraulic and hydrological data","score":0.3374606371},{"key-phrase":"Genetic Algorithm Rule","score":0.320769906},{"key-phrase":"urban density","score":0.2600736916},{"key-phrase":"Efficient Statistical Tree","score":0.2417919934},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.212436974},{"key-phrase":"GARP model","score":0.1879998446},{"key-phrase":"Kappa statistic","score":0.1871988773},{"key-phrase":"population density","score":0.1624846607},{"key-phrase":"Sari city","score":0.1608611941},{"key-phrase":"characteristic curve","score":0.1606630087},{"key-phrase":"conditioning factor","score":0.1332182139},{"key-phrase":"Different conditioning factor","score":0.1276760846},{"key-phrase":"expert knowledge","score":0.1243648827},{"key-phrase":"performance accuracy","score":0.1170353442},{"key-phrase":"model performance","score":0.1056136563},{"key-phrase":"field survey","score":0.0999704599},{"key-phrase":"important factor","score":0.0959399194},{"key-phrase":"economic condition","score":0.083647579},{"key-phrase":"art machine learning","score":0.076110594},{"key-phrase":"curve number","score":0.0753212795},{"key-phrase":"available report","score":0.0672130734},{"key-phrase":"QUEST model","score":0.0175125748},{"key-phrase":"conditioning","score":0.015343802},{"key-phrase":"major role","score":-0.0055844663}]},{"Cluster":30,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":381,"Cited by":28.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Machine learning approaches to understand the influence of urban environments on human's physiological response","Abstract":"This research proposes a framework for signal processing and information fusion of spatial-temporal multi-sensor data pertaining to understanding patterns of humans physiological changes in an urban environment.

Particularly, predicting pedestrian crossings at crosswalks is of considerable importance for avoiding accidents on the one hand and not unnecessarily slowing down traffic on the other hand. Traditional model-based motion tracking and prediction approaches have difficulties in capturing abrupt changes in motions, as humans can perform them. In this paper, an approach for predicting pedestrian motions that combines established motion tracking algorithms with data-driven methods is presented. The approach is built upon a hierarchical structure, where first, the intent of each pedestrian is classified. Then, the approach computes several qualitative metrics, such as time-to-cross, for the pedestrians classified as crossing. The approach is evaluated on a challenging urban data set collected for different types of crosswalks such as roundabouts and straight roads. The evaluation also provides a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed approach. \u00a9 2000-2011 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Autonomous vehicles; decision making; machine learning; prediction methods","Authors":"Volz B., Mielenz H., Gilitschenski I., Siegwart R., Nieto J.","DOI":"10.1109\/TITS.2018.2827956","x":5.13,"y":-2.09,"KeyPhrases":["pedestrian motion","Robust prediction","autonomous driving","roundabout and straight road","hierarchical structure"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"pedestrian motion","score":0.6032659411},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian behavior","score":0.5461716652},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian crossing","score":0.4772256017},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian","score":0.394385457},{"key-phrase":"autonomous driving","score":0.3820010424},{"key-phrase":"prediction approach","score":0.3510833979},{"key-phrase":"Robust prediction","score":0.3410833478},{"key-phrase":"motion tracking algorithm","score":0.3218939602},{"key-phrase":"motion tracking","score":0.3166380823},{"key-phrase":"motion","score":0.2867878079},{"key-phrase":"roundabout and straight road","score":0.2812978625},{"key-phrase":"challenging urban data","score":0.2340190858},{"key-phrase":"generalization performance","score":0.2160538882},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical structure","score":0.133078739},{"key-phrase":"Traditional model","score":0.0933645889},{"key-phrase":"thorough analysis","score":0.0654428601},{"key-phrase":"challenging problem","score":0.0312875137},{"key-phrase":"different type","score":0.0312505886},{"key-phrase":"abrupt change","score":0.0095042884},{"key-phrase":"other hand","score":0.0073599927},{"key-phrase":"considerable importance","score":-0.064159736}]},{"Cluster":20,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":383,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Comparison of approaches for urban functional zones classification based on multi-source geospatial data: A case study in Yuzhong District, Chongqing, China","Abstract":"Accurate and timely classification and monitoring of urban functional zones prove to be significant in rapidly developing cities, to better understand the real and varying urban functions of cities to support urban planning and management.

The complexity of this category of classification poses tremendous challenges to these studies especially in terms of classification accuracy, but on the opposite, the rapid development of machine learning technologies provides us with new opportunities. In this study, a set of commonly used urban functional zones classification approaches, including Multinomial Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, are examined and compared with the newly developed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, using the case study of Yuzhong District, Chongqing, China.

The results suggest that the XGBoost classification model performed the best and was able to achieve an accuracy of 88.05%, which is significantly higher than the other commonly used approaches.

Consumers of self-driving cars and vehicles have different concerns, for example, safety and security, to name a few. Also, the public sector has interests in self-driving cars such as amending policies to enable the management of self-driving vehicles in cities, urban planning, traffic management and, etc. In this paper, more than 2700 corpus are extracted from literature from several subject areas to identify latent (hidden) topics of self-driving cars. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used for topic identification. The result of this study shows that topics identified are valid research areas such as urban planning, driver car (computer) interaction, self-driving control and system design, ethics in self-driving cars, safety and risk assessment, training dataset quality and machine learning in self-driving cars are among the topics identified. Furthermore, the network visualization of association graph of terms shows that the most frequently discussed concepts reveal that control of self-driving cars is based on algorithms, data, design, method, and model. The methods used in this study and the results can be used as decision tools, if carefully applied, in diverse disciplines that are disrupted by the introduction of self-driving cars.

It is therefore important to take advantage of available infrastructures to maximize the information extraction for each technology. Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services. Furthermore, the resulting annotations pave the way for building a historical vehicle counting dataset to be used for analysing the impact of road traffic on many city-related issues such as urban planning, security, and pollution. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Monitoring; Object detection; Regression; Smart cities; Time series; Traffic; Transport","Authors":"Rajotte J.-F., Sotir M., Noiseux C., Noel L.-P., Bertiere T.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2018.00194","x":3.9400000572,"y":2.7799999714,"KeyPhrases":["low-quality urban road traffic","pre-trained object detection","neural network annotation","traffic monitoring device","many city"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"low-quality urban road traffic","score":0.546130538},{"key-phrase":"non-intrusive traffic monitoring","score":0.5460938215},{"key-phrase":"traffic monitoring device","score":0.5382502079},{"key-phrase":"pre-trained object detection","score":0.4978213608},{"key-phrase":"road traffic","score":0.4947500825},{"key-phrase":"traffic condition","score":0.4704628587},{"key-phrase":"traffic","score":0.4560560584},{"key-phrase":"human annotation","score":0.3752999008},{"key-phrase":"neural network annotation","score":0.3625054955},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.334163934},{"key-phrase":"annotation","score":0.2737091184},{"key-phrase":"many city","score":0.2684350908},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2544880509},{"key-phrase":"historical vehicle","score":0.2332472801},{"key-phrase":"available infrastructure","score":0.2009607852},{"key-phrase":"information extraction","score":0.1984722018},{"key-phrase":"related service","score":0.1397648752},{"key-phrase":"financial and human resource point","score":0.0160847623}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":386,"Cited by":24.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"A reduced order model for turbulent flows in the urban environment using machine learning","Abstract":"To help create a comfortable and healthy indoor and outdoor environment in which to live, there is a need to understand turbulent air flows within the urban environment. To this end, building on a previously reported method [1], we develop a fast-running Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Model (NIROM) for predicting the turbulent air flows found within an urban environment. To resolve larger scale turbulent fluctuations, we employ a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model and solve the resulting computational model on unstructured meshes. The objective is to construct a rapid-running NIROM from these results that will have \u2018similar\u2019 dynamics to the original LES model. Based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and machine learning techniques, this Reduced Order Model (ROM) is six orders of magnitude faster than the high-fidelity LES model and we demonstrate how \u2018similar\u2019 it can be to the high-fidelity model by comparing statistical quantities such as the mean flows, Reynolds stresses and probability densities of the velocities. We also include validation of the high-fidelity model against data from wind tunnel experiments. This paper represents a key step towards the use of reduced order modelling for operational purposes with the tantalising possibility of it being used in place of Gaussian plume models, and the potential for greatly improved model fidelity and confidence. \u00a9 2018","Author Keywords":"Gaussian process regression; Machine learning; Non-intrusive reduced order modelling; Operational modelling; Proper orthogonal decomposition; Urban flows","Authors":"Xiao D., Heaney C.E., Mottet L., Fang F., Lin W., Navon I.M., Guo Y., Matar O.K., Robins A.G., Pain C.C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.buildenv.2018.10.035","x":5.5500001907,"y":2.3499999046,"KeyPhrases":["Large Eddy Simulation","urban environment","Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","order modelling","unstructured mesh"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Large Eddy Simulation","score":0.4831693769},{"key-phrase":"turbulent air","score":0.4516400099},{"key-phrase":"Gaussian plume model","score":0.4367690682},{"key-phrase":"turbulent fluctuation","score":0.4286527336},{"key-phrase":"high-fidelity model","score":0.3590952754},{"key-phrase":"computational model","score":0.303653121},{"key-phrase":"Reynolds stress","score":0.3030714691},{"key-phrase":"wind tunnel experiment","score":0.2819698751},{"key-phrase":"order modelling","score":0.2754095197},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.2747325301},{"key-phrase":"mean flows","score":0.2578849196},{"key-phrase":"Order Model","score":0.2433232516},{"key-phrase":"unstructured mesh","score":0.2415927052},{"key-phrase":"model fidelity","score":0.2013930082},{"key-phrase":"Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","score":0.1977936327},{"key-phrase":"flows","score":0.1946737468},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.1834791601},{"key-phrase":"indoor and outdoor environment","score":0.1719743609},{"key-phrase":"high-fidelity LES","score":0.1703915447},{"key-phrase":"original LES model","score":0.14631024},{"key-phrase":"rapid-running_VBG NIROM","score":0.0746088102},{"key-phrase":"probability density","score":0.0417092703},{"key-phrase":"statistical quantity","score":0.0115620084},{"key-phrase":"operational purpose","score":0.0031013293},{"key-phrase":"fidelity","score":-0.0111308899},{"key-phrase":"tantalising possibility","score":-0.0416379273},{"key-phrase":"key step","score":-0.0426943153}]},{"Cluster":4,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":387,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"Internet of things and statistical analysis","Abstract":"Internet of Things (IoT) creates a world where physical objects are integrated into information networks. IoT refers to the connection of devices that transforms a wide range of fields. In medicine, for instance, connected devices can assist medical professionals in monitoring patients inside and outside of hospitals. Practitioners adjust treatments and improve patient outcomes using the produced data. Another field in which a transformation occurs is urban planning. Sensors with an IP address are placed under a busy street, so drivers can be alerted about upcoming delays or accidents. The explosive growth in the number of devices connected to the IoT and the exponential increase in data consumption only reflect how the growth of large data sets is perfectly overlapping with that of IoT. In addition to increased volume, the IoT-generated large data sets exhibit a mixture of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of these data sets is the key to developing smart IoT applications. Since IoT will be among the greatest sources of new data, data science is used to make IoT applications more intelligent. Analysis of these data sets, in practice, is done using various data science techniques. Data science is the compounding of different disciplines of sciences that uses data mining, machine learning, and other techniques to get forms and fresh insights from data. The different algorithms are applied to the information in order to draw out higher-level information from IoT data sets. These techniques include a wide scope of algorithms applied in different domains and comprise both unsupervised and supervised methods. The procedure of applying data analytic methods to particular areas involves data models such as neural networks, classification, clustering methods, and applying efficient algorithms that fit with the data characteristics. In this article, we focus on statistical analysis of the collected data sets and look at the similarities and differences of data mining and statistical methods for IoT systems. By explaining the need for both descriptive and inferential statistical methods, we show the inadequacy of using only unsupervised data mining techniques for IoT data sets. We then concentrate on statistical inference approaches, such as the design-based and model-based inferences, and discuss the role of explanatory versus forecasting statistical models in an IoT environment. Lastly, we demonstrate the danger of making forecasts using only unsupervised techniques by revealing open challenges as future research directions. \u00a9 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Author Keywords":"Data mining; Descriptive-, explanatory statistical analysis; Design-based-, model-based-inferences; Explanatory-, forecasting models; Unsupervised-, supervised learning","Authors":"Ta\u015f\u0131ran A.C.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-93557-7_8","x":6.62,"y":-2.0,"KeyPhrases":["smart IoT application","unsupervised data mining","new data","different algorithm","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"smart IoT application","score":0.5618216991},{"key-phrase":"IoT application","score":0.5457695723},{"key-phrase":"IoT data set","score":0.5168534517},{"key-phrase":"iot","score":0.5100862384},{"key-phrase":"IoT system","score":0.5023860931},{"key-phrase":"data mining","score":0.4895511866},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised data mining","score":0.4879408479},{"key-phrase":"various data science","score":0.4726882577},{"key-phrase":"IoT environment","score":0.4585040808},{"key-phrase":"data science","score":0.4253425598},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.4143115878},{"key-phrase":"large data set","score":0.4097653329},{"key-phrase":"data set","score":0.4004609585},{"key-phrase":"large data","score":0.3873886764},{"key-phrase":"data model","score":0.3810642362},{"key-phrase":"clustering method","score":0.3723891675},{"key-phrase":"Intelligent processing","score":0.3683900237},{"key-phrase":"new data","score":0.356363833},{"key-phrase":"statistical analysis","score":0.3385952115},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.321733892},{"key-phrase":"data quality","score":0.3181298971},{"key-phrase":"statistical inference approach","score":0.3078531027},{"key-phrase":"efficient algorithms","score":0.3001378179},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised and supervised method","score":0.2950133085},{"key-phrase":"data consumption","score":0.2906318009},{"key-phrase":"statistical model","score":0.2822185457},{"key-phrase":"inferential statistical method","score":0.2753156126},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised technique","score":0.2693889141},{"key-phrase":"statistical method","score":0.2638424039},{"key-phrase":"different algorithm","score":0.2587582171},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2547075152},{"key-phrase":"connected device","score":0.2343829274},{"key-phrase":"information network","score":0.216223985},{"key-phrase":"future research direction","score":0.2142181545},{"key-phrase":"IP address","score":0.2133266628},{"key-phrase":"busy street","score":0.2065791935},{"key-phrase":"level information","score":0.1942929924},{"key-phrase":"exponential increase","score":0.1759297997},{"key-phrase":"wide scope","score":0.1456144452},{"key-phrase":"different discipline","score":0.1305309236},{"key-phrase":"particular area","score":0.1241186932},{"key-phrase":"explosive growth","score":0.1056978703},{"key-phrase":"analytic method","score":0.1049911529},{"key-phrase":"physical object","score":0.1033385321},{"key-phrase":"set","score":0.0978363007},{"key-phrase":"fresh insight","score":0.0896137655},{"key-phrase":"different domain","score":0.0838867798},{"key-phrase":"wide range","score":0.0812920406},{"key-phrase":"patient outcome","score":0.0800342932},{"key-phrase":"upcoming delay","score":0.0794156343},{"key-phrase":"multiple modality","score":0.0682013333},{"key-phrase":"other technique","score":0.0606006049},{"key-phrase":"open challenge","score":0.0053427145}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":388,"Cited by":12.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Multi-GCN: Graph convolutional networks for multi-view networks, with applications to global poverty","Abstract":"With the rapid expansion of mobile phone networks in developing countries, large-scale graph machine learning has gained sudden relevance in the study of global poverty.

Yet the vast majority of computational tools and algorithms used in these applications do not account for the multi-view nature of social networks: people are related in myriad ways, but most graph learning models treat relations as binary. In this paper, we develop a graph-based convolutional network for learning on multi-view networks. We show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms on three different prediction tasks using mobile phone datasets from three different developing countries.

Semantic segmentation could enable automatic, efficient, and large-scale understanding of overhead imageries for these applications. However, semantic segmentation of overhead imageries is a challenging task, primarily due to the large domain gap from existing research in ground imageries, unavailability of large-scale dataset with pixel-level annotations, and inherent complexity in the task. Readily available vast amount of unlabeled overhead imageries share more common structures and patterns compared to the ground imageries, therefore, its large-scale analysis could benefit from unsupervised feature learning techniques. In this work, we study various self-supervised feature learning techniques for semantic segmentation of overhead imageries. We choose image semantic inpainting as a self-supervised task [36] for our experiments due to its proximity to the semantic segmentation task. We (i) show that existing approaches are inefficient for semantic segmentation, (ii) propose architectural changes towards self-supervised learning for semantic segmentation, (iii) propose an adversarial training scheme for self-supervised learning by increasing the pretext task's difficulty gradually and show that it leads to learning better features, and (iv) propose a unified approach for overhead scene parsing, road network extraction, and land cover estimation.

In this research we take a complete different approach by looking at urban structure through the use of deep convolutional variational autoencoders with interesting results. Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique in which we employ neural networks for the task of representation learning. Specifically, a neural network architecture imposes a bottleneck in the network which forces a compressed and generalization of the knowledge representation of the structure of space. This non-linear compression and subsequent reconstruction creates a unique set of features that are inherent of urban space. Our network is multiple layers deep in order to be able to encode basic spatial complexity and is build based on a convolutional network architecture which is inspired by biological processes similar to the connectivity pattern between neurons that resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. Artificial neurons respond to real urban networks of London in a restricted region of the visual field, which partially overlap such that they cover the entire convolutional visual field. Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. Each convolutional neuron processes data only for its receptive field but the cascading nature of our network build a knowledge of more complex spatial relations as data move deeper. While convolutional neural networks are extensively used in supervised image classification the work presented in this papers is completely unsupervised. In this paper we present the complete architecture of the deep convolutional network that was trained for months using data from the city of London, concluding with two significant outcomes extracted from the variational encoding and decoding processes. A non-linear clustering, or neural aggregation, of urban space based on the learned features and a generative urban network output based on the variational synthesis we call machine intuition. \u00a9 2019 Beijing JiaoTong University.

We select Yangon as the study area because the government faces many problems in urban planning sectors due to the population growth and urban sprawl. Therefore, the proposed method aims to perform the land cover classification in Yangon using Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and post-classification change detection between 1987 and 2017 with 5 years interval periods are evaluated. Despite land cover classifications using satellite imagery have been executed in the past decades, the classification of remotely sensed data integrating with multiple spectral, temporal and textural features and processing time for classification using time series data still have limitations. To overcome these limitations, features extracted from Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Landsat-7, Landsat-5 and Open Street Map (OSM) are executed for classification and cloud-based GEE platform is used to reduce the processing time. Some spectral indexes such as NDVI, NDBI and slope from SRTM are calculated to achieve better classification. Land cover classification is performed by using the RF classifier with the different bands' combination. Land cover classification map with 7 classes (Shrub Land, Bare Land, Forest, Vegetation, Urban Area, Lake and River) is obtained with the overall accuracy of 96.73% and kappa statistic of 0.95 for 2017.

The transportation mode information can help to improve urban planning, traffic management and journey planning. Though much work has been done on the transportation mode recognition using classic machine learning algorithms, the performance of these methods is not reasonable and heavily relies on the effectiveness of handcrafted features. In this paper, we leverage the strong representation ability of deep learning method and present a deep-learning-based algorithm for transportation mode recognition, namely CL-TRANSMODE, which is capable of accurately detecting multiple transportation modes. The algorithm first uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn appropriate and robust feature representations for transportation modes recognition. Then, an LSTM network performs a further learning of the temporal dependencies characteristics on the feature vectors of CNN output. To further enhance the accuracy of transportation mode recognition, several artificial segments and peak features are extracted from the raw sensor measurements. These features characterize the transportation modes over a much long period of time (minutes or hours). By combining the CNN-extracted features and handcrafted features, our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm can accurately differentiate eight transportation modes, i.e., walking, running, bicycling, driving a car, riding a bus, taking a metro, taking a train, or being stationary. Extensive experiments on both the SHL and HTC datasets demonstrate that use our proposed CL-TRANSMODE transportation mode recognition algorithm which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative algorithms. On the SHL dataset, which contain barometric data, the accuracy using the CL-TRANSMODE algorithm can reaches 98.1%. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"CNN; context-aware; LSTM; Mobile sensing; transportation mode recognition","Authors":"Qin Y., Luo H., Zhao F., Wang C., Wang J., Zhang Y.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2944686","x":5.66,"y":-1.74,"KeyPhrases":["transportation mode recognition","LSTM network","barometric data","rich smartphones","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"transportation mode recognition","score":0.6084741354},{"key-phrase":"transportation mode information","score":0.4420332611},{"key-phrase":"deep learning method","score":0.4379177094},{"key-phrase":"transportation modes","score":0.3976868093},{"key-phrase":"transportation mode","score":0.3972679079},{"key-phrase":"LSTM network","score":0.3905904889},{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.3827493191},{"key-phrase":"multiple transportation mode","score":0.3304397464},{"key-phrase":"TRANSMODE transportation mode","score":0.3090421557},{"key-phrase":"feature vector","score":0.2850589752},{"key-phrase":"journey planning","score":0.2758808732},{"key-phrase":"recognition algorithm","score":0.2699254453},{"key-phrase":"appropriate and robust feature representation","score":0.2645917833},{"key-phrase":"HTC datasets","score":0.2559580207},{"key-phrase":"barometric data","score":0.2524951696},{"key-phrase":"traffic management","score":0.2509759068},{"key-phrase":"rich smartphones","score":0.2451882362},{"key-phrase":"peak feature","score":0.2229761481},{"key-phrase":"CNN output","score":0.222007066},{"key-phrase":"SHL dataset","score":0.1975460798},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.1863310337},{"key-phrase":"raw sensor measurement","score":0.1842269897},{"key-phrase":"strong representation ability","score":0.1788496971},{"key-phrase":"mobile Internet technique","score":0.1693249345},{"key-phrase":"mode","score":0.1640412211},{"key-phrase":"temporal dependency characteristic","score":0.1584875882},{"key-phrase":"TRANSMODE algorithm","score":0.1571546048},{"key-phrase":"several artificial segment","score":0.1520283818},{"key-phrase":"much long period","score":0.1233450621},{"key-phrase":"classic machine","score":0.1200832054},{"key-phrase":"CL","score":0.1176985353},{"key-phrase":"much attention","score":0.1062902808},{"key-phrase":"further learning","score":0.0772670209},{"key-phrase":"much work","score":0.0739210993},{"key-phrase":"rapid development","score":0.063790597},{"key-phrase":"various contexts","score":0.061673142},{"key-phrase":"comparative algorithms","score":0.0402693264},{"key-phrase":"Extensive experiment","score":0.0189648028}]},{"Cluster":13,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":393,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Multi-scale correlation-based feature selection and random forest classification for LULC mapping from the integration of SAR and optical Sentinel images","Abstract":"Reliable and accurate land use\/land cover (LULC) map is a crucial data source for the understanding of coupled human-environment systems, monitoring changes, timely low-cost planning, and management of natural resources. Improvements in sensor technologies and machine learning capabilities have shifted the attention of remote sensing community to data complementarity through fusion of multi-sensor data for accurate feature extraction and mapping. Amalgamation of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has shown promising advantages in enhancing the accuracy of extracting LULC as such method allows exploitation of information in sensors. This study investigated the potential of using freely available multisource Sentinel images to extract LULC maps in semi-arid environments through multi-scale geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). A multi-scale classification framework that integrates GEOBIA, correlation-based feature selection (CFS), and random forest (RF)-supervised classification was adopted to extract LULC from assimilation of Sentinel multi-sensor products. First, Sentinel-1 and-2 images were pre-processed. Second, optimum multi-scale segmentation levels were selected using F-score segmentation quality measures. Third, 70 features of various spectral indices and derivatives and geometrical features from optical data and multiple ratios and textural features from dual-polarization SAR images were computed, and a CFS based on wrapper approach was used to select the most significant features at multi-scale levels. Finally, a single and multi-scale RF classifier was used to extract LULC classes using the most relevant features extracted from Sentinel SAR and optical images. Results of multi-scale image segmentation optimization showed that scale parameter (SP) values of 40, 60, and 150 were optimal for extraction of LULC classes. Results of feature selection showed that 22, 24, and 27 features were selected at scale SP values of 40, 60, and 150, respectively. Half of the features were common among the three scales. Single RF classification yielded overall accuracy (OA) values of 92.10%, 93%, and 91% and kappa coefficients of 0.901, 0.912, and 0.89 at scale values of 150, 60, and 40, respectively. Multiscale RF classification from scale values of 150 and 60 produced better LULC classification with OA 96.06% and kappa coefficient of 0.95 compared with other scale SP values. The integrated approach demonstrated an effective and promising method for high-quality LULC extraction from coupling optical and SAR images. Overall, multi-sensor Sentinel images along with the adopted approach feature a remarkable potential for improving LULC extraction and can effectively be used to update geographic information system layers for various applications. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.","Author Keywords":"data fusion; image segmentation optimization; LULC; object-based classification; Optical sensors; SAR","Authors":"Al-Ruzouq R., Shanableh A., Gibril M.B., Kalantar B.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2533123","x":9.81,"y":-4.5,"KeyPhrases":["SAR image","multi-scale classification framework","accurate land use","LULC extraction","semi-arid environment"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"SAR image","score":0.4823515415},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.457667917},{"key-phrase":"multi-scale classification framework","score":0.4291701615},{"key-phrase":"multi-sensor Sentinel image","score":0.4256642461},{"key-phrase":"Sentinel SAR","score":0.4249156117},{"key-phrase":"accurate land use","score":0.4221891761},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4216377139},{"key-phrase":"optical and synthetic aperture radar","score":0.3596668839},{"key-phrase":"image analysis","score":0.3571528792},{"key-phrase":"multi-scale image segmentation","score":0.3555969596},{"key-phrase":"single and multi-scale RF classifier","score":0.3476531804},{"key-phrase":"multi-scale geographic object","score":0.3445237875},{"key-phrase":"supervised classification","score":0.3428419232},{"key-phrase":"accurate feature extraction","score":0.3427805603},{"key-phrase":"geographic information system","score":0.34257406},{"key-phrase":"feature selection","score":0.3332979083},{"key-phrase":"optimum multi-scale segmentation level","score":0.3302079439},{"key-phrase":"Multiscale RF classification","score":0.3175997734},{"key-phrase":"dual-polarization SAR","score":0.3116774559},{"key-phrase":"semi-arid environment","score":0.3112717867},{"key-phrase":"LULC classification","score":0.3060410023},{"key-phrase":"Single RF classification","score":0.284234345},{"key-phrase":"available multisource Sentinel","score":0.2763926983},{"key-phrase":"LULC map","score":0.2638729215},{"key-phrase":"machine learning capability","score":0.2594561279},{"key-phrase":"significant feature","score":0.2585970461},{"key-phrase":"score segmentation quality","score":0.2447269708},{"key-phrase":"geometrical feature","score":0.228625983},{"key-phrase":"textural feature","score":0.2240644693},{"key-phrase":"multi-sensor data","score":0.2181420326},{"key-phrase":"multi-scale level","score":0.2166076899},{"key-phrase":"natural resource","score":0.2075926065},{"key-phrase":"multi-sensor product","score":0.1904062033},{"key-phrase":"various spectral index","score":0.1897600293},{"key-phrase":"LULC class","score":0.185011059},{"key-phrase":"optical image","score":0.1797002107},{"key-phrase":"other scale SP","score":0.1618404686},{"key-phrase":"LULC extraction","score":0.1543825418},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1424296945},{"key-phrase":"optical data","score":0.1414065808},{"key-phrase":"various application","score":0.1308189332},{"key-phrase":"sensor technology","score":0.1289897561},{"key-phrase":"kappa coefficient","score":0.1256216168},{"key-phrase":"SP","score":0.1240807027},{"key-phrase":"scale SP value","score":0.1183687299},{"key-phrase":"human-environment system","score":0.116254583},{"key-phrase":"low-cost planning","score":0.0978973955},{"key-phrase":"LULC","score":0.0964081287},{"key-phrase":"scale value","score":0.0950609148},{"key-phrase":"relevant feature","score":0.0935569629},{"key-phrase":"crucial data source","score":0.0912607312},{"key-phrase":"scale parameter","score":0.0886704475},{"key-phrase":"effective and promising method","score":0.0883951336},{"key-phrase":"wrapper approach","score":0.0794940144},{"key-phrase":"approach feature","score":0.0782273114},{"key-phrase":"multiple ratio","score":0.0775219351},{"key-phrase":"high-quality LULC","score":0.0746587589},{"key-phrase":"data complementarity","score":0.070248507},{"key-phrase":"promising advantage","score":0.024272833},{"key-phrase":"such method","score":-0.0225024782},{"key-phrase":"remarkable potential","score":-0.0317100696}]},{"Cluster":4,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":394,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"15th European Conference on Ambient Intelligence, AmI 2019","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 30 papers.

In the last years, driven by increased availability of geo-referenced data from social or embedded sensors and remote sensing (RS) images, various methods become popular for land use analysis. This paper addresses the various methods employed in this context, as well as needed data and respective categorization, best applications of each method, and their comparison. We focus on approaches based on data from RS images, open maps and various categories of crowdsourced data. We identify and discuss the way these approaches use Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML). From our initial study we concluded that even using the same methods and the same kind of data, results depend on spatial configuration of the data, accordingly to the specificity of each region. The work described in this paper is intended to provide relevant contributions to method selection for knowledge discovery for city planning and management, taking into consideration available data and the pros and cons of each technique.

Advertising and information signs on building fa\u00e7ades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on fa\u00e7ades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of fa\u00e7ade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building fa\u00e7ades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality. The resulting approach can provide data for future research and help maintain coherent urban visual environment. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, we can easily observe the whole earth from its different sides. Therefore, this big data is important in remote sensing and could be exploited in several domains requiring image classification, natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, agriculture, urban planning. Over the last five years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) emerged as the most successful technique for the image classification task, as well as a number of other computer vision tasks. However, to train millions of parameters in CNN one requires a huge amount of annotated data. This requirement leads to a significant challenge if the available training data is limited for a target task at hand. To address this challenge, in the recent literature, researchers proposed various ways to apply a technique called Transfer Learning to transfer the knowledge gained by training CNNs parameters on some large annotated dataset to the target task with limited availability of training data. Most of our work in this paper was dedicated to proposing a hybrid classification of remote sensing images. This architecture combines Spark RDD image coding to consider image's local regions, pre-trained VGGNET-16 and UNET for image segmentation and SVM (Support Vector Machines) from spark Machine Learning to achieve labeling task. \u00a9 Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2019.

This paper shows that different artificial intelligence techniques can be combined to provide the commander with various form of intelligence augmentation and to support the decision making process. A warfare model has been developed where an AI system, representing a red unit, learns how to select the position for a target and for several improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in order to prevent the blue unit to locate the target. The blue unit is trained to reach the target by using deep reinforcement learning, while an evolutionary algorithm is used to train the red unit. These techniques do not rely on large amounts of historical data. Different approaches have been used and discussed to optimise the co-learning of the two agents, showing that optimal behaviour can be learned in an urban environment. Information about the most likely positions of the target and the IEDs can be extracted from the policy learned by the system, and used by the commander to provide intelligence augmentation while planning an operation and evaluating different possible courses of action. The reliability of this information depends on the realism of the AI system simulating the red unit, that is strictly dependent on the model used for the blue unit during the training. \u00a9 COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Conventional LOS\/MP\/NLOS classifiers, referred to as national marine electronics association (NMEA)-level and receiver independent exchange format (RINEX)-level classifiers, are usually performed using attributes extracted from basic observables or measurements such as received signal strength, satellite elevation angle, code pseudorange, etc. The NMEA\/RINEX-level classification rate is limited because the complex signal propagation in urban environment is not fully manifested in these end attributes. In this paper, LOS\/MP\/NLOS features were extracted at the baseband signal processing stage. Multicorrelator is implemented in a GPS software-defined receiver (SDR) and exploited to generate features from the autocorrelation function (ACF). A robust LOS\/MP\/NLOS classifier using a supervised machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), is then trained. It is also proposed that the Skymask and code pseudorange double difference observable are used to label the real signal type. Raw GPS intermediate frequency data were collected in urban areas in Hong Kong and were postprocessed using a self-developed SDR, which can easily output correlator-level LOS\/MP\/NLOS features. The SDR measurements were saved in the file with the format of NMEA and RINEX. A fair comparison among NMEA-, RINEX-, and correlator-level classifiers was then carried out on a common ground. Results show that the correlator-level classifier improves the metric of F1 score by about 25% over the conventional NMEA- and RINEX-level classifiers for testing data collected at different places to that of training data. In addition to this finding, correlator-level classifier is found to be more feasible in practical applications due to its less dependency on surrounding scenarios compared with theNMEA\/RINEX-level classifiers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Global positioning system (GPS); Multipath; Non-line-of-sight (NLOS); Signal classification; Software-defined receiver (SDR); Support vector machine (SVM); Urban environment","Authors":"Xu B., Jia Q., Luo Y., Hsu L.-T.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11161851","x":3.2100000381,"y":1.8799999952,"KeyPhrases":["global positioning system","signal reception classifier","autocorrelation function","urban area","robust LOS"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"global positioning system","score":0.5010801554},{"key-phrase":"signal reception classifier","score":0.4857566357},{"key-phrase":"GPS software","score":0.4458894134},{"key-phrase":"Raw GPS","score":0.4391759336},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.3769426942},{"key-phrase":"NLOS classifier","score":0.3627709746},{"key-phrase":"positioning performance","score":0.3340930939},{"key-phrase":"baseband signal processing","score":0.329881072},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3249511123},{"key-phrase":"signal strength","score":0.3152215481},{"key-phrase":"level classifier","score":0.3077875376},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.2853780687},{"key-phrase":"NLOS feature","score":0.2679478526},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.2662712336},{"key-phrase":"satellite elevation angle","score":0.2454579175},{"key-phrase":"complex signal propagation","score":0.2422010601},{"key-phrase":"real signal type","score":0.2377370596},{"key-phrase":"correlator","score":0.2201149464},{"key-phrase":"level classification rate","score":0.2141108364},{"key-phrase":"autocorrelation function","score":0.2106177807},{"key-phrase":"supervised machine","score":0.2100400776},{"key-phrase":"SDR measurement","score":0.1973960698},{"key-phrase":"output correlator","score":0.1938512623},{"key-phrase":"national marine electronics association","score":0.1870372295},{"key-phrase":"intermediate frequency data","score":0.1850998104},{"key-phrase":"robust LOS","score":0.175514847},{"key-phrase":"conventional NMEA","score":0.1638125479},{"key-phrase":"Hong Kong","score":0.1383908689},{"key-phrase":"code pseudorange","score":0.1366483867},{"key-phrase":"level LOS","score":0.1345719993},{"key-phrase":"different place","score":0.1020745486},{"key-phrase":"basic observables","score":0.0902257115},{"key-phrase":"F1 score","score":0.0847286955},{"key-phrase":"practical application","score":0.0781813413},{"key-phrase":"Conventional LOS","score":0.0730810761},{"key-phrase":"common ground","score":0.0642917454},{"key-phrase":"independent exchange format","score":0.0594440065},{"key-phrase":"testing data","score":0.0469064489},{"key-phrase":"double difference","score":0.0161394514},{"key-phrase":"Result show","score":-0.0001032827},{"key-phrase":"fair comparison","score":-0.0278713331},{"key-phrase":"RINEX","score":-0.0489368364}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":401,"Cited by":null,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Multi-criteria Evaluation vs Perceived Urban Quality: An Exploratory Comparison","Abstract":"This study compares a service-based and environmental evaluation of an urban area with that of its perceived walkability.

While case studies on these cities provide valuable insights, comparability and scalability remain sidelined. It is therefore timely to review the state-of-the-art in data infrastructures, including earth observations, social media data, and how they could be better integrated to advance climate change science in cities and urban areas. We present three routes for expanding knowledge on global urban areas: mainstreaming data collections, amplifying the use of big data and taking further advantage of computational methods to analyse qualitative data to gain new insights. These data-based approaches have the potential to upscale urban climate solutions and effect change at the global scale. Technical summary Cities have an increasingly integral role in addressing climate change. To gain a common understanding of solutions, we require adequate and representative data of urban areas, including data on related greenhouse gas emissions, climate threats and of socio-economic contexts. Here, we review the current state of urban data science in the context of climate change, investigating the contribution of urban metabolism studies, remote sensing, big data approaches, urban economics, urban climate and weather studies. We outline three routes for upscaling urban data science for global climate solutions: 1) Mainstreaming and harmonizing data collection in cities worldwide; 2) Exploiting big data and machine learning to scale solutions while maintaining privacy; 3) Applying computational techniques and data science methods to analyse published qualitative information for the systematization and understanding of first-order climate effects and solutions. Collaborative efforts towards a joint data platform and integrated urban services would provide the quantitative foundations of the emerging global urban sustainability science. \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).","Author Keywords":"adaptation and mitigation; policies; politics and governance; urban systems","Authors":"Creutzig F., Lohrey S., Bai X., Baklanov A., Dawson R., Dhakal S., Lamb W.F., McPhearson T., Minx J., Munoz E., Walsh B.","DOI":"10.1017\/sus.2018.16","x":13.3999996185,"y":0.75,"KeyPhrases":["global urban sustainability science","big data","first-order climate","upscale urban climate solution","Non-technical summary Manhattan"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"global urban sustainability science","score":0.670933187},{"key-phrase":"urban data science","score":0.6461786032},{"key-phrase":"urban climate","score":0.6042298675},{"key-phrase":"upscale urban climate solution","score":0.5654727221},{"key-phrase":"global urban area","score":0.5645626783},{"key-phrase":"urban metabolism study","score":0.4878965616},{"key-phrase":"climate change science","score":0.4639851451},{"key-phrase":"urban economics","score":0.4599984288},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4249485135},{"key-phrase":"global climate solution","score":0.4052878618},{"key-phrase":"Technical summary City","score":0.401286304},{"key-phrase":"big data approach","score":0.3963363469},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.3928357661},{"key-phrase":"climate","score":0.3895281553},{"key-phrase":"weather study","score":0.3875150383},{"key-phrase":"climate change","score":0.3802270889},{"key-phrase":"Non-technical summary Manhattan","score":0.3731538057},{"key-phrase":"climate threat","score":0.3725021482},{"key-phrase":"data science method","score":0.3650643826},{"key-phrase":"urban service","score":0.3566843271},{"key-phrase":"greenhouse gas emission","score":0.3415627778},{"key-phrase":"data collection","score":0.3169336617},{"key-phrase":"harmonizing data collection","score":0.3100285232},{"key-phrase":"first-order climate","score":0.3082008958},{"key-phrase":"related greenhouse gas","score":0.303681016},{"key-phrase":"qualitative data","score":0.2922775149},{"key-phrase":"earth observation","score":0.2757836282},{"key-phrase":"social medium data","score":0.2660011053},{"key-phrase":"data infrastructure","score":0.2653863132},{"key-phrase":"joint data platform","score":0.2480699271},{"key-phrase":"global scale","score":0.2443249375},{"key-phrase":"adequate and representative data","score":0.2307874262},{"key-phrase":"quantitative foundation","score":0.2302167863},{"key-phrase":"qualitative information","score":0.2220733762},{"key-phrase":"New Delhi","score":0.2074709833},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2011045367},{"key-phrase":"computational technique","score":0.1933902502},{"key-phrase":"computational method","score":0.1754032075},{"key-phrase":"economic contexts","score":0.1482982635},{"key-phrase":"science","score":0.1217679009},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1162321121},{"key-phrase":"new insight","score":0.1111924574},{"key-phrase":"common understanding","score":0.1109502986},{"key-phrase":"valuable insight","score":0.1014812216},{"key-phrase":"effect change","score":0.0974339247},{"key-phrase":"integral role","score":0.0483122133},{"key-phrase":"current state","score":0.046313867},{"key-phrase":"Collaborative effort","score":0.041686736},{"key-phrase":"further advantage","score":0.0265619084}]},{"Cluster":3,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":407,"Cited by":14.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Smart mobile crowdsensing with urban vehicles: A deep reinforcement learning perspective","Abstract":"Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a promising sensing paradigm based on the mobile node which provides the solution with cost-effectiveness to perform urban data collection. To monitor the urban environment and facilitate the municipal administration, more and more applications adopt vehicles as participants to carry out MCS tasks. The performance of the applications highly depends on the sensing data which is influenced by the recruiting strategy on vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel vehicle selection algorithm to maximize the sensing range with limited cost while the vehicle selection problem was proved to be NP-complete. Specifically, we modeled the interaction between MCS server and candidate vehicles as a Markov decision process and formulated the maximum spatial temporal coverage (STC) optimization as a deep reinforcement learning process. The performance of our deep reinforcement learning-based vehicle selection (i.e., DRLVS) algorithm is evaluated with real trajectory dataset. The numerical result indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves an optimal solution and maximizes the STC. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"deep reinforcement learning; Mobile crowdsensing; spatialoral coverage","Authors":"Wang C., Gaimu X., Li C., Zou H., Wang W.","DOI":"10.1109\/ACCESS.2019.2905263","x":5.81,"y":-1.78,"KeyPhrases":["Mobile crowdsensing","deep reinforcement learning","spatial temporal coverage","vehicle selection problem","real trajectory dataset"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Mobile crowdsensing","score":0.4997573495},{"key-phrase":"deep reinforcement learning","score":0.456567347},{"key-phrase":"spatial temporal coverage","score":0.4498662353},{"key-phrase":"urban data collection","score":0.4396291673},{"key-phrase":"deep reinforcement","score":0.3875965476},{"key-phrase":"novel vehicle selection","score":0.3849679232},{"key-phrase":"vehicle selection","score":0.3605585098},{"key-phrase":"vehicle selection problem","score":0.3521690071},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3486571908},{"key-phrase":"Markov decision process","score":0.3181931674},{"key-phrase":"real trajectory dataset","score":0.3082270622},{"key-phrase":"mobile node","score":0.2790344954},{"key-phrase":"vehicle","score":0.2770259976},{"key-phrase":"candidate vehicle","score":0.2692662477},{"key-phrase":"optimal solution","score":0.2627645731},{"key-phrase":"MCS task","score":0.2589275837},{"key-phrase":"municipal administration","score":0.1792216599},{"key-phrase":"MCS server","score":0.1676864028},{"key-phrase":"limited cost","score":0.1368462592},{"key-phrase":"recruiting strategy","score":0.11735484},{"key-phrase":"MCS","score":0.1090641469},{"key-phrase":"numerical result","score":0.0034658224}]},{"Cluster":31,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":408,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Book Chapter","Title":"A multiscale clustering of the urban morphology for use in quantitative models","Abstract":"Geo-spatial data available to researchers and practitioners has increased substantially over the last decades, offering new opportunities for analyzing and characterizing locations and their spatial environment in an objective way. Various studies in the field of urban planning and design have given recommendations on \u201cgood urban form\u201d, suggesting that especially characteristics of the urban morphology inform the quality of locations and additionally influence spatial behavior. While we find a growing number of quantitative spatial models such as hedonic price models, location choice models, or applied machine learning algorithms, characteristics describing the urban morphology are still rarely reported in these. One reason can be found in the limited knowledge on how to characterize the urban morphology best. In this chapter, we address this deficit and define attributes that are suitable to characterize the urban morphology in quantitative means at different scales. We show how these can be processed from a data model that is simple enough to allow for reproducibility in most study areas and process them for the case study of Switzerland. Finally, we use the attributes to define urban typologies through clustering methods. These are compared on their outcome, their consistency, and interpretation. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Schirmer P.M., Axhausen K.W.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-12381-9_16","x":5.7699999809,"y":3.4500000477,"KeyPhrases":["urban morphology","hedonic price model","clustering method","quantitative spatial model","characterize"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban morphology","score":0.6561188698},{"key-phrase":"urban typology","score":0.6495944262},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.6277526617},{"key-phrase":"quantitative spatial model","score":0.5336760283},{"key-phrase":"spatial data","score":0.5025475621},{"key-phrase":"good urban form","score":0.4969417155},{"key-phrase":"location choice model","score":0.4794253409},{"key-phrase":"spatial environment","score":0.3557431996},{"key-phrase":"clustering method","score":0.3386547565},{"key-phrase":"spatial behavior","score":0.3194428682},{"key-phrase":"morphology","score":0.2795491219},{"key-phrase":"hedonic price model","score":0.2662638426},{"key-phrase":"quantitative mean","score":0.254607141},{"key-phrase":"data model","score":0.2495070398},{"key-phrase":"characterize","score":0.2443851531},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.243969962},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.2267378271},{"key-phrase":"objective way","score":0.1635800898},{"key-phrase":"Various study","score":0.147857815},{"key-phrase":"different scale","score":0.1184380502},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1042353511},{"key-phrase":"new opportunity","score":0.0322391614},{"key-phrase":"last decade","score":0.0205368362},{"key-phrase":"limited knowledge","score":0.0144694149}]},{"Cluster":27,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":409,"Cited by":11.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Generative design and performance modeling for relationships between urban built forms, sky opening, solar radiation and energy","Abstract":"For the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the performance of urban form scenarios such as sky view factors, solar radiation, or energy performance. Simulation-based performance analysis has been applied for optimizing urban design using multiple performance criteria of energy demands, daylighting, or radiance. Two major limitations exist in the performance evaluation methods of urban design: 1) the number of urban design alternatives or scenarios has been limited, and 2) various performance criteria and metrics have not been assessed synthetically. In this respect, we aim to generate all possible alternatives under constraints such as a city policy or development requirements. This paper addresses the integration of generative design and multi-criteria performance analysis for urban design decision making. The relationships between geometric urban forms and multiple performance criteria are identified. The proposed methodology incorporates the reinforcement learning algorithm, an advanced machine learning technique, along with parametric modeling techniques, to enhance urban design decisions based on various performance criteria. This methodology was tested on the design of an international campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, located in Shenzhen, China. An algorithm generates numerous geometrical alternatives of campus design under site constraints and development requirements of the campus. Those alternatives are then evaluated based on performance criteria of sky openings, solar radiation, or energy consumption synthetically. The method enables an integrated performance analysis for all possible design under constraints. The paper proposes a data driven urban design approach that connect generative design and multi-criteria performance analyses.

With this available information, the automated extraction of spatiotemporal patterns is crucial to understand the people\u2019s mobility. These patterns can assist in improving the smart city environments like traffic control, urban planning, and transportation facilities. The smartphone generated spatiotemporal data is enriched with multiple contexts and efficiently utilizing them in a Machine Learning process is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a Nonnegative Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (CMTF) model to integrate and analyze additional contexts with spatiotemporal data to generate meaningful patterns. We also propose an efficient factorization algorithm based on variable selection to solve the Nonnegative CMTF model that yields accurate spatiotemporal patterns. Our empirical analysis highlights the efficiency of the proposed CMTF model in terms of accuracy and factor goodness. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Author Keywords":"Greedy coordinate descent; Nonnegative coupled matrix tensor factorization; Pattern mining; Smart city; Spatiotemporal; Variable selection","Authors":"Balasubramaniam T., Nayak R., Yuen C.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-030-13709-0_44","x":5.6,"y":-2.94,"KeyPhrases":["Matrix Tensor Factorization","spatiotemporal data","Nonnegative CMTF model","smart city environment","additional contexts"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Matrix Tensor Factorization","score":0.517619729},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal data","score":0.4924972653},{"key-phrase":"efficient factorization algorithm","score":0.4274567962},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal activity","score":0.4139483571},{"key-phrase":"accurate spatiotemporal pattern","score":0.4052975774},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal pattern","score":0.3926015794},{"key-phrase":"smart city environment","score":0.3528277576},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal","score":0.3154984713},{"key-phrase":"Machine Learning process","score":0.2872391939},{"key-phrase":"meaningful pattern","score":0.284032017},{"key-phrase":"traffic control","score":0.2644553781},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2471591532},{"key-phrase":"multiple contexts","score":0.2279898375},{"key-phrase":"Nonnegative CMTF model","score":0.2255510688},{"key-phrase":"additional contexts","score":0.2202858031},{"key-phrase":"factor goodness","score":0.2068328559},{"key-phrase":"variable selection","score":0.1803362966},{"key-phrase":"empirical analysis","score":0.1725003421},{"key-phrase":"transportation facility","score":0.1610251665},{"key-phrase":"inbuilt sensor","score":0.1557375938},{"key-phrase":"CMTF model","score":0.1363599002},{"key-phrase":"available information","score":0.1181835383},{"key-phrase":"challenging task","score":0.1125874817},{"key-phrase":"CMTF","score":0.0429857895}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":411,"Cited by":24.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Daily accessed street greenery and housing price: Measuring economic performance of human-scale streetscapes via new urban data","Abstract":"The protective effects of street greenery on ecological, psychological, and behavioral phenomena have been well recognized. Nevertheless, the potential economic effect of daily accessed street greenery, i.e., a human-scale and perceptual-oriented quality focusing on exposure to street greenery in people's daily lives, has not been fully studied because a quantitative measuring of this human-scale indicator is hard to achieve. This study was an attempt in this direction with the help of new urban data and new analytical tools. Shanghai, which has a mature real estate market, was selected for study, and the housing prices of 1395 private neighborhoods in its city center were collected. We selected more than forty variables that were classified under five categories-location features, distances to the closest facilities, density of facilities within a certain radius, housing and neighborhood features, and daily accessed street greenery-in a hedonic pricing model. The distance and density of facilities were computed through a massive number of points-of-interest and a geographical information system. The visible street greenery was collected from Baidu street view images and then measured via a machine-learning algorithm, while accessibility was measured through space syntax. In addition to the well-recognized effects previously discovered, the results show that visible street greenery and street accessibility at global scale hold significant positive coefficients for housing prices. Visible street greenery even obtains the second-highest regression coefficient in the model. Moreover, the combined assessment, the co-presence of local-scale accessibility and eye-level greenery, is significant for housing price as well. This study provides a scientific and quantitative support for the significance of human-scale street greenery, making it an important issue in urban greening policy for urban planners and decision makers. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Daily accessed street greenery; Housing price; Human scale; New urban data; Shanghai; Street view images","Authors":"Ye Y., Xie H., Fang J., Jiang H., Wang D.","DOI":"10.3390\/su11061741","x":7.52,"y":-4.49,"KeyPhrases":["visible street greenery","hedonic pricing model","new urban data","urban greening policy","human-scale indicator"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"visible street greenery","score":0.619007349},{"key-phrase":"street greenery","score":0.6160555482},{"key-phrase":"urban greening policy","score":0.5879599452},{"key-phrase":"street accessibility","score":0.4490827322},{"key-phrase":"Baidu street view","score":0.4025294781},{"key-phrase":"new urban data","score":0.3933891654},{"key-phrase":"human-scale street","score":0.3891204596},{"key-phrase":"greenery","score":0.3671186864},{"key-phrase":"level greenery","score":0.3626126051},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3048982322},{"key-phrase":"hedonic pricing model","score":0.3008718491},{"key-phrase":"housing price","score":0.2958885133},{"key-phrase":"local-scale accessibility","score":0.2894870043},{"key-phrase":"private neighborhood","score":0.2893937826},{"key-phrase":"potential economic effect","score":0.2873783708},{"key-phrase":"mature real estate market","score":0.2813329995},{"key-phrase":"street","score":0.278863579},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood feature","score":0.2722678781},{"key-phrase":"geographical information system","score":0.2427252233},{"key-phrase":"perceptual-oriented quality","score":0.2178902328},{"key-phrase":"second-highestS regression","score":0.2167550325},{"key-phrase":"human-scale indicator","score":0.198067829},{"key-phrase":"city center","score":0.1922871321},{"key-phrase":"location feature","score":0.1838862896},{"key-phrase":"quantitative measuring","score":0.1804174483},{"key-phrase":"daily life","score":0.1690440476},{"key-phrase":"protective effect","score":0.1355760396},{"key-phrase":"global scale","score":0.1294769049},{"key-phrase":"behavioral phenomenon","score":0.1268215626},{"key-phrase":"significant positive coefficient","score":0.0983332694},{"key-phrase":"space syntax","score":0.0972142965},{"key-phrase":"important issue","score":0.0891751945},{"key-phrase":"scientific and quantitative support","score":0.0853022784},{"key-phrase":"certain radius","score":0.0731836483},{"key-phrase":"new analytical tool","score":0.0713471547},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.0627127588},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0338131934},{"key-phrase":"massive number","score":0.0228247009}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":412,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Analyzing Objective and Subjective Data in Social Sciences: Implications for Smart Cities","Abstract":"The ease of deployment of digital technologies and the Internet of Things gives us the opportunity to carry out large-scale social studies and to collect vast amounts of data from our cities.

The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas.

However, as various different of approaches to estimate the current distribution of population and dwellings exists, further evidence on past dynamics is needed for a better understanding of urban processes. This article therefore addresses the question of whether and how accurately historical distributions of dwellings and inhabitants can be reconstructed with commonly available geodata from national mapping and cadastral agencies. For this purpose, an approach for the automatic derivation of such information is presented. The data basis is constituted by a current digital landscape model and a 3D building model combined with historical land use information automatically extracted from historical topographic maps. For this purpose, methods of image processing, machine learning, change detection and dasymetric mapping are applied. The results for a study area in Germany show that it is possible to automatically derive decadal historical patterns of population and dwellings from 1950 to 2011 at the level of a 100 m grid with slight underestimations and acceptable standard deviations. By a differentiated analysis we were able to quantify the errors for different urban structure types. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Dasymetric mapping; Dwelling units; Dynamics; Estimation; Historical demography; Multi-temporal; Population; Topographic maps; Urban morphology; Urban planning","Authors":"Hecht R., Herold H., Behnisch M., Jehling M.","DOI":"10.3390\/ijgi8010002","x":6.6799998283,"y":5.4499998093,"KeyPhrases":["different urban structure type","historical distribution","change detection","historical topographic map","current digital landscape model"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"different urban structure type","score":0.5237078071},{"key-phrase":"historical land use","score":0.4744260609},{"key-phrase":"land use planning","score":0.4470539689},{"key-phrase":"3D building model","score":0.4373259842},{"key-phrase":"national mapping","score":0.4359611273},{"key-phrase":"historical topographic map","score":0.4344765246},{"key-phrase":"urban process","score":0.4080188274},{"key-phrase":"current digital landscape model","score":0.3307567835},{"key-phrase":"change detection","score":0.3281739652},{"key-phrase":"dasymetric mapping","score":0.325784266},{"key-phrase":"available geodata","score":0.2911812365},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2876868546},{"key-phrase":"data basis","score":0.2699853182},{"key-phrase":"historical distribution","score":0.2640144229},{"key-phrase":"image processing","score":0.2503623962},{"key-phrase":"historical pattern","score":0.2340474427},{"key-phrase":"automatic derivation","score":0.230687663},{"key-phrase":"dwelling","score":0.2151435018},{"key-phrase":"disaster management","score":0.210706532},{"key-phrase":"risk assessment","score":0.2095613927},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1751833856},{"key-phrase":"various field","score":0.1450338662},{"key-phrase":"m grid","score":0.1341531277},{"key-phrase":"historical","score":0.132848233},{"key-phrase":"cadastral agency","score":0.1195597798},{"key-phrase":"slight underestimation","score":0.1115171164},{"key-phrase":"such information","score":0.1103459075},{"key-phrase":"acceptable standard deviation","score":0.0973982662},{"key-phrase":"energy provision","score":0.0921213478},{"key-phrase":"current distribution","score":0.0652595237},{"key-phrase":"further evidence","score":-0.0042810892}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":414,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Automating layout synthesis with constructive preference elicitation","Abstract":"Layout synthesis refers to the problem of arranging objects subject to design preferences and structural constraints. Applications include furniture arrangement, space partitioning (e.g. subdividing a house into rooms), urban planning, and other design tasks. Computer-aided support systems are essential tools for architects and designers to produce custom, functional layouts. Existing systems, however, do not learn the designer\u2019s preferences, and therefore fail to generalize across sessions or instances. We propose addressing layout synthesis by casting it as a constructive preference elicitation task. Our solution employs a coactive interaction protocol, whereby the system and the designer interact by mutually improving each other\u2019s proposals. The system iteratively recommends layouts to the user, and learns the user\u2019s preferences by observing her improvements to the recommendations. We apply our system to two design tasks, furniture arrangement and space partitioning, and report promising quantitative and qualitative results on both.

Analysing and then disseminating the behaviours and other factors underpinning positive deviance are demonstrably effective in delivering development results.

In this paper, using a systematic literature review, we analyse the current state of positive deviance and the potential for big data to address the challenges facing positive deviance.

While big data cannot solve all the challenges facing positive deviance as a development tool, they could reduce time, cost, and effort; identify positive deviants in new or better ways; and enable positive deviance to break out of its current preoccupation with public health into domains such as agriculture, education, and urban planning.

Understanding these perceptions may be useful to inform the design, management and planning process of public spaces. Recently, several studies have used data collected at a massive scale and machine learning methods to quantify these perceptions, showing promising results in terms of predictive performance. Nevertheless, most of these models can be of little help in understanding users\u2019 perceptions due to the difficulty associated with identifying the importance of each attribute of landscapes. In this work, we propose a novel approach to quantify perceptions of landscapes through discrete choice models, using semantic segmentations of images of public spaces, generated through machine learning algorithms, as explanatory variables. The proposed models are estimated using the Place Pulse dataset, with over 1.2 million perceptual indicators, and are able to provide useful insights into how users perceive the built environment as a function of its features. The models obtained are used to infer perceptual variables in the city of Santiago, Chile, and show they have a significant correlation with socioeconomic indicators. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Discrete choice models; Machine learning; Perceptions; Public spaces","Authors":"Rossetti T., Lobel H., Rocco V., Hurtubia R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.09.020","x":7.24,"y":-4.56,"KeyPhrases":["public space","machine learning algorithms","discrete choice model","environment influence","Place Pulse dataset"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"public space","score":0.3639060557},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithms","score":0.3590813279},{"key-phrase":"perception","score":0.3235600591},{"key-phrase":"perceptual variable","score":0.321388185},{"key-phrase":"semantic segmentation","score":0.320427537},{"key-phrase":"People's perception","score":0.3196689487},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.3160524964},{"key-phrase":"Place Pulse dataset","score":0.2752806842},{"key-phrase":"environment influence","score":0.2593704462},{"key-phrase":"discrete choice model","score":0.2568243444},{"key-phrase":"perceptual","score":0.2553539276},{"key-phrase":"planning process","score":0.234812364},{"key-phrase":"perceptual indicator","score":0.2289745212},{"key-phrase":"socioeconomic indicator","score":0.1856021583},{"key-phrase":"understanding user","score":0.1821279079},{"key-phrase":"massive scale","score":0.1743028909},{"key-phrase":"predictive performance","score":0.1731235087},{"key-phrase":"explanatory variable","score":0.1218698174},{"key-phrase":"significant correlation","score":0.0909449607},{"key-phrase":"useful insight","score":0.0850851461},{"key-phrase":"several study","score":0.0640874803},{"key-phrase":"novel approach","score":0.0463865548},{"key-phrase":"promising result","score":0.0113819633},{"key-phrase":"little help","score":0.0100750979}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":417,"Cited by":18.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Where to go and what to do: Extracting leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space","Abstract":"Web data is the most prominent source of information for deciding where to go and what to do. Exploiting this source for geographic analysis, however, does not come without difficulties. First, in recent years, the amount and diversity of available Web information about urban space have exploded, and it is therefore increasingly difficult to overview and exploit. Second, the bulk of information is in an unstructured form which is difficult to process and interpret by computers. Third, semi-structured sources, such as Web rankings, geolocated tags, check-ins, or mobile sensor data, do not fully reflect the more subtle qualities of a place, including the particular functions that make it attractive. In this article, we explore a method to capture leisure activity potentials from Web data on urban space using semantic topic models. We test three supervised multi-label machine learning strategies exploiting geolocated webtexts and place tags to estimate whether a given type of leisure activity is afforded or not. We train and validate these models on a manually curated dataset labeled with leisure ontology classes for the city of Zwolle, and discuss their potential for urban leisure and tourism research and related city policies and planning. We found that multi-label affordance estimation is not straightforward but can be made to work using both official webtexts and user-generated content on a medium semantic level. This opens up new opportunities for data-driven approaches to urban leisure and tourism studies. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"City planning; Knowledge extraction; Latent semantics; Multi-label classification; Place affordance; Urban space","Authors":"van Weerdenburg D., Scheider S., Adams B., Spierings B., van der Zee E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2018.09.005","x":6.07,"y":-3.66,"KeyPhrases":["urban leisure","semantic topic model","Web data","multi-label affordance estimation","place tag"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban leisure","score":0.5195602179},{"key-phrase":"tourism research","score":0.450722307},{"key-phrase":"leisure activity potential","score":0.436177969},{"key-phrase":"semantic topic model","score":0.435053736},{"key-phrase":"geographic analysis","score":0.4328274727},{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.4203575552},{"key-phrase":"tourism study","score":0.3984608054},{"key-phrase":"leisure","score":0.3700288832},{"key-phrase":"multi-label machine learning","score":0.3615991175},{"key-phrase":"Web data","score":0.3593887985},{"key-phrase":"leisure activity","score":0.356123209},{"key-phrase":"leisure ontology class","score":0.3519178927},{"key-phrase":"related city policy","score":0.3405262232},{"key-phrase":"Web ranking","score":0.3103559613},{"key-phrase":"multi-label affordance estimation","score":0.2928464115},{"key-phrase":"place tag","score":0.2789026499},{"key-phrase":"web","score":0.2750666142},{"key-phrase":"official webtexts","score":0.2627390623},{"key-phrase":"medium semantic level","score":0.2548518777},{"key-phrase":"mobile sensor data","score":0.2346010357},{"key-phrase":"available Web information","score":0.2225245535},{"key-phrase":"prominent source","score":0.2021405995},{"key-phrase":"unstructured form","score":0.1636240631},{"key-phrase":"new opportunity","score":0.12539047},{"key-phrase":"semi-structured source","score":0.1035667732},{"key-phrase":"subtle quality","score":0.0654204562},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0570158884},{"key-phrase":"particular function","score":0.0415190607}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":418,"Cited by":34.0,"Year":2019,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Building extraction from LiDAR data applying deep convolutional neural networks","Abstract":"Deep learning paradigm has been shown to be a very efficient classification framework for many application scenarios, including the analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for building detection. In fact, deep learning acts as a set of mathematical transformations, encoding the raw input data into appropriate forms of representations that maximize the classification performance. However, it is clear that mathematical computations alone, even highly nonlinear, are not adequate to model the physical properties of a problem, distinguishing, for example, the building structures from vegetation. In this letter, we address this difficulty by augmenting the raw LiDAR data with features coming from a physical interpretation of the information. Then, we exploit a deep learning paradigm based on a convolutional neural network model to find out the best input representations suitable for the classification.

The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity.

In this article, we proposed transportation modes classification method based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to discover seven kinds of transportation modes from GPS trajectory data, including walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a taxi, driving a car, taking the subway and taking a train. First, the original trajectories must be divided into some sub trajectories. There is only one transportation mode label in each sub trajectory. Second, the feature vector of sub trajectory is computed including eight basic and three advanced features. These basic features are distance feature, five velocity-related features and two acceleration-related features.

This paper proposes a novel utility model for structural health monitoring that would enable early detection of risk factors and mitigation of loss. The proposed utility computing model takes the input data in terms of 'number of occupants' in a building (i.e. MAC, International Mobile Equipment Identifier addresses and biometric attendance system installed) and SHM system data (i.e. sensors readings). It give visual representation of all the data for utility managers and experts to decide better location of SHM and number of SHM needed per zone depending on high disturbances created due to higher occupancy and number of structures per zone. Denser area with higher structures and higher population will require more precise and accurate SHM systems compared to rural areas. It also analyzes the data from SHM system and using simple machine learning algorithm give experts' suggestions for type of SHM needed at an area. It make it possible for the data of each and every device of SHM systems over several zones to be accessible by specific authorities that can be used to predict as well as forecast any natural disaster. The Structural Health Monitoring utility model is unique in terms of its heterogeneity of resource management in realizing the utility processes. Finally, a case study of Qatar University is looked at where nodes are distributed in zones along with occupant measuring is used over each building. The data was taken over simulated occupation models and mathematical models from literature for occupation and zone calculation using ideal SHM system data. It can be inferred from the data that real-time analysis data will act similar to simulated and proposed Utility Computing System will give visual data and analyze the zones as can be seen in the results. Therefore, SHM Utility Computing model is efficient and most effective system that save cost as well as prepare authorities for maintenance of a structure or crisis management due to external surroundings. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Geographical Area Network (GAN); Internet of Things (IoT); Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Things as a Service (TaaS); Utility Computing","Authors":"Tariq H., Al-Hitmi M.A.E., Tahir A., Crescini D., Touati F., Manouer A.B.","DOI":"10.1109\/EECS.2018.00019","x":13.0100002289,"y":2.8800001144,"KeyPhrases":["structural health monitoring","utility computing model","zone calculation","urban planning","biometric attendance system"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"structural health monitoring","score":0.5566827059},{"key-phrase":"Utility Computing System","score":0.3441051543},{"key-phrase":"simulated occupation model","score":0.3277879953},{"key-phrase":"utility computing model","score":0.2995282412},{"key-phrase":"SHM Utility Computing","score":0.2976176739},{"key-phrase":"structural information","score":0.2870409787},{"key-phrase":"sensor reading","score":0.2856065929},{"key-phrase":"SHM system data","score":0.2854077518},{"key-phrase":"precise and accurate SHM system","score":0.2779638171},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.275842011},{"key-phrase":"resource management","score":0.2747570276},{"key-phrase":"SHM system","score":0.2637892365},{"key-phrase":"visual data","score":0.2621822059},{"key-phrase":"biometric attendance system","score":0.2382266521},{"key-phrase":"occupant measuring","score":0.2376142442},{"key-phrase":"natural disaster","score":0.2286041826},{"key-phrase":"efficient environment","score":0.2284938991},{"key-phrase":"time analysis data","score":0.2260192484},{"key-phrase":"utility model","score":0.2226570845},{"key-phrase":"zone calculation","score":0.2153714299},{"key-phrase":"utility","score":0.2014113814},{"key-phrase":"input data","score":0.1904734373},{"key-phrase":"ideal SHM system","score":0.1881254613},{"key-phrase":"novel utility model","score":0.1856435835},{"key-phrase":"crisis management","score":0.1854501069},{"key-phrase":"International Mobile Equipment","score":0.1840952635},{"key-phrase":"utility manager","score":0.1823633611},{"key-phrase":"mathematical model","score":0.1823215485},{"key-phrase":"several zone","score":0.177529797},{"key-phrase":"early detection","score":0.1658569276},{"key-phrase":"utility processes","score":0.1470468938},{"key-phrase":"rural area","score":0.1444804668},{"key-phrase":"high disturbance","score":0.1408957243},{"key-phrase":"external surroundings","score":0.1407695115},{"key-phrase":"effective system","score":0.1254953891},{"key-phrase":"visual representation","score":0.1230079308},{"key-phrase":"simple machine","score":0.1099618152},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1087035984},{"key-phrase":"natural phenomenon","score":0.1033753753},{"key-phrase":"SHM","score":0.1017336249},{"key-phrase":"risk factor","score":0.0943633318},{"key-phrase":"Identifier address","score":0.0825298503},{"key-phrase":"Qatar University","score":0.0626383871},{"key-phrase":"specific authority","score":0.0482543968}]},{"Cluster":5,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":425,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Dimensionality Reduction to Reveal Urban Truck Driver Activity Patterns","Abstract":"This paper studies the activity profiles of truck drivers in urban areas. Finding repeating dynamical patterns is important in understanding freight behaviors, and aids freight-friendly planning. In the digital age, data on truck drivers is becoming more available with heterogeneous demographic and work profiles. By synthesizing such pervasive data and applying machine learning concepts, this paper proposes to identify signature travel activity patterns via dimensionality reduction. Based on driver survey data, truck drivers\u2019 behaviors are represented as longitudinal activity sequences. Dimensionality reduction and activity reconstruction via principal components analysis (PCA), logistic PCA, and autoencoder were conducted to reveal fundamental activity features and approximate the underlying data-generating function. In the driver survey dataset, 243 truck drivers in Singapore reported their daily activities for 1,099 weekdays. This study found that PCA produced the most faithful reconstruction of drivers\u2019 activities. When projecting the input data down from 2,592 to 82 dimensions, PCA explained 77% of variances with a reconstruction error of 0.99%. Logistic PCA is a useful extension of PCA to study the pattern of a single activity. It captures the variation of infrequent activities such as truck queuing, which PCA fails to reconstruct. Autoencoder was found to be more powerful than PCA in reconstructing activities \u2013 with 1% of original dimensions, it reconstructed the activities with an error rate of 1.24%. Moreover, when implemented as a variational autoencoder, autoencoder generated realistic-looking samples of driver activities. The top three most distinctive activity patterns of Singapore truck drivers are reported using PCA. \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2018.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Lu F., Zhao F., Cheah L.","DOI":"10.1177\/0361198118787105","x":5.51,"y":-2.58,"KeyPhrases":["distinctive activity pattern","dimensionality reduction","driver survey data","variational autoencoder","freight behavior"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"distinctive activity pattern","score":0.4793410301},{"key-phrase":"driver survey data","score":0.4531250894},{"key-phrase":"principal component analysis","score":0.4491345584},{"key-phrase":"dimensionality reduction","score":0.4412181377},{"key-phrase":"logistic PCA","score":0.4290597439},{"key-phrase":"variational autoencoder","score":0.4213165045},{"key-phrase":"driver survey dataset","score":0.4197247028},{"key-phrase":"driver activity","score":0.3901466131},{"key-phrase":"PCA","score":0.3860456944},{"key-phrase":"fundamental activity feature","score":0.3764774799},{"key-phrase":"Singapore truck driver","score":0.3528934717},{"key-phrase":"activity profile","score":0.3521409929},{"key-phrase":"activity reconstruction","score":0.3503703475},{"key-phrase":"longitudinal activity sequence","score":0.3481750488},{"key-phrase":"freight behavior","score":0.327596724},{"key-phrase":"signature travel activity","score":0.324329555},{"key-phrase":"daily activity","score":0.3217503428},{"key-phrase":"infrequent activity","score":0.3198796511},{"key-phrase":"truck driver","score":0.3130733371},{"key-phrase":"machine learning concept","score":0.3090140224},{"key-phrase":"such pervasive data","score":0.302146107},{"key-phrase":"single activity","score":0.2869403958},{"key-phrase":"truck queuing","score":0.278845787},{"key-phrase":"truck","score":0.2749005556},{"key-phrase":"dynamical pattern","score":0.2727382183},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.268501997},{"key-phrase":"input data","score":0.2501938939},{"key-phrase":"aid freight","score":0.1813596189},{"key-phrase":"original dimension","score":0.1539351493},{"key-phrase":"digital age","score":0.1505866945},{"key-phrase":"friendly planning","score":0.1392787993},{"key-phrase":"paper study","score":0.1370061785},{"key-phrase":"useful extension","score":0.1227292418},{"key-phrase":"faithful reconstruction","score":0.0773076862},{"key-phrase":"reconstruction error","score":0.0719385147},{"key-phrase":"realistic-looking_VBG sample","score":0.0444139577},{"key-phrase":"error rate","score":0.0362079032}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":426,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Predicting multiple land use transitions under rapid urbanization and implications for land management and urban planning: The case of Zhanggong District in central China","Abstract":"Numerous machine learning-based land change models have been presented by researchers over the last two decades. To date, however, far less have simulated multiple land use classes and specific land use subclasses at the same time. In some areas of the world, it is important to simulate both of these dynamics to understand fully the drivers and consequences of land change. One important example is the process of urbanization in China, as urban policies have been developed that guide urban expansion, rural protections, and urban subclass development. This paper presents a new model integrating geographic information systems (GIS) with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict multiple transitions among land use types and urban subclasses in the Zhanggong District of Ganzhou city in China. We show that the model produces satisfactory goodness of fit values-based on location, quantity and spatial configuration-between simulated and observed land use maps for 2015. Our simulated future maps produced by the model for 2020 and 2025 demonstrate that transitions from farmland and forest to urban will remain the main pathway of urbanization although we predict that the rate will slow after 2025. The goals of urban planning should be aligned with land use planning according to \u201cCombining multiple laws and regulations\u201d in China. Taking into account the current and future land use transitions will enhance the accuracy and timeliness of land use policy making and urban land planning. For the sustainable land use in Zhanggong District, we argue for a strengthened regulation of the land market by government and believe that planning officials should guide the spatial distribution of land supply actively. Furthermore, improving the production, living and ecological functions of land resources are the key points to optimize urban land use functions and the allocation of land resources. We discuss how our model can be adapted to other areas to benefit land use management and urban planning in China. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural networks; China; Land use management; Multiple land use transitions; Urban planning; Urbanization","Authors":"Wang L., Pijanowski B., Yang W., Zhai R., Omrani H., Li K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.habitatint.2018.08.007","x":8.84,"y":-3.15,"KeyPhrases":["land change model","Ganzhou city","Numerous machine learning","urban planning","land use map"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land change model","score":0.6269801855},{"key-phrase":"urban land planning","score":0.6031187773},{"key-phrase":"urban land use","score":0.6003513336},{"key-phrase":"land use map","score":0.5660254955},{"key-phrase":"current and future land use","score":0.5636079311},{"key-phrase":"land use planning","score":0.5487025976},{"key-phrase":"land use management","score":0.5385761261},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5185043216},{"key-phrase":"land change","score":0.4953102171},{"key-phrase":"land use type","score":0.4849660099},{"key-phrase":"land use policy","score":0.4766659737},{"key-phrase":"multiple land use","score":0.4674009085},{"key-phrase":"specific land use","score":0.4615194798},{"key-phrase":"sustainable land use","score":0.4441832006},{"key-phrase":"land market","score":0.4383978248},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion","score":0.4117423892},{"key-phrase":"geographic information system","score":0.4043874145},{"key-phrase":"land supply","score":0.3876123428},{"key-phrase":"urban policy","score":0.3867871165},{"key-phrase":"urban subclass development","score":0.3721744418},{"key-phrase":"land resource","score":0.3610190749},{"key-phrase":"simulated future map","score":0.3552612662},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.3316988647},{"key-phrase":"land","score":0.3306623697},{"key-phrase":"Zhanggong District","score":0.2856503129},{"key-phrase":"urban subclass","score":0.2795550823},{"key-phrase":"Numerous machine learning","score":0.2646603882},{"key-phrase":"Ganzhou city","score":0.2573567927},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.2436000258},{"key-phrase":"rural protection","score":0.2360810637},{"key-phrase":"spatial configuration","score":0.1530713886},{"key-phrase":"ecological function","score":0.1464380622},{"key-phrase":"other area","score":0.1400925517},{"key-phrase":"new model","score":0.1214266047},{"key-phrase":"fit values","score":0.1198683232},{"key-phrase":"multiple transition","score":0.1157385409},{"key-phrase":"subclass","score":0.1037419662},{"key-phrase":"multiple law","score":0.1024013758},{"key-phrase":"important example","score":0.0770788193},{"key-phrase":"key point","score":0.0261111706},{"key-phrase":"same time","score":0.0212835781},{"key-phrase":"main pathway","score":0.0180705339},{"key-phrase":"satisfactory goodness","score":-0.0453388169}]},{"Cluster":13,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":427,"Cited by":17.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Progressively Expanded Neural Network (PEN Net) for hyperspectral image classification: A new neural network paradigm for remote sensing image analysis","Abstract":"Hyperspectral image (HSI) has been used for a wide range of applications including forestry, urban planning, and precision agriculture. In recent years, machine learning based algorithms, such as support vector machines, decision trees, ensemble learning, and their variations have shown promising results in HSI analysis. Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to insufficient information abstraction in interpreting hyperspectral pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based classification algorithm, named Progressively Expanded Neural Network (PEN Net), that can effectively interpret hyperspectral pixels in nonlinear feature spaces and then determine their categories. Furthermore, a spectral-spatial HSI classification framework is also introduced to test the generality and robustness of the PEN Net. Experimental results on four standard hyperspectral datasets illustrate that: (1) PEN Net classifier yields better accuracy and competitive processing speed in HSI classification tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods; (2) Multi-hidden layer based PEN Net generally provides better performance than single hidden layer one; (3) Combination of spectral and spatial features in the PEN Net classifier can significantly improve the classification accuracy by 6\u201315% compared to the spectral only based HSI classification.

This study bridges in-situ observations of pedestrian activity and urban computing by integrating high-resolution, large-scale, and heterogeneous urban datasets and analyzing both fixed attributes of the urban landscape (e.g. physical and transit infrastructure) with dynamic environmental and socio-psychological factors, such as weather, air quality, and perceived crime risk. We use local pedestrian count data collected by the New York City (NYC) Department of Transportation (DOT) and an extensive array of open datasets from NYC to test how pedestrian volumes relate to land use, building density, streetscape quality, transportation infrastructure, and other factors typically associated with urban walkability. We quantify, classify, and analyze place dynamics, including contextual and situational factors that influence pedestrian activity at high spatial\u2013temporal resolution. The quantification process measures the urban context by extracting rich, yet initially fragmented and siloed, urban data for individual geolocations. Based on these features, we then construct contextual indicators by selecting and combining features relevant to pedestrian activity, and develop a typology of place to support the generalizability of our analysis. Finally, we use multivariate regression models with panel-corrected standard errors to estimate how specific contextual features and time-varying situational indicators impact pedestrian activity across time of day, day of the week, season, and year. The results provide insights into the key drivers of local pedestrian activity and highlight the importance accounting for the immediate urban environment and socio-spatial dynamics in pedestrian behavior modeling. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Pedestrian mobility; Urban computing; Urban data; Urban planning; Walkability","Authors":"Lai Y., Kontokosta C.E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.018","x":6.66,"y":-3.8,"KeyPhrases":["pedestrian behavior modeling","heterogeneous urban datasets","crime risk","urban walkability","contextual indicator"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"pedestrian behavior modeling","score":0.600394845},{"key-phrase":"local pedestrian activity","score":0.5976219177},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous urban datasets","score":0.5752281547},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian behavior","score":0.5694210529},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian activity","score":0.5691527128},{"key-phrase":"urban walkability","score":0.5678912401},{"key-phrase":"urban data","score":0.537661612},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian volume","score":0.5299783945},{"key-phrase":"local pedestrian count","score":0.5227931738},{"key-phrase":"immediate urban environment","score":0.4710001647},{"key-phrase":"urban computing","score":0.4667294025},{"key-phrase":"urban context","score":0.449554801},{"key-phrase":"urban landscape","score":0.4424959719},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian","score":0.4236822128},{"key-phrase":"city planning","score":0.3962238431},{"key-phrase":"streetscape quality","score":0.3791159987},{"key-phrase":"NYC","score":0.363044858},{"key-phrase":"crime risk","score":0.3605216742},{"key-phrase":"transit infrastructure","score":0.2917488813},{"key-phrase":"spatial dynamic","score":0.2913669348},{"key-phrase":"individual geolocations","score":0.2891100645},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.2714185119},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.2684222758},{"key-phrase":"multivariate regression model","score":0.2632849216},{"key-phrase":"air quality","score":0.2527182698},{"key-phrase":"specific contextual feature","score":0.2508092821},{"key-phrase":"open datasets","score":0.2479864508},{"key-phrase":"contextual indicator","score":0.2439836264},{"key-phrase":"transportation infrastructure","score":0.2412545681},{"key-phrase":"study bridges","score":0.220419839},{"key-phrase":"public health","score":0.1930622309},{"key-phrase":"situational indicator impact","score":0.1888229549},{"key-phrase":"contextual and situational factor","score":0.179893434},{"key-phrase":"emergency response","score":0.1603093147},{"key-phrase":"many aspect","score":0.1554893553},{"key-phrase":"quantification process","score":0.1440189183},{"key-phrase":"temporal resolution","score":0.1405595839},{"key-phrase":"economic development","score":0.128139317},{"key-phrase":"psychological factor","score":0.1205592901},{"key-phrase":"importance accounting","score":0.1098446101},{"key-phrase":"situ observation","score":0.100853458},{"key-phrase":"other factor","score":0.0991506279},{"key-phrase":"extensive array","score":0.0940115899},{"key-phrase":"standard error","score":0.0908003524},{"key-phrase":"key driver","score":-0.0139899123}]},{"Cluster":9,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":429,"Cited by":122.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Measuring human perceptions of a large-scale urban region using machine learning","Abstract":"Measuring the human sense of place and quantifying the connections among the visual features of the built environment that impact the human sense of place have long been of interest to a wide variety of fields. Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Built environment; Deep learning; Place semantics; Street-level imagery; Urban perception","Authors":"Zhang F., Zhou B., Liu L., Liu Y., Fung H.H., Lin H., Ratti C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2018.08.020","x":7.18,"y":-4.79,"KeyPhrases":["place sentiment","deep learning model","street view image","large-scale urban region","wide human perception"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"place sentiment","score":0.523095727},{"key-phrase":"deep learning model","score":0.45361799},{"key-phrase":"large-scale urban region","score":0.4528705478},{"key-phrase":"street view image","score":0.4301100373},{"key-phrase":"human perception","score":0.4036185145},{"key-phrase":"wide human perception","score":0.3970070481},{"key-phrase":"new urban region","score":0.3907737732},{"key-phrase":"human sense","score":0.3810998797},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3587867022},{"key-phrase":"level imagery","score":0.3263248801},{"key-phrase":"place","score":0.3243636489},{"key-phrase":"machine learning approach","score":0.3140007854},{"key-phrase":"visual feature","score":0.3001275063},{"key-phrase":"human perceptual indicator","score":0.2988115549},{"key-phrase":"human rating","score":0.2830109},{"key-phrase":"perceptual indicator","score":0.2555276752},{"key-phrase":"object category","score":0.2440286577},{"key-phrase":"high accuracy rate","score":0.2260951251},{"key-phrase":"different perception","score":0.2109307945},{"key-phrase":"visual element","score":0.1754393131},{"key-phrase":"flexible spatial resolution","score":0.1647769958},{"key-phrase":"statistical analysis","score":0.1486373842},{"key-phrase":"wide variety","score":0.1428492218},{"key-phrase":"human","score":0.1350798458},{"key-phrase":"low-throughput survey","score":0.1265117526},{"key-phrase":"various object","score":0.1163040698},{"key-phrase":"limited data source","score":0.1106315255},{"key-phrase":"Previous study","score":0.0290244091}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":430,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Mining large-scale human mobility data for long-term crime prediction","Abstract":"Traditional crime prediction models based on census data are limited, as they fail to capture the complexity and dynamics of human activity. With the rise of ubiquitous computing, there is the opportunity to improve such models with data that make for better proxies of human presence in cities. In this paper, we leverage large human mobility data to craft an extensive set of features for crime prediction, as informed by theories in criminology and urban studies. We employ averaging and boosting ensemble techniques from machine learning, to investigate their power in predicting yearly counts for different types of crimes occurring in New York City at census tract level. Our study shows that spatial and spatio-temporal features derived from Foursquare venues and checkins, subway rides, and taxi rides, improve the baseline models relying on census and POI data. The proposed models achieve absolute R2 metrics of up to 65% (on a geographical out-of-sample test set) and up to 89% (on a temporal out-of-sample test set). This proves that, next to the residential population of an area, the ambient population there is strongly predictive of the area\u2019s crime levels. We deep-dive into the main crime categories, and find that the predictive gain of the human dynamics features varies across crime types: such features bring the biggest boost in case of grand larcenies, whereas assaults are already well predicted by the census features. Furthermore, we identify and discuss top predictive features for the main crime categories. These results offer valuable insights for those responsible for urban policy or law enforcement. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s).","Author Keywords":"Applied machine learning; Crime prediction; Human mobility; Location-based social networks; Spatio-temporal data; Urban computing","Authors":"Kadar C., Pletikosa I.","DOI":"10.1140\/epjds\/s13688-018-0150-z","x":5.92,"y":-3.07,"KeyPhrases":["crime prediction","large human mobility data","ensemble technique","Foursquare venue","spatio-temporal feature"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"crime prediction","score":0.7175188065},{"key-phrase":"Traditional crime prediction","score":0.6786188483},{"key-phrase":"large human mobility data","score":0.527145505},{"key-phrase":"census feature","score":0.4875456095},{"key-phrase":"crime level","score":0.429842025},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3919482827},{"key-phrase":"main crime category","score":0.3907259703},{"key-phrase":"top predictive feature","score":0.3791014552},{"key-phrase":"crime type","score":0.3781730533},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.3735653758},{"key-phrase":"crime","score":0.3735473454},{"key-phrase":"census data","score":0.3712050915},{"key-phrase":"census","score":0.3686491549},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal feature","score":0.340967834},{"key-phrase":"human dynamic feature","score":0.3273596168},{"key-phrase":"POI data","score":0.3113739789},{"key-phrase":"urban policy","score":0.3092266619},{"key-phrase":"geographical out","score":0.2946066856},{"key-phrase":"taxi ride","score":0.2936223149},{"key-phrase":"residential population","score":0.2849529386},{"key-phrase":"law enforcement","score":0.2686876059},{"key-phrase":"ensemble technique","score":0.2648788691},{"key-phrase":"Foursquare venue","score":0.2610914111},{"key-phrase":"ambient population","score":0.2573866844},{"key-phrase":"subway ride","score":0.2453130633},{"key-phrase":"predictive gain","score":0.2368149757},{"key-phrase":"census tract level","score":0.2353141755},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.2334870994},{"key-phrase":"yearly count","score":0.2159777284},{"key-phrase":"grand larceny","score":0.2111413479},{"key-phrase":"human presence","score":0.2092772722},{"key-phrase":"such feature","score":0.2058772743},{"key-phrase":"baseline model","score":0.2030120641},{"key-phrase":"ubiquitous computing","score":0.1933100969},{"key-phrase":"human activity","score":0.1931070685},{"key-phrase":"such model","score":0.1484638155},{"key-phrase":"valuable insight","score":0.1297851205},{"key-phrase":"extensive set","score":0.1180738285},{"key-phrase":"temporal out","score":0.1094962358},{"key-phrase":"absolute R2 metric","score":0.105263561},{"key-phrase":"sample test set","score":0.0900888592},{"key-phrase":"different type","score":0.0895399824}]},{"Cluster":21,"Score":0.8613670192,"DocId":431,"Cited by":10.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Investigating important urban characteristics in the formation of urban heat islands: a machine learning approach","Abstract":"Despite the urban heat islands phenomenon has long been recognized as a major urban environmental problem, it was not until recently that this urban phenomenon gained attention from the discipline of urban planning.

Current approaches are mostly data-driven, based on machine learning approaches. However, machine learning models require substantial training data and cannot explain the reasoning procedure. Data-driven approaches also fall short while interpreting trajectories where ground truth information is limited. Therefore, this paper develops a novel knowledge-based approach for interpreting smartphone global positioning system trajectories by detecting various transport modes used during travel. The proposed model is based on an expert system that can work without any training, based solely on expert knowledge. Core is a fuzzy multiple-input multiple-output expert system using kinematic and spatial information with a well explained fuzzy reasoning scheme through a fuzzy rule base. The model can provide alternate predictions with varied certainty factors. Different membership function combinations have been evaluated in terms of accuracy and ambiguity, and the result demonstrates that the model performs best using a Gaussian\u2013Gaussian combination, comparable to the existing machine learning approaches. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"Activity; expert system; fuzzy logic; GPS; mobility; smartphone; trajectory; transport mode; travel; uncertainty","Authors":"Das R.D., Winter S.","DOI":"10.1080\/15472450.2018.1436968","x":5.84,"y":-1.92,"KeyPhrases":["intelligent transportation system","fuzzy rule base","aware mobile computing","Gaussian combination","spatial information"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"intelligent transportation system","score":0.5647416115},{"key-phrase":"fuzzy reasoning scheme","score":0.4704511762},{"key-phrase":"expert system","score":0.446670711},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.4398177862},{"key-phrase":"Transport mode detection","score":0.418925941},{"key-phrase":"fuzzy rule base","score":0.4182232022},{"key-phrase":"machine learning approach","score":0.4169200063},{"key-phrase":"global positioning system","score":0.4103520513},{"key-phrase":"spatial information","score":0.3472514153},{"key-phrase":"aware mobile computing","score":0.3385346532},{"key-phrase":"various transport mode","score":0.3315876722},{"key-phrase":"expert knowledge","score":0.2981767058},{"key-phrase":"ground truth information","score":0.2696992755},{"key-phrase":"alternate prediction","score":0.2618972063},{"key-phrase":"multiple-output expert","score":0.2531545758},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2329903841},{"key-phrase":"fuzzy","score":0.2242965102},{"key-phrase":"reasoning procedure","score":0.2189457715},{"key-phrase":"substantial training data","score":0.1818987578},{"key-phrase":"Gaussian combination","score":0.1672806144},{"key-phrase":"varied certainty factor","score":0.1597285569},{"key-phrase":"research area","score":0.1570244133},{"key-phrase":"novel knowledge","score":0.1551749557},{"key-phrase":"reasoning","score":0.1287080646},{"key-phrase":"different domain","score":0.0939078182},{"key-phrase":"Different membership function","score":0.0240834467},{"key-phrase":"Current approach","score":0.0121213142}]},{"Cluster":4,"Score":0.781378981,"DocId":434,"Cited by":40.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Citizen-centered big data analysis-driven governance intelligence framework for smart cities","Abstract":"Sensors and systems within rapidly expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Citizen persona; Citizen profile; Citizen-centered big data; Data merging; Data-analysis algorithm; Governance intelligence; Ontology model; Smart cities","Authors":"Ju J., Liu L., Feng Y.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.telpol.2018.01.003","x":6.8,"y":-2.47,"KeyPhrases":["collaborative urban governance","big data","smart city","citizen profile","Bayesian Net technique"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"collaborative urban governance","score":0.5590457916},{"key-phrase":"smart city","score":0.5585484505},{"key-phrase":"urban governance","score":0.5474495888},{"key-phrase":"urban governance issue","score":0.5342338085},{"key-phrase":"urban governance decision","score":0.5322496891},{"key-phrase":"governance intelligence","score":0.524353981},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.4797190428},{"key-phrase":"urban public service delivery","score":0.448549509},{"key-phrase":"big data analysis","score":0.4417442083},{"key-phrase":"citizen participation","score":0.3651551902},{"key-phrase":"data mining","score":0.3541069627},{"key-phrase":"citizen profile","score":0.3440575302},{"key-phrase":"decision research","score":0.3283339143},{"key-phrase":"citizen persona","score":0.3053236008},{"key-phrase":"governance decision","score":0.3033807874},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2789813876},{"key-phrase":"citizen","score":0.2709682882},{"key-phrase":"blood donation governance","score":0.2696811557},{"key-phrase":"discovery layer","score":0.2695761323},{"key-phrase":"ontology model","score":0.265794456},{"key-phrase":"such data","score":0.2276875973},{"key-phrase":"Bayesian Net technique","score":0.205940932},{"key-phrase":"similarity calculation","score":0.1981802881},{"key-phrase":"conflict resolution","score":0.1871810853},{"key-phrase":"analysis algorithms","score":0.1814482808},{"key-phrase":"econometrics method","score":0.1757223904},{"key-phrase":"panoramic data","score":0.1589398086},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1520370543},{"key-phrase":"simple statistical analysis technique","score":0.1361391395},{"key-phrase":"analytical algorithms","score":0.1316413283},{"key-phrase":"group level","score":0.1177980006},{"key-phrase":"multiple source","score":0.1126625165},{"key-phrase":"multiple disciplinaries","score":0.103181839},{"key-phrase":"extant conceptual study","score":0.0842766613},{"key-phrase":"potential value","score":0.0572418831},{"key-phrase":"specific path","score":0.0571919233},{"key-phrase":"further operational study","score":0.0293517075},{"key-phrase":"mutual supplement cross","score":0.0127339326},{"key-phrase":"centered","score":0.0066610947}]},{"Cluster":7,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":435,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Knowledge-based learning for solving vehicle routing problem","Abstract":"In this study, we have developed a method that applies machine learning in combination with an optimization heuristic algorithm such as a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Further, we developed a knowledge-based algorithm for a knowledge learning system. The algorithm learns to classify coordinates (unlabeled) into regions. Consequently, dividing routing calculations into regions (clusters) provides many benefits over traditional methods, and can result in an improvement in routing cost over the traditional company method by up to 25.68% and over the classical GA by up to 8.10%.

Previous studies have generally integrated traditional machine learning with cellular automaton (CA) models to simulate urban development. Nevertheless, difficulties still exist in the process of obtaining more accurate results with CA models; such difficulties are mainly due to the insufficient consideration of neighborhood effects during urban transition rule mining. In this paper, we used an effective deep learning method, named convolution neural network for united mining (UMCNN), to solve the problem. UMCNN has substantial potential to get neighborhood information from its receptive field. Thus, a novel CA model coupled with UMCNN and Markov chain was designed to improve the performance of simulating urban expansion processes. Choosing the Pearl River Delta of China as the study area, we excavate the driving factors and the transformational relations revealed by the urban land-use patterns in 2000, 2005 and 2010 and further simulate the urban expansion status in 2020 and 2030. Additionally, three traditional machine-learning-based CA models (LR, ANN and RFA) are built to attest the practicality of the proposed model. In the comparison, the proposed method reaches the highest simulation accuracy and landscape index similarity. The predicted urban expansion results reveal that the economy will continue to be the primary factor in the study area from 2010 to 2030. The proposed model can serve as guidance in urban planning and government decision-making. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"cellular automata; deep learning; large scale; Markov chain; Urban expansion","Authors":"He J., Li X., Yao Y., Hong Y., Jinbao Z.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2018.1480783","x":8.75,"y":-3.06,"KeyPhrases":["urban expansion process","effective deep learning method","cellular automaton","landscape index similarity","Pearl River Delta"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban expansion process","score":0.5267113447},{"key-phrase":"urban transition rule","score":0.5075558424},{"key-phrase":"urbanization process","score":0.5027770996},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4772996604},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion status","score":0.475998342},{"key-phrase":"urban development","score":0.4543814659},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion","score":0.4389441311},{"key-phrase":"urban land","score":0.4343360364},{"key-phrase":"cellular automaton","score":0.4245174825},{"key-phrase":"effective deep learning method","score":0.3391472101},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.3355893791},{"key-phrase":"economic and urban issue","score":0.3285656869},{"key-phrase":"landscape index similarity","score":0.2897153497},{"key-phrase":"traditional machine learning","score":0.2763566673},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood effect","score":0.2392062694},{"key-phrase":"future pattern","score":0.2260633558},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood information","score":0.220140323},{"key-phrase":"receptive field","score":0.2199867666},{"key-phrase":"UMCNN","score":0.1908395886},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1849498302},{"key-phrase":"use pattern","score":0.1787603796},{"key-phrase":"Markov chain","score":0.1783177257},{"key-phrase":"novel CA model","score":0.1753100604},{"key-phrase":"CA model","score":0.1731552482},{"key-phrase":"Pearl River Delta","score":0.1705522239},{"key-phrase":"simulation accuracy","score":0.1497410238},{"key-phrase":"transformational relation","score":0.1127948388},{"key-phrase":"united mining","score":0.1037506238},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0922582448},{"key-phrase":"accurate result","score":0.0916075483},{"key-phrase":"Previous study","score":0.0456069112},{"key-phrase":"CA","score":0.0431741476},{"key-phrase":"primary factor","score":0.0381395333},{"key-phrase":"government decision","score":0.0274187084},{"key-phrase":"traditional machine","score":0.0229153708},{"key-phrase":"such difficulty","score":-0.0132829268},{"key-phrase":"great importance","score":-0.0232760441},{"key-phrase":"insufficient consideration","score":-0.0459864289}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":437,"Cited by":12.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Ultra-Light aircraft-based hyperspectral and colour-infrared imaging to identify deciduous tree species in an urban environment","Abstract":"One may consider the application of remote sensing as a trade-off between the imaging platforms, sensors, and data gathering and processing techniques. This study addresses the potential of hyperspectral imaging using ultra-light aircraft for vegetation species mapping in an urban environment, exploring both the engineering and scientific aspects related to imaging platform design and image classification methods. An imaging system based on simultaneous use of Rikola frame format hyperspectral and Nikon D800E adopted colour infrared cameras installed onboard a Bekas X32 manned ultra-light aircraft is introduced. Two test imaging flight missions were conducted in July of 2015 and September of 2016 over a 4000 ha area in Kaunas City, Lithuania. Sixteen and 64 spectral bands in 2015 and 2016, respectively, in a spectral range of 500-900 nm were recorded with colour infrared images. Three research questions were explored assessing the identification of six deciduous tree species: (1) Pre-treatment of spectral features for classification, (2) testing five conventional machine learning classifiers, and (3) fusion of hyperspectral and colour infrared images. Classification performance was assessed by applying leave-one-out cross-validation at the individual crown level and using as a reference at least 100 field inventoried trees for each species. The best-performing classification algorithm-multilayer perceptron, using all spectral properties extracted from the hyperspectral images-resulted in a moderate classification accuracy. The overall classification accuracy was 63%, Cohen's Kappa was 0.54, and the species-specific classification accuracies were in the range of 51-72%. Hyperspectral images resulted in significantly better tree species classification ability than the colour infrared images and simultaneous use of spectral properties extracted from hyperspectral and colour infrared images improved slightly the accuracy over the 2015 image. Even though classifications using hyperspectral data cubes of 64 bands resulted in relatively larger accuracies than with 16 bands, classification error matrices were not statistically different. Alternative imaging platforms (like an unmanned aerial vehicle and a Cessna 172 aircraft) and settings of the flights were discussed using simulated imaging projects assuming the same study area and field of application. Ultra-light aircraft-based hyperspectral and colour-infrared imaging was considered to be a technically and economically sound solution for urban green space inventories to facilitate tree mapping, characterization, and monitoring. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Classification; Colour infrared; Hyperspectral; Ultra-light aircraft; Urban trees","Authors":"Mozgeris G., Juodkiene V., Jonikavi\u010dius D., Straigyte L., Gadal S., Ouerghemmi W.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs10101668","x":9.81,"y":-4.68,"KeyPhrases":["hyperspectral images","tree specie classification","unmanned aerial vehicle","vegetation specie mapping","Kaunas City"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"hyperspectral images","score":0.6182765961},{"key-phrase":"Hyperspectral image","score":0.6009249687},{"key-phrase":"hyperspectral","score":0.593636632},{"key-phrase":"vegetation specie mapping","score":0.5872455835},{"key-phrase":"hyperspectral imaging","score":0.5521214008},{"key-phrase":"tree specie classification","score":0.5503101945},{"key-phrase":"hyperspectral data cube","score":0.4847207069},{"key-phrase":"deciduous tree specie","score":0.434279561},{"key-phrase":"colour infrared image","score":0.4294825792},{"key-phrase":"image classification method","score":0.4217161834},{"key-phrase":"infrared image","score":0.4076988101},{"key-phrase":"infrared camera","score":0.3990750015},{"key-phrase":"infrared imaging","score":0.3861664832},{"key-phrase":"classification algorithm","score":0.3654639125},{"key-phrase":"spectral feature","score":0.3579359651},{"key-phrase":"specific classification accuracy","score":0.3199853897},{"key-phrase":"Classification performance","score":0.3169700205},{"key-phrase":"urban green space inventory","score":0.3083239496},{"key-phrase":"test imaging flight","score":0.2969784141},{"key-phrase":"classification error matrix","score":0.2915135622},{"key-phrase":"overall classification accuracy","score":0.2810436487},{"key-phrase":"spectral band","score":0.271900475},{"key-phrase":"spectral range","score":0.2625082135},{"key-phrase":"multilayer perceptron","score":0.2574371696},{"key-phrase":"moderate classification accuracy","score":0.2567386031},{"key-phrase":"tree mapping","score":0.2504754663},{"key-phrase":"unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.2457406521},{"key-phrase":"imaging system","score":0.2359443754},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.2300823927},{"key-phrase":"simulated imaging project","score":0.2280754596},{"key-phrase":"imaging platform design","score":0.2262712419},{"key-phrase":"manned ultra-light aircraft","score":0.2098258734},{"key-phrase":"imaging platform","score":0.2012779713},{"key-phrase":"ultra-light aircraft","score":0.2007620931},{"key-phrase":"Alternative imaging platform","score":0.1662016809},{"key-phrase":"Nikon D800E","score":0.1554727256},{"key-phrase":"colour","score":0.1514460444},{"key-phrase":"spectral property","score":0.1411610246},{"key-phrase":"data gathering","score":0.1390530765},{"key-phrase":"scientific aspect","score":0.1266119778},{"key-phrase":"Cohen's Kappa","score":0.1102139875},{"key-phrase":"Bekas X32","score":0.107754305},{"key-phrase":"Kaunas City","score":0.1025619805},{"key-phrase":"processing technique","score":0.1016338468},{"key-phrase":"individual crown level","score":0.0684960932},{"key-phrase":"same study area","score":0.0681593716},{"key-phrase":"Rikola frame format","score":0.0395949855},{"key-phrase":"research question","score":0.0258049853},{"key-phrase":"simultaneous use","score":0.0151585583},{"key-phrase":"conventional machine","score":-0.013587622},{"key-phrase":"sound solution","score":-0.0295812674}]},{"Cluster":6,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":438,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Game-based crowdsourcing to support collaborative customization of the definition of sustainability","Abstract":"Successful adoption and management of sustainable urban systems hinges on the community embracing these systems. Capturing citizens\u2019 ideas, views, and assessments of the built environment will be essential to this goal. In collaborative city planning, these are qualified and valued forms of partial knowledge that should be collectively used to shape the decision making process of urban planning. Among other tools, social media and online social network analytics can provide means to capture elements of such a distributed knowledge. While a structured definition of sustainability (normally dictated in a top-down fashion) may not sufficiently respond well to the pluralist nature of such knowledge acquisition; dealing with the unstructured community inputs, assessments and contributions on social media can be confusing. We can detect fully relevant topics\/ideas in community discussions; but they typically suffer from lack of coherence. In this paper, we advocate the use of a semi-structured approach for capturing, analyzing, and interpreting citizens\u2019 inputs. Public officials and professionals can develop the main elements (topical aspects) of sustainability, which can act as the skeleton of a taxonomy. It is however, the community inputs\/ideas (in our case collected via social media and parsed), that can shape-up that skeleton and augment those topical aspects with adding the required semantic depth. In more specific terms, we collected tweets for four urban infrastructure mega-projects in North America. Then we used a game-with-a-purpose to crowdsource the identification of topics for a training set of tweets. This was then used to train machine learning algorithms to cluster the rest of collected tweets. We studied the semantic (finding the topics) of tweets as well as their sentiment (in terms of being opposing or supportive of a project). Our classification tested different decision trees with different topic hierarchies. We considered\/extracted eight different linguistic features in studying contents of a tweet. Finally, we examined the accuracy of three algorithms in classifying tweets according to the sequence in the tree, and based on the extracted features. These are: K-nearest neighbors, Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Respective to our data set, SVM outperformed other algorithms. Semantic analysis was insensitive to the depth\/number of linguistic features considered. In contrast, sentiment analysis was enhanced when part of speech (PoS) was tracked. Interestingly, our work shows that considering the topic (semantic) of a tweet helped enhance the accuracy of sentiment analysis: including topical class as a feature in conducting sentiment analysis results in higher accuracies. This could be used as means to detect the evolution of community opinion: that topic-based social networks are evolving within the communities tweeting about urban projects. It could also be used to identify the topics of top priority to the community or the ones that have the widest spread of views. In our case, these were mainly the impacts of the design and engineering features on social issues. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Computational linguistic; Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Social media; Sustainability; Urban infrastructure","Authors":"Nik Bakht M., El-Diraby T.E., Hossaini M.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.aei.2018.08.019","x":6.68,"y":-2.88,"KeyPhrases":["unstructured community input","sustainable urban system","Na\u00efve Bayes classifier","tweet","Semantic analysis"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"unstructured community input","score":0.5014369488},{"key-phrase":"sentiment analysis","score":0.4504407048},{"key-phrase":"sustainable urban system","score":0.4334444404},{"key-phrase":"collaborative city planning","score":0.4305528998},{"key-phrase":"Semantic analysis","score":0.4263024926},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4145485163},{"key-phrase":"community discussion","score":0.3760599494},{"key-phrase":"urban infrastructure mega-projects","score":0.3693503737},{"key-phrase":"urban project","score":0.3594727516},{"key-phrase":"sentiment","score":0.3590826392},{"key-phrase":"community inputs","score":0.3416122198},{"key-phrase":"online social network analytics","score":0.3214914203},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machines","score":0.3190015256},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3181596398},{"key-phrase":"community opinion","score":0.3137748241},{"key-phrase":"different topic hierarchy","score":0.2952414751},{"key-phrase":"social medium","score":0.2930968404},{"key-phrase":"social network","score":0.2764824629},{"key-phrase":"semantic depth","score":0.2692567706},{"key-phrase":"Na\u00efve Bayes classifier","score":0.2655260563},{"key-phrase":"linguistic feature","score":0.2549676001},{"key-phrase":"topical class","score":0.2479071617},{"key-phrase":"such knowledge acquisition","score":0.2417135835},{"key-phrase":"social issue","score":0.2403335273},{"key-phrase":"tweet","score":0.2399919182},{"key-phrase":"pluralist nature","score":0.2345644832},{"key-phrase":"relevant topics","score":0.2287659645},{"key-phrase":"topical aspect","score":0.2275451124},{"key-phrase":"different decision tree","score":0.19666031},{"key-phrase":"different linguistic feature","score":0.1963338852},{"key-phrase":"Public official","score":0.1808904111},{"key-phrase":"engineering feature","score":0.1781595349},{"key-phrase":"training set","score":0.1751068234},{"key-phrase":"other algorithms","score":0.1719855666},{"key-phrase":"partial knowledge","score":0.1676917672},{"key-phrase":"structured definition","score":0.1446618438},{"key-phrase":"semi-structured approach","score":0.1420860589},{"key-phrase":"main element","score":0.1099884436},{"key-phrase":"top priority","score":0.1021378562},{"key-phrase":"specific term","score":0.0866218805},{"key-phrase":"other tool","score":0.0776623264},{"key-phrase":"Successful adoption","score":0.0565464497},{"key-phrase":"North America","score":0.0249603391},{"key-phrase":"top-down fashion","score":0.0158688128}]},{"Cluster":3,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":439,"Cited by":22.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Urban traffic flow analysis based on deep learning car detection from cctv image series","Abstract":"Traffic flow analysis is fundamental for urban planning and management of road traffic infrastructure.

Results show that the fine-tuned MobileNet model with 98.2% precision, 58.5% recall and 73.4% harmonic mean could potentially be used for a real time traffic monitoring application with big data, due to its fast performance.

As a result, significant efforts have been put forth to develop methods that can accurately model and characterize building energy consumption in cities. These models aim to utilize physics-based building energy simulations, reduced-order calculations and statistical learning methods to assess the energy performance of buildings within a dense urban area. However, current urban building energy models are limited in their ability to account for the inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors that can have a substantial impact on building energy use. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation (DUE-S) framework that integrates a network-based machine learning algorithm (ResNet) with engineering simulation to better understand how buildings consume energy on multiple temporal (hourly, daily, monthly) and spatial scales in a city (single building, block, urban). We validate the proposed DUE-S framework on a proof of concept case study of 22 densely located university buildings in California, USA. Our results indicate that the DUE-S framework is able to accurately predict urban scale energy consumption at hourly, daily and monthly intervals. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the integration of data-driven and engineering simulation approaches can partially capture the inter-building energy dynamics and impacts of the urban context and merits future work to explore how they can be improved to predict sub-urban scale energy predictions (single building, block). In the end, successfully predicting and modeling the energy performance of urban buildings has the potential to inform the decision-making of a wide variety of urban sustainability stakeholders including architects, engineers and policymakers. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Building energy; Data-driven; Machine learning; Multi-scale; Simulation; Urban context; Urban energy modeling","Authors":"Nutkiewicz A., Yang Z., Jain R.K.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apenergy.2018.05.023","x":4.0799999237,"y":4.0100002289,"KeyPhrases":["Urban Energy Simulation","statistical learning method","university building","building energy consumption","S framework"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Urban Energy Simulation","score":0.6920162439},{"key-phrase":"current urban building energy","score":0.6528251767},{"key-phrase":"building energy simulation","score":0.6148824692},{"key-phrase":"building energy consumption","score":0.5861355066},{"key-phrase":"sub-urban scale energy","score":0.5798581243},{"key-phrase":"urban scale energy","score":0.5755008459},{"key-phrase":"inter-building energy dynamic","score":0.5382657647},{"key-phrase":"urban building","score":0.425259769},{"key-phrase":"urban microclimate factor","score":0.4146803319},{"key-phrase":"world's energy consumption","score":0.4040480852},{"key-phrase":"energy use","score":0.3804174662},{"key-phrase":"dense urban area","score":0.3521592915},{"key-phrase":"urban sustainability stakeholder","score":0.3226718605},{"key-phrase":"energy performance","score":0.3205001354},{"key-phrase":"engineering simulation","score":0.3195913136},{"key-phrase":"engineering simulation approach","score":0.3065431714},{"key-phrase":"urban context","score":0.3036043048},{"key-phrase":"university building","score":0.2861551344},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.2738436759},{"key-phrase":"single building","score":0.2445680201},{"key-phrase":"statistical learning method","score":0.2226469517},{"key-phrase":"environmental emission","score":0.1889395267},{"key-phrase":"S framework","score":0.184081018},{"key-phrase":"energy","score":0.1824126989},{"key-phrase":"concept case study","score":0.1610225439},{"key-phrase":"novel Data","score":0.1349770129},{"key-phrase":"spatial scale","score":0.1003336236},{"key-phrase":"daily and monthly interval","score":0.067124024},{"key-phrase":"order calculation","score":0.0560992472},{"key-phrase":"merit future work","score":0.0400977656},{"key-phrase":"DUE","score":0.0361979753},{"key-phrase":"model aim","score":0.0164657868},{"key-phrase":"substantial impact","score":0.0076366351},{"key-phrase":"significant effort","score":-0.0199752897},{"key-phrase":"wide variety","score":-0.0675178021}]},{"Cluster":31,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":442,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Comparison of Regression Tools for Regional Electric Load Forecasting","Abstract":"Urban area electrical load forecasting is important for power generation capacity planning and also to integrate environment friendly energy sources at district level. Load predictions will help in developing demand side management in coordination with renewable power generation. Urban area load is influenced by meteorological conditions therefore it is important to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively contribute for electrical load predictions. The most commonly used algorithm for load prediction is Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a complex predictor that utilizes a big amount of training data. k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) has proven to be efficient by the introduction of binary dummy variables for categorisation and it can be used for short term(30 min) and long term(24 hours) load forecasting. This paper explores the use of regression tool for regional electric load forecasting by correlating lower distinctive categorical level (season and day of the week) and weather parameters. The historical electrical load datasets with meteorological parameters are available for the Sydney region and they have been used to test the regression tools. Data correlation over seasonal changes have been argued by means of improving Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE). By examining the structure of various regressors they are compared for the lowest MAPE. The regressors show good MAPE for short term (30 min) prediction and Random Forest Regressor scores best in the range of 1-2 % MAPE. \u00a9 2018 University of Split, FESB.","Author Keywords":"Electric Load Forecasting; k-NN; Machine Learning; Regression Tools","Authors":"Johannesen N.J., Kolhe M., Goodwin M.","DOI":null,"x":3.7799999714,"y":4.1399998665,"KeyPhrases":["regional electric load forecasting","Random Forest Regressor","Neural Network","weather parameter","friendly energy source"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"regional electric load forecasting","score":0.7347813845},{"key-phrase":"electrical load forecasting","score":0.7188924551},{"key-phrase":"load forecasting","score":0.6629474163},{"key-phrase":"electrical load prediction","score":0.6436989307},{"key-phrase":"Load prediction","score":0.5577070713},{"key-phrase":"historical electrical load datasets","score":0.4701951146},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest Regressor","score":0.425201714},{"key-phrase":"Urban area load","score":0.4041912258},{"key-phrase":"complex predictor","score":0.3728398383},{"key-phrase":"Neural Network","score":0.361231029},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.3395887911},{"key-phrase":"regression tool","score":0.3319842815},{"key-phrase":"various regressors","score":0.3000352979},{"key-phrase":"weather parameter","score":0.2906355858},{"key-phrase":"meteorological parameter","score":0.2827616334},{"key-phrase":"seasonal change","score":0.269883126},{"key-phrase":"meteorological condition","score":0.2586847544},{"key-phrase":"electrical","score":0.2536317408},{"key-phrase":"renewable power generation","score":0.2381381691},{"key-phrase":"Urban area","score":0.2267465591},{"key-phrase":"power generation capacity","score":0.2198631763},{"key-phrase":"Data correlation","score":0.212654978},{"key-phrase":"demand side management","score":0.195516631},{"key-phrase":"Sydney region","score":0.1933756173},{"key-phrase":"friendly energy source","score":0.1606460661},{"key-phrase":"load","score":0.1425938606},{"key-phrase":"good MAPE","score":0.1212151051},{"key-phrase":"binary dummy variable","score":0.1148328632},{"key-phrase":"district level","score":0.1068358272},{"key-phrase":"short term","score":0.0968875661},{"key-phrase":"distinctive categorical level","score":0.070168972},{"key-phrase":"Mean Absolute Percentage","score":0.0420008525},{"key-phrase":"long term","score":0.0414766669},{"key-phrase":"big amount","score":-0.0234223045}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":443,"Cited by":18.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Road centerline extraction from very-high-resolution aerial image and LiDAR data based on road connectivity","Abstract":"The road networks provide key information for a broad range of applications such as urban planning, urban management, and navigation. The fast-developing technology of remote sensing that acquires high-resolution observational data of the land surface offers opportunities for automatic extraction of road networks. However, the road networks extracted from remote sensing images are likely affected by shadows and trees, making the road map irregular and inaccurate. This research aims to improve the extraction of road centerlines using both very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) by accounting for road connectivity. The proposed method first applies the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA) to segment remote sensing images into image objects and then classifies image objects using the machine learning classifier, random forest. A post-processing approach based on the minimum area bounding rectangle (MABR) is proposed and a structure feature index is adopted to obtain the complete road networks. Finally, a multistep approach, that is, morphology thinning, Harris corner detection, and least square fitting (MHL) approach, is designed to accurately extract the road centerlines from the complex road networks. The proposed method is applied to three datasets, including the New York dataset obtained from the object identification dataset, the Vaihingen dataset obtained from the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 2D semantic labelling benchmark and Guangzhou dataset. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can obtain the highest completeness, correctness, and quality for the three datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is an efficient solution for extracting road centerlines in complex scenes from VHR aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"LiDAR data; Object recognition; Road centerline; Road connectivity; Very-high-resolution image","Authors":"Zhang Z., Zhang X., Sun Y., Zhang P.","DOI":"10.3390\/rs10081284","x":9.22,"y":-5.14,"KeyPhrases":["complex road network","random forest","fractal net evolution","land surface","Guangzhou dataset"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"complex road network","score":0.4906105101},{"key-phrase":"complete road network","score":0.4693666697},{"key-phrase":"road network","score":0.4413831234},{"key-phrase":"road connectivity","score":0.4088867903},{"key-phrase":"fractal net evolution","score":0.3991940022},{"key-phrase":"road centerline","score":0.3822360635},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.3730296493},{"key-phrase":"Guangzhou dataset","score":0.3339287043},{"key-phrase":"Remote Sensing","score":0.3310653567},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3147348166},{"key-phrase":"road","score":0.30518049},{"key-phrase":"object identification dataset","score":0.294829607},{"key-phrase":"morphology thinning","score":0.2804015875},{"key-phrase":"road map","score":0.2662632167},{"key-phrase":"automatic extraction","score":0.2637188137},{"key-phrase":"urban management","score":0.2630267143},{"key-phrase":"structure feature index","score":0.2587140203},{"key-phrase":"aerial image","score":0.2579307854},{"key-phrase":"semantic labelling benchmark","score":0.2546759248},{"key-phrase":"complex scene","score":0.233470276},{"key-phrase":"land surface","score":0.2198490798},{"key-phrase":"centerline","score":0.2088281214},{"key-phrase":"Harris corner detection","score":0.2066949308},{"key-phrase":"Vaihingen dataset","score":0.1908217967},{"key-phrase":"image objects","score":0.1887346655},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution observational data","score":0.1884152889},{"key-phrase":"light detection","score":0.1835196316},{"key-phrase":"image object","score":0.1778499782},{"key-phrase":"New York dataset","score":0.1549075842},{"key-phrase":"square fitting","score":0.1283292621},{"key-phrase":"minimum area","score":0.1239111125},{"key-phrase":"key information","score":0.09774822},{"key-phrase":"art method","score":0.089219749},{"key-phrase":"efficient solution","score":0.068372272},{"key-phrase":"post-processing approach","score":0.0579403639},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0568388477},{"key-phrase":"fast-developing_VBG technology","score":0.0433311015},{"key-phrase":"broad range","score":0.0129730403},{"key-phrase":"multistep approach","score":-0.0107738115},{"key-phrase":"experiment result","score":-0.0353528485},{"key-phrase":"International Society","score":-0.0386327095}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":444,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Context-Based Filtering of Noisy Labels for Automatic Basemap Updating from UAV Data","Abstract":"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to obtain high-resolution aerial imagery at frequent intervals, making them a valuable tool for urban planners who require up-to-date basemaps. Supervised classification methods can be exploited to translate the UAV data into such basemaps. However, these methods require labeled training samples, the collection of which may be complex and time consuming. Existing spatial datasets can be exploited to provide the training labels, but these often contain errors due to differences in the date or resolution of the dataset from which these outdated labels were obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for updating basemaps using global and local contextual cues to automatically remove unreliable samples from the training set, and thereby, improve the classification accuracy. Using UAV datasets over Kigali, Rwanda, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we demonstrate how the amount of mislabeled training samples can be reduced by 44.1% and 35.5%, respectively, leading to a classification accuracy of 92.1% in Kigali and 91.3% in Dar es Salaam. To achieve the same accuracy in Dar es Salaam, between 50000 and 60000 manually labeled image segments would be needed. This demonstrates that the proposed approach of using outdated spatial data to provide labels and iteratively removing unreliable samples is a viable method for obtaining high classification accuracies while reducing the costly step of acquiring labeled training samples. \u00a9 2008-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Basemap updating; image classification; informal settlements; label noise; random forests; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); urban planning","Authors":"Gevaert C.M., Persello C., Elberink S.O., Vosselman G., Sliuzas R.","DOI":"10.1109\/JSTARS.2017.2762905","x":9.4,"y":-5.31,"KeyPhrases":["high-resolution aerial imagery","training label","outdated spatial data","UAV datasets","such basemaps"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"high-resolution aerial imagery","score":0.4941289425},{"key-phrase":"UAV datasets","score":0.4939964414},{"key-phrase":"UAV data","score":0.4218295217},{"key-phrase":"basemaps","score":0.4192829132},{"key-phrase":"outdated spatial data","score":0.4165123999},{"key-phrase":"Unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.4012809992},{"key-phrase":"spatial datasets","score":0.374050945},{"key-phrase":"training label","score":0.3688426614},{"key-phrase":"such basemaps","score":0.3683716655},{"key-phrase":"local contextual cue","score":0.355640173},{"key-phrase":"training sample","score":0.3409023583},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.3375487328},{"key-phrase":"high classification accuracy","score":0.3374181688},{"key-phrase":"date basemaps","score":0.3325077295},{"key-phrase":"training set","score":0.3321536779},{"key-phrase":"classification method","score":0.2929638922},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.2805833519},{"key-phrase":"outdated label","score":0.2422941178},{"key-phrase":"unreliable sample","score":0.2268174887},{"key-phrase":"image segment","score":0.2241363525},{"key-phrase":"same accuracy","score":0.216178149},{"key-phrase":"dar","score":0.1928837895},{"key-phrase":"valuable tool","score":0.1089048907},{"key-phrase":"viable method","score":0.0791468322},{"key-phrase":"frequent interval","score":0.0452582166},{"key-phrase":"costly step","score":0.0372784659}]},{"Cluster":20,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":445,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Deep CNN-based methods to evaluate neighborhood-scale urban valuation through street scenes perception","Abstract":"Social data from city level provides unprecedented opportunities to identify urban attributes from various angles.

However, it is difficult for operators to estimate the location of most commercial UEs because they cannot feedback their location information directly to their serving base stations with the exception of UEs with Minimization of Drive Test (MDT) functions specified in LTE Release 10. Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprint method is known as an effective localization method, with which we can estimate the location of UEs with only RF signature and location information beforehand. In LTE, RF fingerprint database can be collected by conducting drive tests or using measurement data from UEs compatible with MDT. Although the estimation accuracy can be better with more RF signatures, the increase in the amount of RF signatures causes the increase in the feedback, which consumes the uplink capacity and UE battery. Furthermore, keeping all RF signatures in database is inefficient because some RF signatures do not have effect on improving estimation accuracy. Hence, it is important to clarify the effect of each RF signature and use only effective ones in the localization. In this paper, we conducted a field experiment to create an RF fingerprint database in dense urban area, and evaluated the effectiveness of each RF signature by making several localization models based on machine learning. Eventually, we clarified minimum RF signatures required to operate RF fingerprint localization in LTE network. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Localization; LTE; Machine Learning; RF fingerprint","Authors":"Kanazawa N., Nagate A., Yamamoto A.","DOI":"10.1109\/VTCFall.2018.8690868","x":3.75,"y":1.3999999762,"KeyPhrases":["RF fingerprint localization","LTE network","machine learning","location information","several localization model"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"RF fingerprint localization","score":0.6311877966},{"key-phrase":"RF fingerprint database","score":0.564021349},{"key-phrase":"effective localization method","score":0.5065526962},{"key-phrase":"LTE network","score":0.4315845668},{"key-phrase":"fingerprint method","score":0.4224889874},{"key-phrase":"RF signatures","score":0.3999862969},{"key-phrase":"mobile communication network","score":0.3998848796},{"key-phrase":"RF signature","score":0.3849339783},{"key-phrase":"minimum RF signature","score":0.3572281599},{"key-phrase":"only RF signature","score":0.3478263021},{"key-phrase":"several localization model","score":0.3434354067},{"key-phrase":"Radio Frequency","score":0.3232445717},{"key-phrase":"base station","score":0.2990617752},{"key-phrase":"LTE Release","score":0.2863699198},{"key-phrase":"location information","score":0.2841427624},{"key-phrase":"dense urban area","score":0.2607482672},{"key-phrase":"estimation accuracy","score":0.2577020228},{"key-phrase":"network optimization","score":0.2285917401},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2208047211},{"key-phrase":"RF","score":0.2176756859},{"key-phrase":"high accuracy","score":0.2117948383},{"key-phrase":"measurement data","score":0.2113666981},{"key-phrase":"UE battery","score":0.1943906099},{"key-phrase":"signature","score":0.1410205811},{"key-phrase":"uplink capacity","score":0.1371361911},{"key-phrase":"Drive Test","score":0.1364764571},{"key-phrase":"user equipment","score":0.1289502382},{"key-phrase":"efficient cell planning","score":0.1261602938},{"key-phrase":"field experiment","score":0.0944189876},{"key-phrase":"commercial UEs","score":0.0837302953},{"key-phrase":"effective one","score":0.0452121757}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":447,"Cited by":25.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Using a gradient boosting model to improve the performance of low-cost aerosol monitors in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment","Abstract":"The increased availability and improved quality of new sensing technologies have catalyzed a growing body of research to evaluate and leverage these tools in order to quantify and describe urban environments. Air quality, in particular, has received greater attention because of the well-established links to serious respiratory illnesses and the unprecedented levels of air pollution in developed and developing countries and cities around the world. Though numerous laboratory and field evaluation studies have begun to explore the use and potential of low-cost air quality monitoring devices, the performance and stability of these tools has not been adequately evaluated in complex urban environments, and further research is needed. In this study, we present the design of a low-cost air quality monitoring platform based on the Shinyei PPD42 aerosol monitor and examine the suitability of the sensor for deployment in a dense heterogeneous urban environment. We assess the sensor's performance during a field calibration campaign from February 7th to March 25th 2017 with a reference instrument in New York City, and present a novel calibration approach using a machine learning method that incorporates publicly available meteorological data in order to improve overall sensor performance. We find that while the PPD42 performs well in relation to the reference instrument using linear regression (R2 = 0.36\u20130.51), a gradient boosting regression tree model can significantly improve device calibration (R2 = 0.68\u20130.76). We discuss the sensor's performance and reliability when deployed in a dense, heterogeneous urban environment during a period of significant variation in weather conditions, and important considerations when using machine learning techniques to improve the performance of low-cost air quality monitors. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Air quality; Calibration; Low-cost sensing; Machine learning; Urban","Authors":"Johnson N.E., Bonczak B., Kontokosta C.E.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.atmosenv.2018.04.019","x":-5.0300002098,"y":7.9000000954,"KeyPhrases":["Air quality","novel calibration approach","regression tree model","overall sensor performance","Shinyei PPD42 aerosol"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Air quality","score":0.4721021354},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3898229599},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous urban environment","score":0.3848634064},{"key-phrase":"air pollution","score":0.3789123893},{"key-phrase":"Shinyei PPD42 aerosol","score":0.3631703854},{"key-phrase":"overall sensor performance","score":0.3556677103},{"key-phrase":"sensor's performance","score":0.352340281},{"key-phrase":"complex urban environment","score":0.3325704336},{"key-phrase":"quality monitoring device","score":0.3253528178},{"key-phrase":"linear regression","score":0.3218622208},{"key-phrase":"available meteorological data","score":0.3178251386},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.3019233346},{"key-phrase":"calibration","score":0.295191884},{"key-phrase":"novel calibration approach","score":0.2906473577},{"key-phrase":"low-cost air","score":0.2901752591},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.2894771695},{"key-phrase":"field calibration campaign","score":0.2790498435},{"key-phrase":"device calibration","score":0.2788862586},{"key-phrase":"quality monitoring platform","score":0.2785008252},{"key-phrase":"quality monitor","score":0.2721452713},{"key-phrase":"air","score":0.2519467473},{"key-phrase":"regression tree model","score":0.2486234903},{"key-phrase":"weather condition","score":0.232203126},{"key-phrase":"field evaluation study","score":0.162517339},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.1557285637},{"key-phrase":"serious respiratory illness","score":0.1498068571},{"key-phrase":"numerous laboratory","score":0.1290230453},{"key-phrase":"reference instrument","score":0.1251685321},{"key-phrase":"significant variation","score":0.0865934938},{"key-phrase":"important consideration","score":0.028783815},{"key-phrase":"March 25th","score":0.0134890378},{"key-phrase":"February 7th","score":0.0022358363},{"key-phrase":"unprecedented level","score":-0.0047501503},{"key-phrase":"further research","score":-0.0088542141}]},{"Cluster":28,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":448,"Cited by":12.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"A machine learning approach for localization in cellular environments","Abstract":"A machine learning approach is developed for localization based on received signal strength (RSS) from cellular towers.

This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm \u2013 Google Cloud Vision \u2013 to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20% of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; Recreation; Recreational ecosystem services; Singapore; Urban ecology","Authors":"Richards D.R., Tun\u00e7er B., Tun\u00e7er B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ecoser.2017.09.004","x":6.0700001717,"y":6.4400000572,"KeyPhrases":["cultural ecosystem service","manual classification","Google Cloud Vision","nature photographs","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"cultural ecosystem service","score":0.4880238175},{"key-phrase":"nature photographs","score":0.4822510779},{"key-phrase":"ecosystem service assessment","score":0.4630409479},{"key-phrase":"social medium photographs","score":0.4049966931},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical clustering","score":0.3924567699},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3797518611},{"key-phrase":"manual classification","score":0.3741494417},{"key-phrase":"high vegetation cover","score":0.3537577391},{"key-phrase":"Google Cloud Vision","score":0.3453320861},{"key-phrase":"ecosystem","score":0.3406108618},{"key-phrase":"content analysis","score":0.307186693},{"key-phrase":"manual content analysis","score":0.3002604246},{"key-phrase":"online machine learning","score":0.297013104},{"key-phrase":"photographs","score":0.2739935815},{"key-phrase":"large area","score":0.2683261335},{"key-phrase":"cultural use","score":0.2549029887},{"key-phrase":"social medium","score":0.2009470463},{"key-phrase":"manual work","score":0.1480248421},{"key-phrase":"particular natural attraction","score":0.1340853721},{"key-phrase":"large number","score":0.0581285954},{"key-phrase":"novel method","score":0.0574445948}]},{"Cluster":7,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":450,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Deep neural network dynamic traffic routing system for vehicles","Abstract":"Traffic grids have always suffered from a lack of dynamic routing and path planning algorithms and relied only on static characteristics of the roads like the number of lanes, distance and speed limits to avoid and resolve traffic congestion, by routing traffic to a lighter traffic path.

Traffic control has been shown to be a means of maintaining road serviceability with a key input being traffic inference. The harvesting of sufficiently large data sets for traffic inference has thus far been a challenge examined by the scientific community. A modelling, interactive design approach to the harvesting and preprocessing of vehicular data can be used to bridge the gap for traffic control to be autonomously implementable in an urban context. With this consideration, this paper explores the implementation of an internet of things multiagent system, in a network and equipped with sensors, distributed along the roadway to collect and share this vehicular data among its nodes and then process the data using a machine learning algorithm for learning and subsequent inference of vehicular types. An interactive design approach is used in the creation of a reduced model of knowledge from each node\u2019s bulk harvested data, which is then easily stored or deployed and which also facilitates post-processing of data. Considering the smart city as a product, the interactive approach to product engineering permits the implementation of these mathematical models as part of an interactive traffic control system, to ensure the city\u2019s adaptability to the ever-changing needs of its inhabitants. In this paper, we present the analysis of the trivial case of the detection of presence and absence of a class A type vehicle. In the introductory section, we examine the problem of transportation in urban expansion. In section two, we examine the solution provided by the Smart Cities with respect to transport services. Further problems which appear within these transport services and their respective solutions in machine learning and the internet of things are discussed in this section on these disruptive technologies. Section three examines the bibliography for successes achieved with similar research and also demonstrates the basis for classification by support vector machines.

It is a challenging work to extract the urban greenery information from remote sensing image as the trees and grassland are mixed with city built-ups. In this paper, we propose a new automatic pixel-based greenery extraction method using multispectral remote sensing images. The method includes three main steps. First, a small part of the images is manually interpreted to provide prior knowledge. Secondly, a five-layer neural network is trained and optimised with the manual extraction results, which are divided to serve as training samples, verification samples and testing samples. Lastly, the well-trained neural network will be applied to the unlabelled data to perform the greenery extraction. The GF-2 and GJ-1 high resolution multispectral remote sensing images were used to extract greenery coverage information in the built-up areas of city X. It shows a favourable performance in the 619 square kilometers areas. Also, when comparing with the traditional NDVI method, the proposed method gives a more accurate delineation of the greenery region. Due to the advantage of low computational load and high accuracy, it has a great potential for large area greenery auto extraction, which saves a lot of manpower and resources. \u00a9 Authors 2018.

The Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System is a limited-area working model with a horizontal resolution of 1.5 km for estimating local-scale weather forecasts on the Korean peninsula. However, in order to numerically predict the detailed temperature characteristics of the urban space, in which surface characteristics change rapidly in a small spatial area, a city temperature prediction model with higher resolution spatial decomposition capabilities is required. As an alternative to this, a building-scale temperature model was developed, and a 25 m air temperature resolution was determined for the Seoul area. The spatial information was processed using statistical methods, such as linear regression models and machine learning. By comparing the accuracy of the estimated air temperatures with observational data during the summer, the machine learning was improved. In addition, horizontal and vertical characteristics of the urban space were better represented, and the air temperature was better resolved spatially. Air temperature information can be used to manage the response to heat-waves and tropical nights in administrative districts of urban areas. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Building-scale air temperature; Heat-exposure map; Heat-wave; Statistical downscaling; Weather information service","Authors":"Yi C., Shin Y., Roh J.-W.","DOI":"10.3390\/atmos9050164","x":4.6700000763,"y":2.8499999046,"KeyPhrases":["city temperature prediction","spatial decomposition capability","Korean peninsula","various numerical model","Unified Model Local"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"city temperature prediction","score":0.7002398372},{"key-phrase":"local-scale weather","score":0.5158177614},{"key-phrase":"Korea Meteorological Administration","score":0.5103031397},{"key-phrase":"Air temperature information","score":0.4457217455},{"key-phrase":"forecasting data","score":0.4371802211},{"key-phrase":"complex and diverse weather phenomena","score":0.4198235869},{"key-phrase":"scale temperature model","score":0.414944917},{"key-phrase":"Prediction System","score":0.3801345825},{"key-phrase":"air temperature","score":0.3605036139},{"key-phrase":"various numerical model","score":0.3596564531},{"key-phrase":"linear regression model","score":0.3031095266},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3008787334},{"key-phrase":"Seoul area","score":0.2970017493},{"key-phrase":"Data Assimilation","score":0.2877247632},{"key-phrase":"spatial decomposition capability","score":0.2841709554},{"key-phrase":"detailed temperature characteristic","score":0.2780222893},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2774321437},{"key-phrase":"m air temperature","score":0.2707505822},{"key-phrase":"temperature","score":0.2628157735},{"key-phrase":"Korean peninsula","score":0.2498675734},{"key-phrase":"spatial information","score":0.2476216704},{"key-phrase":"Unified Model Local","score":0.2416213751},{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.2231350243},{"key-phrase":"observational data","score":0.1561722457},{"key-phrase":"small spatial area","score":0.1545891315},{"key-phrase":"statistical method","score":0.1398521662},{"key-phrase":"tropical night","score":0.1391236484},{"key-phrase":"peninsula","score":0.1082886606},{"key-phrase":"horizontal and vertical characteristic","score":0.1037967801},{"key-phrase":"administrative district","score":0.0953713357},{"key-phrase":"horizontal resolution","score":0.0429763347},{"key-phrase":"characteristic change","score":0.0306850374}]},{"Cluster":21,"Score":0.8613670192,"DocId":454,"Cited by":48.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"The effect of multi-dimensional indicators on urban thermal conditions","Abstract":"Urban heat island (UHI) studies have recognized ten factors as increasing the inner-city temperature compared with that of the surrounding suburbs. The UHI effect is a leading cause of heat-related diseases and mortality in many nations. However, there are still two main shortcomings. First, the effect of UHI is not well recognized in arid and semi-arid regions. Second, the association of multi-dimensional information with surface temperature in urban areas must be examined. This study focuses on the height-related aspects of urban geometry in an arid region. A range of multispectral and spatial vector data were used to derive the surface temperature and two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) information of the study area. All information was aggregated into a grid with common spatial resolution to create a homogeneous dataset. The machine learning statistical model of a boosted regression tree (BRT) was used to reflect the relative influence of 2D and 3D indicators with land surface temperature. Our results showed a cooler surface temperature in the city than in the surrounding area, leading to the question of whether the established UHI definition encompasses all types of cities. In addition, the thermal band was able to distinguish different spatial structures in the study area. The BRT analysis demonstrated that both multi-dimensional 2D and 3D indicators affect the surface temperature. In particular, the 3D indicators play a more important role than 2D indicators in shaping the surface temperature at different urban geometries of the study area. This new method can help urban planners identify the most influential 2D and 3D indicators that affect the surface temperature in different districts of a city. \u00a9 2017","Author Keywords":"3D modeling; Boosted regression tree analysis; Building shadows; Urban ecology; Urban heat island; Urban morphology","Authors":"Alavipanah S., Schreyer J., Haase D., Lakes T., Qureshi S.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jclepro.2017.12.187","x":4.9200000763,"y":2.7100000381,"KeyPhrases":["Urban heat island","regression tree","multispectral and spatial vector data","land surface temperature","UHI definition"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Urban heat island","score":0.4860794842},{"key-phrase":"land surface temperature","score":0.4775470495},{"key-phrase":"inner-city temperature","score":0.4764932096},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4014312029},{"key-phrase":"regression tree","score":0.398111701},{"key-phrase":"different urban geometry","score":0.3919363022},{"key-phrase":"urban geometry","score":0.3752499223},{"key-phrase":"multispectral and spatial vector data","score":0.3548234701},{"key-phrase":"arid and semi-arid region","score":0.3528028429},{"key-phrase":"arid region","score":0.3291665614},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3287383318},{"key-phrase":"surface temperature","score":0.3252702951},{"key-phrase":"temperature","score":0.2922057509},{"key-phrase":"statistical model","score":0.2593227029},{"key-phrase":"different spatial structure","score":0.249060154},{"key-phrase":"multi-dimensional information","score":0.2400343716},{"key-phrase":"multi-dimensional 2D","score":0.2178747356},{"key-phrase":"homogeneous dataset","score":0.2087686062},{"key-phrase":"thermal band","score":0.2077053338},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1696407199},{"key-phrase":"UHI definition","score":0.1427069008},{"key-phrase":"3D indicator","score":0.1289876401},{"key-phrase":"2D indicator","score":0.1267306358},{"key-phrase":"relative influence","score":0.1267079115},{"key-phrase":"common spatial resolution","score":0.1217460409},{"key-phrase":"surface","score":0.0978912488},{"key-phrase":"UHI effect","score":0.0970169604},{"key-phrase":"influential 2D","score":0.0922683328},{"key-phrase":"BRT analysis","score":0.0873480514},{"key-phrase":"new method","score":0.0562229119},{"key-phrase":"many nation","score":0.039074339},{"key-phrase":"different district","score":0.0383031592},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0378771052},{"key-phrase":"main shortcoming","score":-0.0129534304}]},{"Cluster":20,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":455,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Can we predict the scenic beauty of locations from geo-tagged Flickr images?","Abstract":"In this work, we propose a novel technique to determine the aesthetic score of a location from social metadata of Flickr photos.

However, insufficient weather stations limit accurate spatial representation of temperature within a heterogeneous city. This study used a random forest machine learning approach to estimate daily maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin) for two megacities with different climate characteristics: Los Angeles, USA, and Seoul, South Korea. This study used eight time-series land surface temperature (LST) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with seven auxiliary variables: elevation, solar radiation, normalized difference vegetation index, latitude, longitude, aspect, and the percentage of impervious area. We found different relationships between the eight time-series LSTs with Tmax\/Tmin for the two cities, and designed eight schemes with different input LST variables. The schemes were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 10-fold cross-validation. The best schemes produced R2 of 0.850 and 0.777 and RMSE of 1.7 \u00b0C and 1.2 \u00b0C for Tmax and Tmin in Los Angeles, and R2 of 0.728 and 0.767 and RMSE of 1.1 \u00b0C and 1.2 \u00b0C for Tmax and Tmin in Seoul, respectively. LSTs obtained the day before were crucial for estimating daily urban air temperature. Estimated air temperature patterns showed that Tmax was highly dependent on the geographic factors (e.g., sea breeze, mountains) of the two cities, while Tmin showed marginally distinct temperature differences between built-up and vegetated areas in the two cities. \u00a9 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

A high-resolution satellite image was used to generate spatial and texture metrics from the machine learning algorithm of Random Forests landcover classification. The most meaningful spatial indices were selected by visual inspection and then combined with the image and texture values to generate the classification. The proposed method for land-use mapping was tested using a 10-fold crossvalidation scheme, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.3% and a kappa coefficient of 0.896. These steps produced an accurate model of urban land use, without the use of any census or ancillary data, and suggest that the combined use of spatial metrics and texture is promising for urban land-use mapping in developing countries.

Enhancing human mobility prediction using local functions based on public records and SNS data","Abstract":"The quality of life for people in urban regions can be improved by predicting urban human mobility and adjusting urban planning accordingly. In this study, we compared several possible variables to verify whether a gravity model (a human mobility prediction model borrowed from Newtonian mechanics) worked as well in inner-city regions as it did in intra-city regions. We reviewed the resident population, the number of employees, and the number of SNS posts as variables for generating mass values for an urban traffic gravity model. We also compared the straight-line distance, travel distance, and the impact of time as possible distance values. We defined the functions of urban regions on the basis of public records and SNS data to reflect the diverse social factors in urban regions. In this process, we conducted a dimension reduction method for the public record data and used a machine learning-based clustering algorithm for the SNS data. In doing so, we found that functional distance could be defined as the Euclidean distance between social function vectors in urban regions. Finally, we examined whether the functional distance was a variable that had a significant impact on urban human mobility. \u00a9 2018 Kim et al.

This workflow consists of three consecutive stages: candidate identification, classification, and single vehicle extraction. Unlike in most previous approaches, fusion of both data sources is strongly pursued at all stages. While the first stage utilizes the fact that most man-made objects are rectangular in shape, the second and third stages employ machine learning techniques combined with specific features.

One way to tackle the problem is to resort to the emerging technologies in artificial intelligence. Traffic light control is one of the most traditional and important instruments for urban traffic management. The present study proposes a traffic light control system enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework in a decentralized manner. In the framework, a traffic network is decomposed into regions represented by region agents. Each region consists of intersections, modeled by intersection agents who coordinate with neighboring intersection agents through communication. For each intersection, a collection of turning movement agents operate individually and implement optimal actions according to local control policies. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm for each turning movement agent, the intersection controllers are enabled with the capability to make their timing decisions in a complex and dynamic environment. In addition, the traffic light control operates with an advanced phase composition process dynamically combining compatible turning movements. Moreover, the collective operations performed by the agents in a road network are further coordinated by varying priority settings for relevant turning movements. A case study was carried out by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed control system while comparing it with an optimized vehicle-actuated control system. The results show that the proposed traffic light system, after a collective machine learning process, not only improves the local signal operations at individual intersections but also enhances the traffic performance at the regional level through coordination of specific turning movements. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Collective machine learning; Decentralized system; Hierarchical model of traffic system; Learning-based control; Multi-agent traffic light control","Authors":"Jin J., Ma X.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.engappai.2017.10.013","x":5.22,"y":-1.92,"KeyPhrases":["urban traffic management","collective machine learning","hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework","intersection agent","traffic light system"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban traffic management","score":0.6731332541},{"key-phrase":"Traffic light control","score":0.6473312378},{"key-phrase":"traffic light system","score":0.6071327329},{"key-phrase":"traffic network","score":0.4541682005},{"key-phrase":"traffic congestion","score":0.4429607689},{"key-phrase":"intersection agent","score":0.4378233552},{"key-phrase":"intersection controller","score":0.435847342},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical multi-agent modeling framework","score":0.3781101108},{"key-phrase":"neighboring intersection agent","score":0.3691088557},{"key-phrase":"road network","score":0.3598933518},{"key-phrase":"collective machine learning","score":0.3481122851},{"key-phrase":"artificial intelligence","score":0.3213019371},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3124909401},{"key-phrase":"traffic performance","score":0.3005968332},{"key-phrase":"control system","score":0.2980357409},{"key-phrase":"collective operation","score":0.2930181026},{"key-phrase":"individual intersection","score":0.2912082076},{"key-phrase":"decentralized manner","score":0.2381207049},{"key-phrase":"movement agent","score":0.2360696793},{"key-phrase":"relevant turning movement","score":0.2254964709},{"key-phrase":"dynamic environment","score":0.207381025},{"key-phrase":"region agent","score":0.2043835223},{"key-phrase":"turning","score":0.1997959912},{"key-phrase":"local control policy","score":0.1988476366},{"key-phrase":"timing decision","score":0.1881093234},{"key-phrase":"optimal action","score":0.1853867322},{"key-phrase":"agent","score":0.1385852247},{"key-phrase":"regional level","score":0.1343115121},{"key-phrase":"metropolitan area","score":0.1332582086},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1081180647},{"key-phrase":"local signal operation","score":0.0905948728},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0643334314},{"key-phrase":"advanced phase composition","score":0.0625769794},{"key-phrase":"present study","score":0.0393803231},{"key-phrase":"significant challenge","score":0.0298673864},{"key-phrase":"traditional and important instrument","score":-0.0191045981}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":462,"Cited by":458.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Spectral-Spatial Residual Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification: A 3-D Deep Learning Framework","Abstract":"In this paper, we designed an end-to-end spectral-spatial residual network (SSRN) that takes raw 3-D cubes as input data without feature engineering for hyperspectral image classification.

In order to realize accurate and fast building detection, a non-interactive approach based on binary feature classification is brought forward in this paper. The proposed approach includes two major stages, i.e., building area detection and building contours extraction. In the first stage, a sequence of intersections is obtained by superpixel segmentation in the subsampled orthophoto, and then building area is reserved roughly according to the classification of intersections. In the second stage, the sequence of intersections is updated by superpixel segmentation in the building area from original orthophoto, and then building contours is extracted in accordance with the classification of intersections likewise. The local feature of the intersections is descripted employing our extremely compact binary descriptor, and is classified using binary bag-of-features. Experiments show that benefiting from binary description and making full use of texture details and color channels, the proposed descriptor is not only computationally frugal, but also accurate. Experiments are also conducted on orthophotos with different roof colors, textures, shapes, sizes and orientations, and demonstrate that the proposed approach are capable of achieving desirable results. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Author Keywords":"Building detection; Classifier; Descriptor; Local feature; Machine learning","Authors":"Hu Y., Hu X., Li P., Ding Y.","DOI":"10.1007\/s11042-017-5093-z","x":8.78,"y":-5.25,"KeyPhrases":["accurate and fast building detection","binary feature classification","subsampled orthophoto","superpixel segmentation","urban planning"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"accurate and fast building detection","score":0.6631228924},{"key-phrase":"Building detection","score":0.6290903091},{"key-phrase":"area detection","score":0.4946517646},{"key-phrase":"building contour extraction","score":0.4854745269},{"key-phrase":"superpixel segmentation","score":0.4846517444},{"key-phrase":"binary feature classification","score":0.4791543782},{"key-phrase":"compact binary descriptor","score":0.4024329782},{"key-phrase":"building area","score":0.3941637278},{"key-phrase":"subsampled orthophoto","score":0.3907393515},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3033702374},{"key-phrase":"local feature","score":0.2977157831},{"key-phrase":"binary description","score":0.2818835974},{"key-phrase":"binary bag","score":0.2705786228},{"key-phrase":"original orthophoto","score":0.2497722954},{"key-phrase":"texture detail","score":0.234062016},{"key-phrase":"different roof color","score":0.233150363},{"key-phrase":"real-estate management","score":0.2220544517},{"key-phrase":"binary","score":0.2134298682},{"key-phrase":"intersection","score":0.1737643331},{"key-phrase":"various application","score":0.1244194806},{"key-phrase":"color channel","score":0.1037636474},{"key-phrase":"desirable result","score":0.0452673212},{"key-phrase":"non-interactive approach","score":0.0345835313},{"key-phrase":"first stage","score":0.0202787612},{"key-phrase":"full use","score":0.0191380568},{"key-phrase":"major stage","score":-0.0072762724},{"key-phrase":"second stage","score":-0.0094808657},{"key-phrase":"Experiment show","score":-0.0423989967}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":464,"Cited by":null,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Urban sprawl modeling of Lahore, Pakistan using machine learning techniques","Abstract":"Population is the fundamental concentration because population is related with all resources and urban sprawl, an effect of socioeconomic improvement in specific conditions, has progressively turned into a noteworthy issue confronting numerous metropolitan zones.

Supervised classification method is applied to examine the urban expansion and to evaluate signatures of Lahore city into four categories (urban, vegetation, bare land and water bodies). For the land cover change analysis and to predict the urban sprawl in future different techniques and methods can be used and out of numerous, geospatial techniques like (MOLUSCE) QGIS plug-in, GIS along with remote sensing is used. In this study, Landsat V and VIII satellite images of 1998, 2008 and 2017 were used to classify the urban expansion. The precision appraisal was completed for characterized maps. Distinctive images Transition probability matrix and region change were acquired by utilizing plug-in created in QGIS and future year 2036 urban expansion was obtained. In this study, an attempt was made to develop a relationship between urban sprawl and population of Lahore. In light of accessible informational index, from 2017 to 2036 the change in urban area is 40% while a 367.02 sq.km loss in vegetation is chronicled. The majority of the urban sprawl occurred along primary roadways. The outcome demonstrates that urban region is relied upon to develop substantially higher in the year 2036 when contrasted with 2017.

Currently, community engagement for urban decision-making is often ineffective, uninformed, and only occurs in projects\u2019 later stages. To facilitate a more collaborative and evidence-based urban decision-making process for both experts and non-experts, real-time feedback and optimized suggestions are essential. However, most of the current tools for urban planning are neither capable of performing complex simulations in real-time nor of providing guidance for better urban performance. CityMatrix was introduced to address these challenges. Machine learning techniques were applied to achieve real-time prediction of multiple urban simulations, and thousands of city configurations were simulated. The simulation results were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the traffic and solar performance of unseen city configurations. The prediction with the CNN is thousands of times faster than the original simulations and maintains a high-quality representation of the results.

We have further developed a person detection method and introduced a person tracker as an intermediate stage between person detection and anomaly detection. The method is presented together with results from evaluations based on real sensor data that have been recorded in a realistic urban environment. Several scenarios have been recorded such as normal situations, a person loitering, a person shooting and people escaping from sudden smoke development. The method uses sensor data from a static video surveillance system, consisting of two visual and two thermal infrared cameras. The person detection method combines foreground segmentation with a trained machine learning algorithm which is based on boosting. The tracker associates incoming detections to objects (i.e. people), and generates tracks of world coordinates and velocities of objects. The anomaly detection method, which is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), fuses information that is derived from the tracker. The information contains a number of persons, their positions and velocities. The results indicate that the person detection method in combination with the tracker can produce robust and accurate observations to the HMM, which in turn provide good conditions for accurate anomaly detection. \u00a9 2018 SPIE.","Author Keywords":"Anomaly detection; Camera network; Hidden Markov model; Information fusion","Authors":"Andersson M., Hemstr\u00f6m F., Molin S.","DOI":"10.1117\/12.2326276","x":6.23,"y":-1.98,"KeyPhrases":["person detection method","violent event","accurate anomaly detection","hidden Markov model","urban environment"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"person detection method","score":0.543466866},{"key-phrase":"anomaly detection","score":0.5139940381},{"key-phrase":"anomaly detection method","score":0.5138322115},{"key-phrase":"person tracker","score":0.5107163787},{"key-phrase":"person detection","score":0.4792786837},{"key-phrase":"hidden Markov model","score":0.4535780549},{"key-phrase":"static video surveillance","score":0.4516473711},{"key-phrase":"accurate anomaly detection","score":0.4502064586},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.4230886698},{"key-phrase":"foreground segmentation","score":0.3758176863},{"key-phrase":"robust and accurate observation","score":0.3489913344},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3414677978},{"key-phrase":"real sensor data","score":0.3353426158},{"key-phrase":"violent event","score":0.3343858719},{"key-phrase":"sensor data","score":0.318993926},{"key-phrase":"incoming detection","score":0.3155211806},{"key-phrase":"person shooting","score":0.3024836183},{"key-phrase":"tracker","score":0.2890869975},{"key-phrase":"abnormal behavior","score":0.2883602679},{"key-phrase":"realistic urban environment","score":0.2645389438},{"key-phrase":"thermal infrared camera","score":0.2380730063},{"key-phrase":"sudden smoke development","score":0.2313206792},{"key-phrase":"person","score":0.2283055484},{"key-phrase":"person loitering","score":0.1957939565},{"key-phrase":"Several scenario","score":0.1938254535},{"key-phrase":"normal situation","score":0.1149160713},{"key-phrase":"world coordinate","score":0.0960615575},{"key-phrase":"good condition","score":0.0413508862},{"key-phrase":"intermediate stage","score":0.0249552019}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":467,"Cited by":null,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Ballparking the Urban placeness: A case study of analyzing starbucks posts on instagram","Abstract":"Placeness or the \u201csense of a place\u201d plays a vital role in urban design and planning.

We conduct our research by first adopting a flexible ontological framework to organize the concepts governing placeness. Next, we curate a dataset of community generated Instagram posts from Starbucks in three major metropolitan cities of the world: New York, Seoul, and Tokyo.

Three complex and real-life urban study areas were used as test datasets with various: (i) kinds of buildings structures of special architecture, (ii) pixel resolutions and, (iii) types of data. Objective evaluation metrics have been used for assessing the compared algorithms such recall, precision and F1-score as well as rates of completeness, correctness and quality. For both approaches, i.e., shadow detection and building detection, the computational complexity of each machine learning algorithm was examined.

Due to the simultaneous involvement of varied factors with an individual's perception of livability, this concept is difficult to measure. Therefore, a more objective means of quantifying livability is needed. The service industry has demonstrated the intersection of machine learning classifiers and survey domain knowledge for evaluating users' quality of experiences; however, this process of inquiry-based learning has never been considered for solving the communication difficulties between community stakeholders and transportation agencies. Another area of overlap is that of urban computing, which integrates computing technology in the traditional context of urban areas, connecting ubiquitous sensing technologies, computational power, and data about the urban environment to promote quality of life for people living in a particular community. To this aim, the focus of this study is on interpreting a linkage between society stated preferences and quantitative measures of livability by extracting information from survey-based methods and translating it to a quantitative framework using combined service industry and urban computing methodologies. This work focuses on four transportation planning-related research questions in this blended framework: understanding existing livability patterns, predicting heterogeneous perceptions of quality of life, prioritizing public preferences, and developing a multidimensional livability index (MLI). \u00a9 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Sarram G., Ivey S.S.","DOI":"10.1061\/9780784481561.019","x":6.2699999809,"y":4.4299998283,"KeyPhrases":["urban computing methodology","multidimensional livability index","survey domain knowledge","machine learning classifier","public preference"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban computing methodology","score":0.6100277901},{"key-phrase":"multidimensional livability index","score":0.5968144536},{"key-phrase":"livability management","score":0.5886590481},{"key-phrase":"urban computing","score":0.5114649534},{"key-phrase":"livability","score":0.5096461773},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4958981574},{"key-phrase":"residential quality","score":0.4889186025},{"key-phrase":"livability pattern","score":0.4464623332},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4402626157},{"key-phrase":"transportation planning","score":0.4355893731},{"key-phrase":"survey domain knowledge","score":0.4335697889},{"key-phrase":"transportation network","score":0.3335853815},{"key-phrase":"machine learning classifier","score":0.3223786652},{"key-phrase":"public preference","score":0.3196293712},{"key-phrase":"quantitative framework","score":0.3148272336},{"key-phrase":"individual's perception","score":0.3042530715},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood facility distribution","score":0.3038571179},{"key-phrase":"service industry","score":0.2816438973},{"key-phrase":"community stakeholder","score":0.269808948},{"key-phrase":"transportation agency","score":0.2623268962},{"key-phrase":"life satisfaction","score":0.2585805953},{"key-phrase":"quantitative measure","score":0.2473147362},{"key-phrase":"research question","score":0.2327919602},{"key-phrase":"particular community","score":0.2317298949},{"key-phrase":"combined service industry","score":0.2251029611},{"key-phrase":"computing","score":0.2242810875},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous perception","score":0.2023649216},{"key-phrase":"objective mean","score":0.1754056066},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive understanding","score":0.1736094654},{"key-phrase":"computational power","score":0.1601922214},{"key-phrase":"communication difficulty","score":0.1548866928},{"key-phrase":"blended framework","score":0.1480776519},{"key-phrase":"varied factor","score":0.0674218088},{"key-phrase":"key asset","score":0.0519473664},{"key-phrase":"simultaneous involvement","score":0.0417222232},{"key-phrase":"traditional context","score":0.0406457409}]},{"Cluster":28,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":471,"Cited by":36.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Air-to-Air Path Loss Prediction Based on Machine Learning Methods in Urban Environments","Abstract":"Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays an important role in many applications because of its high flexibility and low cost. To realize reliable UAV communications, a fundamental work is to investigate the propagation characteristics of the channels. In this paper, we propose path loss models for the UAV air-to-air (AA) scenario based on machine learning. A ray-tracing software is employed to generate samples for multiple routes in a typical urban environment, and different altitudes of Tx and Rx UAVs are taken into consideration. Two machine-learning algorithms, Random Forest and KNN, are exploited to build prediction models on the basis of the training data. The prediction performance of trained models is assessed on the test set according to the metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). Meanwhile, two empirical models are presented for comparison. It is shown that the machine-learning-based models are able to provide high prediction accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency in the AA scenario. Moreover, Random Forest outperforms other models and has the smallest prediction errors. Further investigation is made to evaluate the impacts of five different parameters on the path loss. It is demonstrated that the path visibility is crucial for the path loss. \u00a9 2018 Yan Zhang et al.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Zhang Y., Wen J., Yang G., He Z., Luo X.","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/8489326","x":4.0999999046,"y":1.6799999475,"KeyPhrases":["reliable UAV communication","path loss model","Random Forest","different altitude","acceptable computational efficiency"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"reliable UAV communication","score":0.5422874689},{"key-phrase":"UAV air","score":0.4829889536},{"key-phrase":"path loss model","score":0.4460391104},{"key-phrase":"unmanned aerial vehicle","score":0.4323459268},{"key-phrase":"path loss","score":0.4305232763},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.415976733},{"key-phrase":"Rx UAVs","score":0.398191005},{"key-phrase":"prediction model","score":0.3461241126},{"key-phrase":"prediction performance","score":0.3428468406},{"key-phrase":"high prediction accuracy","score":0.3233751059},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3166913688},{"key-phrase":"prediction error","score":0.3013284802},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.2993092835},{"key-phrase":"propagation characteristic","score":0.278116852},{"key-phrase":"multiple route","score":0.196464479},{"key-phrase":"path","score":0.189096272},{"key-phrase":"path visibility","score":0.183026582},{"key-phrase":"tracing software","score":0.1717820317},{"key-phrase":"empirical model","score":0.1650874764},{"key-phrase":"mean absolute error","score":0.1579737365},{"key-phrase":"square error","score":0.1517276019},{"key-phrase":"typical urban environment","score":0.1343149245},{"key-phrase":"AA","score":0.1261951923},{"key-phrase":"acceptable computational efficiency","score":0.1237413287},{"key-phrase":"low cost","score":0.1210140511},{"key-phrase":"many application","score":0.1165095195},{"key-phrase":"AA scenario","score":0.1160428375},{"key-phrase":"different altitude","score":0.1024841964},{"key-phrase":"other model","score":0.0766136348},{"key-phrase":"different parameter","score":0.0522242151},{"key-phrase":"Further investigation","score":0.0166208372},{"key-phrase":"fundamental work","score":0.0123728225},{"key-phrase":"high flexibility","score":-0.0027852599},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":-0.0101301949}]},{"Cluster":9,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":472,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Holistic visual data representation for built environment assessment","Abstract":"With an increasing interest of big data and its analysis, urban planners and architects use manifold data from different sources as an indicator of urban phenomena. To analyse them, machine learning models have been gotten fame to evaluate complex urban features with correlation matrix and cross validation. There are two major types of data such as top-down and bottom-up data. Interestingly, there is a third category of data that has not been widely deployed yet which we define as the 'Holistic visual data'. It is the general impression to your visual perception of urban environment when you at a specific spot that we believe can be captured by Google Street Views. This paper aims to ask how do top-down, bottomup, and holistic visual data work individually or together to predict the built environment value in urban areas. Admittedly, housing price is a highly spatial metric that involves multifarious interests including macroeconomic policies, the development of the area, the local people, and specific houses' features. To investigate the quality of built environment, machine learning techniques are adopted for different groups of datasets. By comparing several regression and classification models for each groups of data such as top-down, bottom-up and holistic visual data with housing price, the Random Forest model could be proposed as a best model. The intricate urban matrix needs to be organized such an order, but there are multiple factors affecting urban issues including land values and housing prices. By utilizing relevant machine learning models, it can be provided the practical guideline to architects and designers for improving the quality of built environment. \u00a9 2018 WIT Press.","Author Keywords":"Bottom-up data; Classification; Data science; Feature selection; Holistic visual data; Housing price prediction; Machine learning; Random forest regressor; Top-down data; Urban analysis","Authors":"Han J.M., Lee N.","DOI":"10.2495\/SDP-V13-N4-516-527","x":7.95,"y":-4.31,"KeyPhrases":["complex urban feature","Random Forest model","Holistic visual data","housing price","environment value"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"complex urban feature","score":0.5085220337},{"key-phrase":"Holistic visual data","score":0.4907640219},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.4713500738},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4657934904},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest model","score":0.4645915031},{"key-phrase":"intricate urban matrix","score":0.4627056122},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4320129454},{"key-phrase":"Google Street Views","score":0.4045268893},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.39069435},{"key-phrase":"land value","score":0.3875334263},{"key-phrase":"relevant machine learning","score":0.3690721989},{"key-phrase":"classification model","score":0.3650280237},{"key-phrase":"urban phenomenon","score":0.3637360036},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3601114154},{"key-phrase":"housing price","score":0.3594696522},{"key-phrase":"big data","score":0.349091053},{"key-phrase":"urban issue","score":0.3057036698},{"key-phrase":"bottom-up data","score":0.2943564653},{"key-phrase":"visual perception","score":0.2562931776},{"key-phrase":"manifold data","score":0.2521442473},{"key-phrase":"several regression","score":0.2519441843},{"key-phrase":"specific house","score":0.2266215384},{"key-phrase":"holistic","score":0.1903328747},{"key-phrase":"environment value","score":0.1660493314},{"key-phrase":"general impression","score":0.1625256836},{"key-phrase":"correlation matrix","score":0.1257827431},{"key-phrase":"third category","score":0.1031813398},{"key-phrase":"price","score":0.0859988108},{"key-phrase":"local people","score":0.0721594468},{"key-phrase":"specific spot","score":0.0692932904},{"key-phrase":"multifarious interest","score":0.0684826076},{"key-phrase":"multiple factor","score":0.0578791536},{"key-phrase":"major type","score":0.0556684956},{"key-phrase":"practical guideline","score":0.0456781164},{"key-phrase":"different source","score":0.0383813381},{"key-phrase":"macroeconomic policy","score":0.0203601848},{"key-phrase":"different group","score":0.0043179393}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":473,"Cited by":null,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Automatic semantic segmentation for change detection in remote sensing images","Abstract":"Change detection (CD) mainly focuses on the extraction of change information from multispectral remote sensing images of the same geographical location for environmental monitoring, natural disaster evaluation, urban studies, and deforestation monitoring.

Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Forest-a non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km2 in 1972 to 378 km2 in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh. \u00a9 2017 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Ensemble classifier; Greater Dhaka; Land cover change; Random forest; Remote sensing; Urban growth","Authors":"Hassan M.M., Southworth J.","DOI":"10.3390\/su10010010","x":9.51,"y":-3.96,"KeyPhrases":["urban land cover","algorithm Random Forest","multi-date Landsat imagery","human interpretation","Dhaka City Corporation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land cover","score":0.6124985814},{"key-phrase":"thematic land cover","score":0.5022998452},{"key-phrase":"land cover map","score":0.497043252},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.4865438938},{"key-phrase":"algorithm Random Forest","score":0.4854436517},{"key-phrase":"land cover change","score":0.4761109352},{"key-phrase":"urban land","score":0.4730842412},{"key-phrase":"classification algorithms","score":0.4025915265},{"key-phrase":"mega-urban region","score":0.4020187855},{"key-phrase":"image classification approach","score":0.3963939548},{"key-phrase":"vegetation cover","score":0.3944622576},{"key-phrase":"urban growth dynamic","score":0.3920751214},{"key-phrase":"huge urban expansion","score":0.3684509695},{"key-phrase":"image classification accuracy","score":0.3668802977},{"key-phrase":"agricultural land","score":0.363032043},{"key-phrase":"high classification accuracy","score":0.3430874944},{"key-phrase":"overall classification accuracy","score":0.3371567428},{"key-phrase":"multi-date Landsat imagery","score":0.3285143375},{"key-phrase":"spatial information","score":0.3218810856},{"key-phrase":"area statistic","score":0.3050377369},{"key-phrase":"sensor imagery","score":0.3009548187},{"key-phrase":"critical land","score":0.2842263579},{"key-phrase":"non-parametric ensemble classifier","score":0.275739491},{"key-phrase":"core city area","score":0.2483718097},{"key-phrase":"spatial and temporal information","score":0.2469800711},{"key-phrase":"ecological risk","score":0.2385741621},{"key-phrase":"dhaka","score":0.2340374738},{"key-phrase":"environmental resource","score":0.2296021283},{"key-phrase":"thematic map","score":0.2241078913},{"key-phrase":"Dhaka City Corporation","score":0.2224000692},{"key-phrase":"growth rate","score":0.2008763254},{"key-phrase":"annual growth rate","score":0.1912475824},{"key-phrase":"temporal and spatial scale","score":0.1864270568},{"key-phrase":"southwest region","score":0.1857342571},{"key-phrase":"average annual growth rate","score":0.184428066},{"key-phrase":"Accurate information","score":0.1840668172},{"key-phrase":"independent cross-validation technique","score":0.1827253401},{"key-phrase":"human interpretation","score":0.1771616638},{"key-phrase":"producer accuracy","score":0.1708615124},{"key-phrase":"Detailed knowledge","score":0.1503557563},{"key-phrase":"environmental factor","score":0.1366855502},{"key-phrase":"northern corridor","score":0.1337724626},{"key-phrase":"Maximum Likelihood","score":0.1230998784},{"key-phrase":"intricate nature","score":0.1171302572},{"key-phrase":"annual expansion rate","score":0.1158348024},{"key-phrase":"net increase rate","score":0.111275278},{"key-phrase":"open-source computing","score":0.1083890945},{"key-phrase":"detailed understanding","score":0.0956143662},{"key-phrase":"peripheral area","score":0.0952713937},{"key-phrase":"transportation network","score":0.0929072872},{"key-phrase":"kappa value","score":0.0900692195},{"key-phrase":"year study period","score":0.0659865737},{"key-phrase":"time period","score":0.0448638573},{"key-phrase":"employment center","score":0.0424863026},{"key-phrase":"annual","score":0.0369564742},{"key-phrase":"traditional approach","score":0.0338875838},{"key-phrase":"main factor","score":0.0241935756},{"key-phrase":"water body","score":0.0211373493},{"key-phrase":"quantum increase","score":0.0132174082}]},{"Cluster":12,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":476,"Cited by":61.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Exploring the optimal integration levels between SAR and optical data for better urban land cover mapping in the Pearl River Delta","Abstract":"Integrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data to improve urban land cover classification has been identified as a promising approach. However, which integration level is the most suitable remains unclear but important to many researchers and engineers. This study aimed to compare different integration levels for providing a scientific reference for a wide range of studies using optical and SAR data. SAR data from TerraSAR-X and ENVISAT ASAR in both WSM and IMP modes were used to be combined with optical data at pixel level, feature level and decision levels using four typical machine learning methods. The experimental results indicated that: 1) feature level that used both the original images and extracted features achieved a significant improvement of up to 10% compared to that using optical data alone; 2) different levels of fusion required different suitable methods depending on the data distribution and data resolution. For instance, support vector machine was the most stable at both the feature and decision levels, while random forest was suitable at the pixel level but not suitable at the decision level. 3) By examining the distribution of SAR features, some features (e.g., homogeneity) exhibited a close-to-normal distribution, explaining the improvement from the maximum likelihood method at the feature and decision levels. This indicated the benefits of using texture features from SAR data when being combined with optical data for land cover classification. Additionally, the research also shown that combining optical and SAR data does not guarantee improvement compared with using single data source for urban land cover classification, depending on the selection of appropriate fusion levels and fusion methods. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Fusion level; Fusion strategies; Optical and SAR fusion; Urban land cover","Authors":"Zhang H., Xu R.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jag.2017.08.013","x":9.67,"y":-4.59,"KeyPhrases":["land cover classification","synthetic aperture radar","support vector machine","appropriate fusion level","texture feature"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land cover classification","score":0.5582072735},{"key-phrase":"SAR feature","score":0.5581091046},{"key-phrase":"SAR data","score":0.5296549797},{"key-phrase":"synthetic aperture radar","score":0.4770932496},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4507008791},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.448169589},{"key-phrase":"urban land cover","score":0.4381124973},{"key-phrase":"SAR","score":0.4148113132},{"key-phrase":"typical machine learning","score":0.3288129568},{"key-phrase":"texture feature","score":0.2982298434},{"key-phrase":"optical data","score":0.2535895109},{"key-phrase":"fusion method","score":0.2204069793},{"key-phrase":"optical","score":0.1762973368},{"key-phrase":"ENVISAT ASAR","score":0.175322637},{"key-phrase":"feature level","score":0.1744506508},{"key-phrase":"data resolution","score":0.1373756826},{"key-phrase":"pixel level","score":0.1241684482},{"key-phrase":"decision level","score":0.1120150909},{"key-phrase":"data distribution","score":0.1056461036},{"key-phrase":"appropriate fusion level","score":0.1049293429},{"key-phrase":"different suitable method","score":0.091080904},{"key-phrase":"maximum likelihood method","score":0.0827948377},{"key-phrase":"IMP mode","score":0.0698698685},{"key-phrase":"original image","score":0.0678845644},{"key-phrase":"single data source","score":0.0642021149},{"key-phrase":"different integration level","score":0.0631823763},{"key-phrase":"wide range","score":0.0628334954},{"key-phrase":"scientific reference","score":0.0583714694},{"key-phrase":"experimental result","score":0.055110164},{"key-phrase":"many researcher","score":0.0507807024},{"key-phrase":"integration level","score":0.0488158315},{"key-phrase":"significant improvement","score":0.037499249},{"key-phrase":"different level","score":0.0374271721},{"key-phrase":"normal distribution","score":0.0318904147},{"key-phrase":"promising approach","score":0.0198950097},{"key-phrase":"suitable remains","score":-0.0148394825}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":477,"Cited by":39.0,"Year":2018,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"StreetVizor: Visual Exploration of Human-Scale Urban Forms Based on Street Views","Abstract":"Urban forms at human-scale, i.e., urban environments that individuals can sense (e.g., sight, smell, and touch) in their daily lives, can provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, such as urban planning and environment auditing. The analysis of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design. However, such analysis is complex because of the involvement of spatial, multi-scale (i.e., city, region, and street), and multivariate (e.g., greenery and sky ratios) natures of urban forms. In addition, current methods either lack quantitative measurements or are limited to a small area. The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales; 2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns. We illustrate the applicability of our approach with case studies on the real-world datasets of four cities, i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, Greater London and New York City. Interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in facilitating various analytical tasks. \u00a9 1995-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"human scale; street view; Urban forms; visual analytics","Authors":"Shen Q., Zeng W., Ye Y., Arisona S.M., Schubiger S., Burkhard R., Qu H.","DOI":"10.1109\/TVCG.2017.2744159","x":7.49,"y":-4.45,"KeyPhrases":["human-scale urban form","interactive visual analytics system","domain knowledge","sky ratio","street view image"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"human-scale urban form","score":0.6996366978},{"key-phrase":"high-quality urban space","score":0.6273319721},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.6138042808},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.5567451715},{"key-phrase":"Urban form","score":0.518568933},{"key-phrase":"street view pattern","score":0.5184057951},{"key-phrase":"street view image","score":0.487203002},{"key-phrase":"visual exploration","score":0.4792687893},{"key-phrase":"visualization technique","score":0.3818398416},{"key-phrase":"interactive visual analytics system","score":0.3708312809},{"key-phrase":"visual comparison","score":0.3691316545},{"key-phrase":"real-world datasets","score":0.357124269},{"key-phrase":"Street Explorer","score":0.3245598078},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained detail","score":0.3152249455},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.2766086161},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.2741647363},{"key-phrase":"environment auditing","score":0.221676752},{"key-phrase":"Greater London","score":0.212554425},{"key-phrase":"various analytical task","score":0.2090428919},{"key-phrase":"domain knowledge","score":0.1991549283},{"key-phrase":"explorer","score":0.1986436248},{"key-phrase":"quantitative measurement","score":0.1971794367},{"key-phrase":"planner leverage","score":0.1955584288},{"key-phrase":"novel parallel coordinate plot","score":0.1911112666},{"key-phrase":"domain expert","score":0.186249733},{"key-phrase":"AOI Explorer","score":0.1714900732},{"key-phrase":"sky ratio","score":0.164718464},{"key-phrase":"such analysis","score":0.1622987986},{"key-phrase":"form","score":0.1582327336},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.1555280685},{"key-phrase":"daily life","score":0.1277180463},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.1232280731},{"key-phrase":"small area","score":0.1198695228},{"key-phrase":"Hong Kong","score":0.1168975383},{"key-phrase":"unprecedented insight","score":0.0978521109},{"key-phrase":"current method","score":0.005342308},{"key-phrase":"primary contribution","score":0.0040753186}]},{"Cluster":14,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":478,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"3D shape descriptor for objects recognition","Abstract":"3D point cloud classification is an important task in applications for many areas such as robotics, urban planning and augmented reality. 3D sensors measure a high amount of points in the 3D scene objects' surface at a high collect rate, so robust techniques are needed to process all input data and also deal with some imprecision.

As the first selfdeveloped C-band multi-polarized SAR image, the acquisition of massive data and operational operation of Chinese SAR remote sensing has entered the era of big data. Under the era of remote sensing large data, however, SAR image interpretation is a great challenge for scientific applications. At present, big data-based intelligent methods such as computer vision technology have achieved great success. Deep learning such as deep highway unit networks has revolutionized the computer vision area. However, due to the characteristics of SAR microwave band imaging and phase coherence processing, SAR images are very different from ordinary optical images in terms of band, projection direction, data composition and so on. Therefore, deep learning can not be directly used for quad-pol SAR image classification. In this paper, deep learning is applied to land cover type classification with GF-3 quad-pol SAR imagery. A deep highway unit network is employed to automatically extract a hierarchic feature representation from the data, based on which the land cover type classification can be conducted.

We hypothesize that most industries develop new entities based on the number of companies from the same industry that already exist in a region. We also hypothesize that entrepreneurs create new entities based on related industries operating within the same knowledge pool. To test these hypotheses, we used the machine learning decision tree method. The input variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland in 2009. The target values are the number of new companies from these industries created in the years 2009-2015. The principal results show that localization decisions are mostly based on demand and supply industries, in which manufacturing industries play crucial role. Path dependency appears in less than half of the industries' models and thus is not the main factor influencing decisions regarding the creation of new companies. The highest share of path-dependent industries is in manufacturing sector, but the degree of the dependence is lower than in the service sector. The service sector seems to be the least path-dependent, as services usually serve other industries. Competition in industries is a rare factor in new company creation; however, if it appears, it usually shrinks the industry. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Pylak K., Majerek D.","DOI":"10.1088\/1757-899X\/245\/6\/062025","x":6.8099999428,"y":4.8600001335,"KeyPhrases":["dependent industry","decision tree method","localization decision","new company creation","same knowledge pool"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"dependent industry","score":0.4729084074},{"key-phrase":"related industry operating","score":0.4225303531},{"key-phrase":"new company creation","score":0.4134817123},{"key-phrase":"localization decision","score":0.4103308022},{"key-phrase":"manufacturing industry play","score":0.3815079927},{"key-phrase":"industry","score":0.3562592268},{"key-phrase":"other industry","score":0.3552758098},{"key-phrase":"same industry","score":0.3548397422},{"key-phrase":"different industry","score":0.3480644524},{"key-phrase":"new company","score":0.3421229422},{"key-phrase":"decision tree method","score":0.3351817131},{"key-phrase":"market force","score":0.3188516796},{"key-phrase":"supply industry","score":0.2978807092},{"key-phrase":"service sector","score":0.2957617044},{"key-phrase":"company","score":0.2693263888},{"key-phrase":"same knowledge pool","score":0.231856823},{"key-phrase":"main factor","score":0.2022516429},{"key-phrase":"path dependency","score":0.1912566423},{"key-phrase":"new entity","score":0.1626363546},{"key-phrase":"target value","score":0.1186112165},{"key-phrase":"crucial role","score":0.1067784205},{"key-phrase":"rare factor","score":0.0880866498},{"key-phrase":"input variable","score":0.0874868035},{"key-phrase":"principal result","score":0.0649643689}]},{"Cluster":27,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":481,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Artificial Neural Networks as an Architectural Design Tool-Generating New Detail Forms Based on the Roman Corinthian Order Capital","Abstract":"The following paper presents the results of the research in the field of the machine learning, investigating the scope of application of the artificial neural networks algorithms as a tool in architectural design. The computational experiment was held using the backward propagation of errors method of training the artificial neural network, which was trained based on the geometry of the details of the Roman Corinthian order capital. During the experiment, as an input training data set, five local geometry parameters combined has given the best results: Theta, Pi, Rho in spherical coordinate system based on the capital volume centroid, followed by Z value of the Cartesian coordinate system and a distance from vertical planes created based on the capital symmetry. Additionally during the experiment, artificial neural network hidden layers optimal count and structure was found, giving results of the error below 0.2% for the mentioned before input parameters. Once successfully trained artificial network, was able to mimic the details composition on any other geometry type given. Despite of calculating the transformed geometry locally and separately for each of the thousands of surface points, system could create visually attractive and diverse, complex patterns. Designed tool, based on the supervised learning method of machine learning, gives possibility of generating new architectural forms- free of the designer's imagination bounds.

Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the fa\u00e7ades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their fa\u00e7ade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"GSV (Google Street View); image features; machine learning; urban land-use mapping","Authors":"Li X., Zhang C., Li W.","DOI":"10.1080\/15481603.2017.1338389","x":6.2300000191,"y":6.3499999046,"KeyPhrases":["scene classification algorithms","urban land","GSV image","Google Street View","different building block"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"scene classification algorithms","score":0.5075705647},{"key-phrase":"developed scene classification","score":0.4705553055},{"key-phrase":"urban land","score":0.4691295624},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.4687570333},{"key-phrase":"Google Street View","score":0.4668225944},{"key-phrase":"SVM classifier","score":0.4350372851},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4138668478},{"key-phrase":"detailed land","score":0.411811471},{"key-phrase":"residential building","score":0.3804414272},{"key-phrase":"image feature descriptor","score":0.3557510376},{"key-phrase":"training datasets","score":0.3174583912},{"key-phrase":"use map","score":0.2939133346},{"key-phrase":"various image feature","score":0.2898656726},{"key-phrase":"computer vision community","score":0.2893442214},{"key-phrase":"nonresidential building","score":0.2844045758},{"key-phrase":"urban study","score":0.2765809298},{"key-phrase":"GSV image","score":0.270478487},{"key-phrase":"use mapping","score":0.2600795925},{"key-phrase":"fa\u00e7ade appearance","score":0.2529161572},{"key-phrase":"different building","score":0.2370312661},{"key-phrase":"different land","score":0.2108405679},{"key-phrase":"building block level","score":0.2103582174},{"key-phrase":"different building block","score":0.2038123161},{"key-phrase":"invariant feature","score":0.1938322037},{"key-phrase":"GSV","score":0.163522467},{"key-phrase":"building block","score":0.1562455297},{"key-phrase":"different photo","score":0.1501305699},{"key-phrase":"Accuracy assessment result","score":0.1462545693},{"key-phrase":"case study area","score":0.1328460276},{"key-phrase":"use type","score":0.1131991595},{"key-phrase":"use information","score":0.1127875},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.0565077141},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0408878177},{"key-phrase":"block","score":0.0185378157},{"key-phrase":"important reference","score":0.0182959102},{"key-phrase":"new way","score":0.0174037032}]},{"Cluster":20,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":483,"Cited by":47.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Mapping urban form and function at city block level using spatial metrics","Abstract":"This paper focuses on the potential of urban metrics describing the presence and the configuration of built-up and open space areas for mapping distinct types of urban form and function at city block level. Next to traditional, patch-based metrics used in landscape ecology, alternative metrics are proposed, measuring the presence and the spatial arrangement of built-up and open space areas along a set of radial transects, along contours parallel to the urban block boundary and along the block's perimeter, as well as metrics describing the internal composition of the built-up area. Use of the proposed metrics for identifying different types of urban form and function was tested on the Brussels Capital Region. Large-scale vector data was used to define built-up structures and to analyse the morphological properties of the built-up area at block level. Decision tree classification was applied in conjunction with bootstrap aggregation to gain insight in the distinctive character of the defined metrics, and the robustness of land use and urban form classification based on these metrics. Our study points out the shortcomings of traditional landscape ecological metrics for mapping urban form and emphasizes the need for alternative approaches for analysing urban landscapes, more explicitly describing the morphological characteristics of the urban fabric. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Brussels Capital Region; Land use; Machine learning; Spatial metrics; Urban form; Urban function","Authors":"Vanderhaegen S., Canters F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2017.05.023","x":6.7800002098,"y":5.3600001335,"KeyPhrases":["urban form classification","landscape ecology","bootstrap aggregation","Decision tree classification","metric"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban form classification","score":0.6949980259},{"key-phrase":"urban landscape","score":0.6005194783},{"key-phrase":"urban form","score":0.4859086275},{"key-phrase":"urban block boundary","score":0.456217885},{"key-phrase":"landscape ecology","score":0.4415746331},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.4086512923},{"key-phrase":"Decision tree classification","score":0.3781018853},{"key-phrase":"traditional landscape","score":0.3267051578},{"key-phrase":"morphological characteristic","score":0.3244267106},{"key-phrase":"urban fabric","score":0.3150436878},{"key-phrase":"Brussels Capital Region","score":0.2962444425},{"key-phrase":"open space area","score":0.2940913141},{"key-phrase":"city block level","score":0.2897423506},{"key-phrase":"metric","score":0.2432921231},{"key-phrase":"bootstrap aggregation","score":0.2122537196},{"key-phrase":"morphological property","score":0.2067985535},{"key-phrase":"radial transects","score":0.1965899467},{"key-phrase":"Large-scale vector","score":0.1697249115},{"key-phrase":"spatial arrangement","score":0.1451186538},{"key-phrase":"distinctive character","score":0.1444239616},{"key-phrase":"distinct type","score":0.1355724484},{"key-phrase":"block's perimeter","score":0.1282142252},{"key-phrase":"contour parallel","score":0.1091541573},{"key-phrase":"different type","score":0.0808190852},{"key-phrase":"internal composition","score":0.0743116066},{"key-phrase":"study point","score":0.0535566173},{"key-phrase":"block level","score":0.0342256501},{"key-phrase":"alternative approach","score":0.0037661763},{"key-phrase":"block","score":-0.0124888923}]},{"Cluster":19,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":484,"Cited by":19.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Structure and information in spatial segregation","Abstract":"Ethnoracial residential segregation is a complex, multiscalar phenomenon with immense moral and economic costs. Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify. They are computationally efficient, applicable to a broad range of study questions, and freely available in open source software. \u00a9 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Considering examples of New York City, Boston and Chicago, we demonstrate how 311 Service Requests recorded and categorized by type in each neighborhood can be utilized to generate a meaningful classification of locations across the city, based on distinctive socioeconomic profiles. Moreover, the 311-based classification of urban neighborhoods can present sufficient information to model various socioeconomic features.

Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as \u2018where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration\u2019 and \u2018in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing\u2019. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents. \u00a9 2017 The Authors","Author Keywords":"Architecture; Machine learning; Physical quality; Street view image; Urban design","Authors":"Liu L., Silva E.A., Wu C., Wang H.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.compenvurbsys.2017.06.003","x":7.4,"y":-4.73,"KeyPhrases":["urban visual experience","machine learning model","maintenance quality","public rating score","large-scale and automatic evaluation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban visual experience","score":0.6040122509},{"key-phrase":"city appearance","score":0.5429944992},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.5289205313},{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.5131803751},{"key-phrase":"fast urbanising city","score":0.4866016805},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.4190227985},{"key-phrase":"modern city","score":0.3778919578},{"key-phrase":"large-scale and automatic evaluation","score":0.3716997802},{"key-phrase":"computer vision method","score":0.3418447375},{"key-phrase":"wide-coverage street","score":0.3201135397},{"key-phrase":"maintenance quality","score":0.2900133133},{"key-phrase":"street wall","score":0.2640618682},{"key-phrase":"perceptual capacity","score":0.2628896832},{"key-phrase":"physical environment","score":0.2601028681},{"key-phrase":"various physical quality","score":0.2584660649},{"key-phrase":"quality","score":0.2556271553},{"key-phrase":"street corner","score":0.2310274988},{"key-phrase":"key quality","score":0.2273806632},{"key-phrase":"public rating score","score":0.2166198492},{"key-phrase":"art machine","score":0.1757216752},{"key-phrase":"machine scores","score":0.1756544113},{"key-phrase":"modelling result","score":0.1665523946},{"key-phrase":"real experience","score":0.1548605561},{"key-phrase":"first consideration","score":0.1117064282},{"key-phrase":"view image","score":0.1103933677},{"key-phrase":"good estimation","score":0.1058234721},{"key-phrase":"local resident","score":0.0975630283},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0846206173},{"key-phrase":"previous research","score":0.0814950317},{"key-phrase":"many way","score":0.0764304623},{"key-phrase":"present size","score":0.0570652708},{"key-phrase":"good knowledge","score":0.0568842553},{"key-phrase":"present study","score":0.0550586581},{"key-phrase":"present","score":0.0536259934}]},{"Cluster":11,"Score":0.9265918913,"DocId":490,"Cited by":83.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Using convolutional networks and satellite imagery to identify patterns in urban environments at a large scale","Abstract":"Urban planning applications (energy audits, investment, etc.) require an understanding of built infrastructure and its environment, i.e., both low-level, physical features (amount of vegetation, building area and geometry etc.), as well as higher-level concepts such as land use classes (which encode expert understanding of socioeconomic end uses). This kind of data is expensive and labor-intensive to obtain, which limits its availability (particularly in developing countries). We analyze patterns in land use in urban neighborhoods using large-scale satellite imagery data (which is available worldwide from third-party providers) and state-of-the-art computer vision techniques based on deep convolutional neural networks. For supervision, given the limited availability of standard benchmarks for remote-sensing data, we obtain ground truth land use class labels carefully sampled from open-source surveys, in particular the Urban Atlas land classification dataset of 20 land use classes across 300 European cities. We use this data to train and compare deep architectures which have recently shown good performance on standard computer vision tasks (image classification and segmentation), including on geospatial data. Furthermore, we show that the deep representations extracted from satellite imagery of urban environments can be used to compare neighborhoods across several cities.

Understanding which factors shape this perception informs both urban planners, that aim at improving city life, as well as computational models that help us navigate in urban spaces. To understand cities at scale, crowdsourcing games have been employed successfully to evaluate citizens' opinions about cities and urban scenes. By analyzing human perceptions from residents of a mid-sized Brazilian city, this work brings three novel contributions. First, we consider theories from urban design to explore through crowdsourcing which high and low level features in an urban space are linked to perceptions of safety and pleasantness. Secondly, this paper leverages theory from urban sociology and anthropology to show how the sociodemographic pro.le of the citizens signi.cantly mediate their perception of safeness and pleasantness of places. Finally, we show that features of the urban form proposed by urbanists can be combined with sociodemographics to improve the accuracy of machine learning models that predict which scene a person will .nd more safe or pleasant. .is last result paves the road for more personalized recommendations in cold-start scenarios. \u00a9 2017 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Crowdsourcing; Urban Informatics; Urban Perception","Authors":"Candeia D., Figueiredo F., Andrade N., Quercia D.","DOI":"10.1145\/3078714.3078728","x":7.03,"y":-4.26,"KeyPhrases":["urban design","personalized recommendation","human perception","public space","mid-sized Brazilian city"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban design","score":0.5504289865},{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.5335386395},{"key-phrase":"city life","score":0.5010113716},{"key-phrase":"urban sociology","score":0.4731881917},{"key-phrase":"urban form","score":0.4381325245},{"key-phrase":"urban scene","score":0.4321985841},{"key-phrase":"public space","score":0.4232450724},{"key-phrase":"human perception","score":0.4158784747},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.4011599422},{"key-phrase":"personalized recommendation","score":0.3469286561},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.3431727588},{"key-phrase":"mid-sized Brazilian city","score":0.3402426243},{"key-phrase":"perception","score":0.3172521293},{"key-phrase":"pleasantness","score":0.287055552},{"key-phrase":"high and low level feature","score":0.2123118639},{"key-phrase":"computational model","score":0.1783249229},{"key-phrase":"last result","score":0.1133021042},{"key-phrase":"novel contribution","score":0.0979216546},{"key-phrase":"factor shape","score":0.0887414962},{"key-phrase":"cold-start scenario","score":0.0500465706}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":493,"Cited by":13.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Transparency in practice: Using visualization to enhance the interpretability of open data","Abstract":"Urban data is gradually being opened to the public.

Although the ML concept is a new paradigm with nonexclusive classes and has shown considerable merit in several applications, few studies in land change science have applied it. In addition, determining transition rules in conventional CA is difficult when the number of drivers is large. Since CA has been shown as a potential model to consider neighborhood effects and ANN has been shown effective in determining CA transition rules, we integrated both CA with an ANN model to overcome limitations of each tool. In this study, we specifically extended the ANN-based Land Transformation Model (LTM) with both a CA-based model and the ML concept to create an integrated ML-CA-LTM modeling framework. We also compared, using standard evaluation measures, differences between the proposed integrated model with a conventional CA-based LTM model (called the ml-CA-LTM). Parameterization was made using a learning and testing procedure common in machine learning. Results showed that the modified LUC model, ML-CA-LTM, produced consistently better goodness of fit calibration values compared to the ml-CA-LTM. The outcome of this modified model can be used by managers and decision makers for improved urban planning. \u00a9 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"arti\ufb01cial neural networks; cellular automata; land-use change; mono-label class; multi-label classes","Authors":"Omrani H., Tayyebi A., Pijanowski B.","DOI":"10.1080\/15481603.2016.1265706","x":8.94,"y":-3.17,"KeyPhrases":["Land Transformation Model","Cellular automata","use class","urban planning","artificial neural network"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Land Transformation Model","score":0.6210101247},{"key-phrase":"land change science","score":0.5051465631},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4318855703},{"key-phrase":"Cellular automata","score":0.4283016622},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.3560304046},{"key-phrase":"ANN model","score":0.316137135},{"key-phrase":"ML concept","score":0.2668050826},{"key-phrase":"several land","score":0.2650922537},{"key-phrase":"CA transition rule","score":0.2342346311},{"key-phrase":"transition rule","score":0.2296343893},{"key-phrase":"neighborhood effect","score":0.224511385},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2209715694},{"key-phrase":"LTM modeling framework","score":0.2180868089},{"key-phrase":"use change","score":0.1953065991},{"key-phrase":"LTM model","score":0.1916788071},{"key-phrase":"integrated ML","score":0.1557383239},{"key-phrase":"use class","score":0.137141183},{"key-phrase":"several application","score":0.117250517},{"key-phrase":"potential model","score":0.107766524},{"key-phrase":"LUC model","score":0.0988285244},{"key-phrase":"new paradigm","score":0.0973626301},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.0857538581},{"key-phrase":"fit calibration value","score":0.0832858458},{"key-phrase":"standard evaluation measure","score":0.074689813},{"key-phrase":"conventional CA","score":0.0686979219},{"key-phrase":"testing procedure","score":0.0669667199},{"key-phrase":"CA","score":0.0645810515},{"key-phrase":"LTM","score":0.0403738543},{"key-phrase":"nonexclusive class","score":0.0237416998},{"key-phrase":"few study","score":0.0016496591},{"key-phrase":"considerable merit","score":-0.0409361199}]},{"Cluster":21,"Score":0.8613670192,"DocId":495,"Cited by":null,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Multi-scale modeling of territorial dynamics of geospatial anthropogenic energy consumption","Abstract":"Objective: The development of any region or territory stems from its own dynamic nature. Distribution and consumption of energy resources are varied territorially which in turn is ruled by the number of anthropogenic activities in association with geospatial localization. Such territorial dynamics necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Thus, the development of a computational multi-scale unified energy consumption model with the usage of geographic information helps in automating data analysis processes for sustainable urban planning, allocation of energy-saving infrastructures, and strategic deployment of the renewable energy resources to finely regulate the utilization of energy resources for sustainable energy consumption. Method: The integration of city-wide energy system models and geographic information systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. The research work is divided into five interrelated work packages. The Modelling problem is achieved with the help of analytical hierarchical process. Thus, we propose a computational infrastructure for modelling city-wide geospatial energy consumption and automating the data analysis process to provide the sustainable environmental policy, which requires artificial intelligence-based geospatial aware comprehensive planning, regarding the modification of the energy supply, consumption, activities, and infrastructures in cities. Results and Discussion: Thus, end result of the presented research work is fine-grained energy demand estimation from data sources, decentralized storage facility, and automated sustainable planning; investigation of GIS-based anthropogenic activities or mobility pattern influencing the wastage of energy resources, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, and, finally, the development of a new dynamic-based power market design. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"Computational modeling; Geographic information systems; Machine learning-based data analysis","Authors":"Rai A., Jagadeesh Kannan R.","DOI":"10.22159\/ajpcr.2017.v10s1.19744","x":5.1399998665,"y":3.9000000954,"KeyPhrases":["wide geospatial energy consumption","analytical hierarchical process","sustainable urban planning","geographic information system","demand estimation"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"wide geospatial energy consumption","score":0.6612327695},{"key-phrase":"sustainable urban planning","score":0.5679404736},{"key-phrase":"multi-scale unified energy consumption","score":0.5105489492},{"key-phrase":"sustainable energy consumption","score":0.4706600904},{"key-phrase":"sustainable planning","score":0.4683130383},{"key-phrase":"geographic information system","score":0.4570114911},{"key-phrase":"energy infrastructure","score":0.4302445948},{"key-phrase":"wide energy system","score":0.3692110479},{"key-phrase":"geographic information","score":0.3617449999},{"key-phrase":"energy resource","score":0.3481523991},{"key-phrase":"renewable energy resource","score":0.3450228274},{"key-phrase":"energy supply","score":0.3228194714},{"key-phrase":"aware comprehensive planning","score":0.3150144219},{"key-phrase":"demand estimation","score":0.2923936248},{"key-phrase":"sustainable environmental policy","score":0.2899647951},{"key-phrase":"geospatial localization","score":0.2737420499},{"key-phrase":"analytical hierarchical process","score":0.2701428533},{"key-phrase":"dynamic-based power","score":0.2467978597},{"key-phrase":"data analysis process","score":0.2191107124},{"key-phrase":"territorial dynamic necessitate","score":0.2189725488},{"key-phrase":"data analysis processes","score":0.2102857232},{"key-phrase":"computational infrastructure","score":0.1909773797},{"key-phrase":"operational planning","score":0.1871099472},{"key-phrase":"artificial intelligence","score":0.1855293959},{"key-phrase":"decentralized storage facility","score":0.1728423536},{"key-phrase":"market design","score":0.1705468297},{"key-phrase":"energy","score":0.1697525084},{"key-phrase":"Modelling problem","score":0.1619495004},{"key-phrase":"strategic deployment","score":0.1522621512},{"key-phrase":"anthropogenic activity","score":0.1476463377},{"key-phrase":"data source","score":0.1216413379},{"key-phrase":"mobility pattern","score":0.1209724993},{"key-phrase":"own dynamic nature","score":0.1170222983},{"key-phrase":"consumption","score":0.0975773335},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained energy","score":0.0854970217},{"key-phrase":"research work","score":0.03998008},{"key-phrase":"interrelated work package","score":0.0371372662},{"key-phrase":"end result","score":-0.0493375361},{"key-phrase":"considerable modification","score":-0.0641570538}]},{"Cluster":14,"Score":0.6363618286,"DocId":496,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Urban areas extraction from multi sensor data based on machine learning and data fusion","Abstract":"Accurate urban areas information is important for a variety of applications, especially city planning and natural disaster prediction and management. In recent years, extraction of urban structures from remotely sensed images has been extensively explored. The key advantages of this imaging modality are reduction of surveying expense and time. It also elevates restrictions on ground surveys. Thus far, much research typically extracts these structures from very high resolution satellite imagery, which are unfortunately of relatively poor spectral resolution, resulting in good precision yet moderate accuracy. Therefore, this paper investigates extraction of buildings from middle and high resolution satellite images by using spectral indices (Normalized Difference Building Index: NDBI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: NDVI, Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index: SAVI, Modified Normalized Difference Index: MNDWI, and Global Environment Monitoring Index: GEMI) by means of various Machine Learning methods (Artificial Neural Network: ANN, K-Nearest Neighbor: KNN, and Support Vector Machine: SVM) and Data Fusion (i.e., Majority Voting). Herein empirical results suggested that suitable learning methods for urban areas extraction are in preferring order Data Fusion, SVM, KNN, and ANN.

Monitoring land-cover change is critical to efficient environmental management and urban planning. The current study had two objectives. The first was to compare pixel-based random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifier methods and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm both in pixel-based and object-based approaches for classification of land-cover in a heterogeneous landscape for 2010. The second was to examine spatio-temporal land-cover change over the last two decades (1990\u20132010) using Landsat data. This study found that the object-based SVM classifier is the most accurate with an overall classification accuracy of 93.54% and a kappa value of 0.88. A post-classification change detection algorithm was used to determine the trend of change between land-cover classes. The most significant change from 1990 to 2010 was caused by the expansion of built-up areas. In addition to the net changes, the rate of annual change for each phenomenon was calculated to obtain a better understanding of the process of change. Between 1990 and 2010, an average of 4.53% of lands turned to the built-up annually and there was an annual decrease of about 0.81% in natural land. If the current trend of change continues, regardless of the actions of sustainable development, drastic declines in natural areas will ensue. The results of this study can be a valuable baseline for land-cover managers in the region to better understand the current situation and adopt appropriate strategies for management of land-cover. \u00a9 2017, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Author Keywords":"Decision tree; Land-cover; Object-based; Random forest; Support vector machines","Authors":"Keshtkar H., Voigt W., Alizadeh E.","DOI":"10.1007\/s12517-017-2899-y","x":9.78,"y":-4.14,"KeyPhrases":["random forest","natural land","significant change","Landsat data","cover class"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.4678858221},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.465863049},{"key-phrase":"post-classification change detection","score":0.4622638822},{"key-phrase":"Monitoring land","score":0.462025702},{"key-phrase":"SVM classifier","score":0.4393098652},{"key-phrase":"Landsat data","score":0.4251598716},{"key-phrase":"heterogeneous landscape","score":0.4073781669},{"key-phrase":"classifier method","score":0.3901827931},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3849217892},{"key-phrase":"natural land","score":0.3712405562},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.366481483},{"key-phrase":"spatio-temporal land","score":0.3442794085},{"key-phrase":"overall classification accuracy","score":0.3360376358},{"key-phrase":"natural area","score":0.3152466118},{"key-phrase":"rapid urbanization","score":0.2770457864},{"key-phrase":"sustainable development","score":0.2622727752},{"key-phrase":"environmental issue","score":0.2490842044},{"key-phrase":"efficient environmental management","score":0.2417048514},{"key-phrase":"significant change","score":0.2312582135},{"key-phrase":"annual change","score":0.2227362841},{"key-phrase":"net change","score":0.2131684124},{"key-phrase":"cover class","score":0.204382062},{"key-phrase":"cover change","score":0.1725985408},{"key-phrase":"annual decrease","score":0.1626964211},{"key-phrase":"Frequent human activity","score":0.1353621334},{"key-phrase":"change","score":0.1212002113},{"key-phrase":"kappa value","score":0.1153630093},{"key-phrase":"current trend","score":0.1013332456},{"key-phrase":"cover manager","score":0.0972086787},{"key-phrase":"cover","score":0.0940597951},{"key-phrase":"drastic decline","score":0.0891915709},{"key-phrase":"current situation","score":0.0803949386},{"key-phrase":"valuable baseline","score":0.0739763826},{"key-phrase":"appropriate strategy","score":0.0157612432},{"key-phrase":"current study","score":0.0107992366}]},{"Cluster":22,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":498,"Cited by":36.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Forecasting smog-related health hazard based on social media and physical sensor","Abstract":"Smog disasters are becoming more and more frequent and may cause severe consequences on the environment and public health, especially in urban areas.

The geographic representation of an urban area in Syracuse generated in GIS was converted to the computational domain used in CFD simulation. The flow field around the building was simulated using the CFD model under different wind speeds and directions. Results from CFD simulation could be well presented in GIS using anchored coordinate system. The flow patterns were very similar when the wind speed was varied, while they were highly dependent on the wind directions. However, predicting the flow fields of different wind directions requires running the CFD simulation for each case. A neural network for machine learning was adopted to help predict the microclimate around the building so that much time can be saved.

Urban planning students take courses in statistics, survey research and projection and estimation that are designed to fill in the gaps in this environment. For decades they have learned how to use census data, which is comprehensive on several basic variables, but is only conducted once per decade so is almost always out of date. More detailed population characteristics are based on a sample and are only available in aggregated form for larger geographic areas. But new data sources, including distributed sensors, infrastructure monitoring, remote sensing, social media and cell phone tracking records, can provide much more detailed, individual, real time data at disaggregated levels that can be used at a variety of scales. We have entered a data rich environment, where we can have data on systems and behaviors for more frequent time increments and with a greater number of observations on a greater number of factors (The Age of Big Data, The New York Times, 2012; Now you see it: simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis, Berkeley, 2009). Planners are still being trained in methods that are suitable for a data poor environment (J Plan Educ Res 6:10\u201321, 1986; Analytics over large-scale multidimensional data: the big data revolution!, 101\u2013104, 2011; J Plan Educ Res 15:17\u201333, 1995). In this paper we suggest that visualization, simulation, data mining and machine learning are the appropriate tools to use in this new environment and we discuss how planning education can adapt to this new data rich landscape. We will discuss how these methods can be integrated into the planning curriculum as well as planning practice. \u00a9 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Author Keywords":"Analytics; Big data; Education; Urban planning; Visualization","Authors":"French S.P., Barchers C., Zhang W.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-40902-3_12","x":7.07,"y":-2.77,"KeyPhrases":["Urban planning student","big data revolution","census data","simple visualization technique","data mining"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Urban planning student","score":0.6022126079},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.5468613505},{"key-phrase":"Big Data","score":0.4778540432},{"key-phrase":"big data revolution","score":0.4681761265},{"key-phrase":"planning practice","score":0.4426707327},{"key-phrase":"census data","score":0.4197813272},{"key-phrase":"large-scale multidimensional data","score":0.4152333438},{"key-phrase":"data mining","score":0.3859878182},{"key-phrase":"new data","score":0.3707385957},{"key-phrase":"new data source","score":0.368203938},{"key-phrase":"planning curriculum","score":0.3481625915},{"key-phrase":"detailed population characteristic","score":0.3470467925},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3338720798},{"key-phrase":"survey research","score":0.3073104918},{"key-phrase":"infrastructure monitoring","score":0.2956082225},{"key-phrase":"real time data","score":0.2890423536},{"key-phrase":"quantitative analysis","score":0.2826234102},{"key-phrase":"rich landscape","score":0.2725960016},{"key-phrase":"simple visualization technique","score":0.2718992829},{"key-phrase":"rich environment","score":0.2446167469},{"key-phrase":"geographic area","score":0.2014674991},{"key-phrase":"J Plan Educ","score":0.195609808},{"key-phrase":"cell phone tracking","score":0.180342108},{"key-phrase":"new environment","score":0.1554952264},{"key-phrase":"poor environment","score":0.1377902329},{"key-phrase":"several basic variable","score":0.1347828656},{"key-phrase":"appropriate tool","score":0.1249533147},{"key-phrase":"frequent time increment","score":0.118551895},{"key-phrase":"social medium","score":0.1091555282},{"key-phrase":"educ","score":0.1082608327},{"key-phrase":"New York Times","score":0.0809238106},{"key-phrase":"J","score":0.0230233409}]},{"Cluster":10,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":505,"Cited by":13.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Feature extraction and k-means clustering approach to explore important features of urban identity","Abstract":"Public spaces play an important role in the processes of formation, generation and change of urban identity. Under present day conditions, the identities of cities are rapidly deteriorating and vanishing. Therefore, the importance of urban design, which is a means of designing urban spaces and their physical and social aspects, is ever growing. This paper proposes a novel methodology by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering approach to find important features of the urban identity from public space. K. Lynch's work and Space Syntax theory are reconstructed and integrated with POI (Points of Interest) to quantify the quality of the public space. A case study of Z\u00fcrich city is used to test of these redefinitions and features of urban identity. The results show that PCA and K-means clustering approach can identify the urban identity and explore important features. This strategy could help to improve planning and design processes and generation of new urban patterns with more appropriate features and qualities. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Feature extraction; K-means clustering; Space syntax; Urban identity","Authors":"Chang M.-C., Bus P., Schmitt G.","DOI":"10.1109\/ICMLA.2017.00015","x":7.21,"y":-4.2,"KeyPhrases":["urban space","Principle Component Analysis","design process","means clustering approach","Space Syntax theory"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban space","score":0.5597752333},{"key-phrase":"urban design","score":0.524717629},{"key-phrase":"urban identity","score":0.5100408792},{"key-phrase":"new urban pattern","score":0.5046498775},{"key-phrase":"Principle Component Analysis","score":0.4258611202},{"key-phrase":"means clustering approach","score":0.3853461146},{"key-phrase":"public space","score":0.3775991201},{"key-phrase":"Public spaces","score":0.3663843274},{"key-phrase":"Z\u00fcrich city","score":0.296171546},{"key-phrase":"Space Syntax theory","score":0.2671419382},{"key-phrase":"design process","score":0.2549490333},{"key-phrase":"physical and social aspect","score":0.199087292},{"key-phrase":"novel methodology","score":0.1719730943},{"key-phrase":"important feature","score":0.1530010402},{"key-phrase":"identity","score":0.1253321171},{"key-phrase":"means","score":0.1081282273},{"key-phrase":"appropriate feature","score":0.0838204771},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0836595744},{"key-phrase":"Lynch's work","score":0.0802953541},{"key-phrase":"present day condition","score":0.0692569092},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.0685738921}]},{"Cluster":28,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":506,"Cited by":9.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"NLOS multipath detection by using machine learning in urban environments","Abstract":"In global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning, GNSS satellites are often obstructed by buildings, leading to reflected and diffracted signals, which are known as non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals. These cause major positioning (also known as \"NLOS multipath\") errors in GNSS positioning. This paper proposes a novel NLOS multipath detection technique that uses a machine-learning technique to improve positioning accuracy in urban environments. The key idea behind this technique is to construct a classifier that discriminates NLOS multipath signals from the output of the multiple GNSS signal correlators of a software GNSS receiver. In the code-tracking process within GNSS receivers, the code correlation peak is determined and tracked using the outputs of the signal correlators. In the case of an NLOS signal, there are no direct signals; the first reflected signal has low power compared to the direct signal. Hence, the correlation function is expected to be more distorted in the case of NLOS signal correlation. We use this phenomenon to detect NLOS signals. For realizing machine learning, we extract the features of the NLOS signal from the shape of the NLOS correlation function, using an actual dataset, to construct an NLOS classifier. To evaluate the proposed technique, we conduct NLOS classification experiments using signal correlation data acquired at different locations in the Shinjuku area of Japan. We propose to construct an NLOS classifier based on a support vector machine. From the experiments, 87% of the LOS signals and 99% of the NLOS signals are correctly discriminated.

They have highly improved in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions and by the sheer volume of collected images, the necessity of simplification of automation in feature extraction. Road data play a key role in urban planning, traffic management, military applications, and vehicle navigation as well as for decision making in numerous applications. The faster updation of road infrastructure is a need because the technology has brought map in the hands of people in the form of mobile phones and tablets. Road detection is one of the major issues of the road infrastructure extraction. Its accuracy depends on the type of methodology used. An attempt is made here to analyse the first order, the co-occurrence texture features and image transforms useful for discriminating roads from other features specially the buildings. The identified dataset forms high dimension feature space and the Support Vector Machine is a theoretically superior machine learning methodology with great results in classification of high dimensional datasets. In the past, SVMs have been tested and evaluated only as pixel-based image classifiers. Moving from pixel-based techniques towards object-based representation, the dimensions of remote sensing imagery feature space increases significantly. An SVM approach for classification was followed, based on primitive image objects produces by a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. The SVM procedure produced the final object classification results which were compared to the Nearest Neighbor classifier results and were found to give better results in OBIA domain. \u00a9 2017 ACRS.

It could affect adverse effect on the urban resident's life quality and health. However, road traffic noise is being managed after it has affected urban residents, because it could not managed at urban planning stage. Therefore, reactive-management of road traffic noise, such as noise barrier is chosen as noise control plan, but it is costly than proactive-management. When road traffic noise could be considered as urban planning factor, the cost will be reduced. Machine learning method, such as regression analysis, decision tree and artificial neural network, could be used to analyze the relationship between variables. This method was used to analyze relationship between road traffic noise and urban form indicators. Predicted noise level of road traffic noise at building facade was used as output variable, and urban form indicators are used as input variable. Applicable urban form indicators could be divided into population-related, building-related, traffic-related and land-use-related.

Land planning has a positive impact on the development of residential land but negatively affects the expansion of industrial, commercial and mining land, that is to say, the plot planned for construction land has a lower probability of transforming into construction land, which is not in line with common sense, indicating that the compilation of the land planning is far from the expansion of actual construction land. Therefore, this paper presents the urban inefficient industrial land recognition system based on augmented learning model. We adopt endogenous optimization method to determine the weight of each input factor, do not need to estimate parameters in advance, no correlation requirement to input and output variables, avoiding the input-output relationship of the expression and the index weight to determine the specific functional form of subjectivity. With this model, the urban planning model is then optimized to satisfy the general requirements.","Author Keywords":"Augmented learning; Inefficient industrial; Land recognition; Machine learning; Urban","Authors":"Rao Y., Dai D.","DOI":null,"x":8.49,"y":-3.06,"KeyPhrases":["inefficient industrial land recognition","endogenous optimization method","urban planning model","index weight","output relationship"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"inefficient industrial land recognition","score":0.6100259423},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.4646312594},{"key-phrase":"Land planning","score":0.4517893493},{"key-phrase":"urban planning model","score":0.443269372},{"key-phrase":"industrial and commercial land","score":0.4182156324},{"key-phrase":"construction land","score":0.4054900408},{"key-phrase":"learning model","score":0.3841647804},{"key-phrase":"residential land","score":0.3778779805},{"key-phrase":"actual construction land","score":0.3727895021},{"key-phrase":"endogenous optimization method","score":0.3394202292},{"key-phrase":"land","score":0.2636376619},{"key-phrase":"output relationship","score":0.2280884087},{"key-phrase":"index weight","score":0.1696151495},{"key-phrase":"industrial","score":0.1686951816},{"key-phrase":"input factor","score":0.1596941054},{"key-phrase":"output variable","score":0.1323939711},{"key-phrase":"correlation requirement","score":0.1204622537},{"key-phrase":"specific functional form","score":0.1006945744},{"key-phrase":"common sense","score":0.0872177407},{"key-phrase":"positive impact","score":0.0637784079},{"key-phrase":"general requirement","score":0.0395817682},{"key-phrase":"salient point","score":0.0329927355},{"key-phrase":"significant impact","score":0.0295803696}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":510,"Cited by":null,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"1st Asia-Pacific Web and Web-Age Information Management Joint Conference on Web and Big Data, APWeb-WAIM 2017 held in Conjuction with the International Workshop on Mobile Web Data Analytics, MWDA 2017, International Workshop on Hot Topics in Big Spatial Data and Urban Computing, HotSpatial 2017, International Workshop on Graph Data Management and Analysis, GDMA 2017, 2nd International Workshop on Data Driven Crowdsourcing, DDC 2017, 2nd International Workshop on Spatio-temporal Data Management and Analytics, SDMA 2017 and International Workshop on Mobility Analytics from Spatial and Social Data, MASS 2017","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 25 papers.

A lot of rich information comes in textual forms, which traditionally have to be read manually. With advancements in machine learning capabilities, there is potential to tap on it to aid planners in synthesizing insights from large amount of textual feedback data more efficiently. In this paper, we developed a more general urban-centric feedback analysis framework, which encompasses the spatio-temporal thematic of ground sensing. Three essential methods: geotagging, topic modeling, and trend analysis are proposed and a prototype has been implemented. The results of experiments indicate that the proposed framework could not only accurately extract precise geospatial information, but also efficiently analyze the semantic themes based on a probabilistic topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Importantly, the spatial and temporal trends of detected topics indicate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and then benefit domain experts in their routine work and reveal many interesting insights on ground sensing matters. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Author Keywords":"Geotagging; Spatio-temporal analysis; Topic modeling; Urban planning","Authors":"Chen G., Yu L., Ng W.S., Wu H., Kunasegaran U.N.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-69179-4_56","x":5.91,"y":-3.38,"KeyPhrases":["topic modeling","Urban planning","textual feedback data","spatial and temporal trend","urban-centric feedback"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"topic modeling","score":0.5603432655},{"key-phrase":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation","score":0.5496921539},{"key-phrase":"probabilistic topic modeling","score":0.5379917622},{"key-phrase":"urban-centric feedback","score":0.4527190328},{"key-phrase":"Urban planning","score":0.4427993298},{"key-phrase":"textual feedback data","score":0.4118923545},{"key-phrase":"precise geospatial information","score":0.3736711144},{"key-phrase":"spatial and temporal trend","score":0.3249781132},{"key-phrase":"semantic theme","score":0.3233472407},{"key-phrase":"rich information","score":0.3192335367},{"key-phrase":"trend analysis","score":0.2540666163},{"key-phrase":"textual","score":0.2069291472},{"key-phrase":"textual form","score":0.1887097359},{"key-phrase":"feedback","score":0.1679171771},{"key-phrase":"machine learning capability","score":0.164068386},{"key-phrase":"many interesting insight","score":0.1501480937},{"key-phrase":"analysis framework","score":0.1481256485},{"key-phrase":"domain expert","score":0.1337664574},{"key-phrase":"various stakeholder","score":0.1212310195},{"key-phrase":"large amount","score":0.0605185293},{"key-phrase":"routine work","score":0.0360102579},{"key-phrase":"essential method","score":-0.0015213857}]},{"Cluster":21,"Score":0.8613670192,"DocId":512,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"An Evaluation Index for Cross Ventilation Based on CFD Simulations and Ventilation Prediction Model Using Machine Learning algorithms","Abstract":"High-density cities usually surfer deterioration of the urban built environment due to slow or stagnant air movement. This deterioration could be mitigated by improved urban natural ventilation through good urban planning and building design. However, indoor natural ventilation requirements in current building standards only define absolute indoor air speed without considering outdoor conditions. To fill this gap, this paper developed generic urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor CFD models and proposes a new integrated index (CIOI index) to evaluate indoor natural ventilation potential, which couples both indoor and outdoor wind environments. CIOIv regression models are developed by applying machine learning algorithms based on 3,840 CFD simulation results. The Gradient Boosting (GB) model shows an improved performance in terms of higher correlation (R2=0.8) and lower errors (MAPE=16%) compared with the multivariate linear regression model. Building designers and urban planners can use this CIOI prediction model to quickly check, in the early design stage, the influence of their design variations on indoor ventilation potential. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

In this article, I test the hypothesis whether configurational (syntactic) properties of an urban street network are relevant for the location of land use. If syntactic features are relevant, then land use types may have a 'syntactic signature'. To identify this blueprint, I apply machine-learning techniques to datasets of syntactic measures, for ten business types. The results are ten models, each with the syntactic blueprint of a type of business. The models are used to predict the existence, or not, of such businesses in segments of the map of London. The performance of the models varies, with fifty per cent reaching statistical significance, including one with 'good' prediction ability. The models for Starbucks coffee shops and solicitor's offices have the strongest prediction ability. The exploratory exercise demonstrates the potential of the machine-learning method Random Forests, when supervised and individually applied to a business activity, to identify the syntactic signature of business types. Such models can be used during planning and design and on location studies. The results strengthen the candidacy of syntactic measurements to location-decision-making. Moreover, they reinforce the theory of Natural Movement.","Author Keywords":"Land use; Machine-learning; Random forest; Space syntax; Spatial configuration; Urban planning.","Authors":"Silva J.P.","DOI":null,"x":6.5500001907,"y":5.0399999619,"KeyPhrases":["land use type","syntactic blueprint","urban street network","Natural Movement postulates","prediction ability"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land use type","score":0.463208884},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.4458744228},{"key-phrase":"space syntax Theory","score":0.4045370221},{"key-phrase":"syntactic feature","score":0.4016108513},{"key-phrase":"syntactic","score":0.3828275204},{"key-phrase":"syntactic measurement","score":0.3789567947},{"key-phrase":"urban street network","score":0.3788363039},{"key-phrase":"location study","score":0.3746869564},{"key-phrase":"syntactic blueprint","score":0.3660641909},{"key-phrase":"syntactic measure","score":0.3643964529},{"key-phrase":"syntactic signature","score":0.3635637164},{"key-phrase":"business type","score":0.2995430529},{"key-phrase":"business activity","score":0.2742743492},{"key-phrase":"Natural Movement postulates","score":0.2694529295},{"key-phrase":"street network","score":0.2619328797},{"key-phrase":"learning method Random","score":0.2358971089},{"key-phrase":"prediction ability","score":0.2321531773},{"key-phrase":"Natural Movement","score":0.2061680257},{"key-phrase":"business","score":0.1973263174},{"key-phrase":"Starbucks coffee shop","score":0.1896896064},{"key-phrase":"solicitor's office","score":0.1722180247},{"key-phrase":"statistical significance","score":0.1699550152},{"key-phrase":"such business","score":0.1657503098},{"key-phrase":"Such model","score":0.1481234431},{"key-phrase":"exploratory exercise","score":0.1436176598},{"key-phrase":"per cent","score":0.1148860902}]},{"Cluster":26,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":514,"Cited by":2.0,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Applicability of support vector machines in landslide susceptibility mapping","Abstract":"Landslides in Slovakia are followed by great economic loss and threat to human life. Therefore, implementation of landslides susceptibility models is essential in urban planning. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the possible applicability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in landslides susceptibility prediction.

A spatial database of landslides areas and geologically stable areas from the State Geological Institute of Dion\u00fdz \u0160t\u00far were used to fit SVMs models. Four environmental input parameters, land use, lithology, aspect and slope were used to train support vector machines models. During the training phase, the primal objective was to find optimal sets of kernel parameters by grid search. The linear, polynomial and radial basis function kernels were computed. Together 534 models were trained and tested with LIBLINEAR and LIBSVM libraries. Models were evaluated by Accuracy parameter. Then the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and landslides susceptibility maps were produced for the best model for every kernel. The best predictive performance was gained by radial basis function kernel. This kernel has also the best generalization ability. The results showed that SVMs employed in the presented study gave promising results with more than 0.90 (the area under the ROC curve (AUC) prediction performance. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Author Keywords":"Landslide susceptibility; Machine learning; Receiver operating characteristic; Support vector machines; Validation","Authors":"Karell L., Mu\u0148ko M., \u010eura\u010diov\u00e1 R.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-319-45123-7_27","x":13.1099996567,"y":3.5799999237,"KeyPhrases":["landslides susceptibility prediction","support vector machine","urban planning","Accuracy parameter","Kysuck\u00e9 Nov\u00e9 Mesto"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"landslides susceptibility prediction","score":0.6771020889},{"key-phrase":"landslides susceptibility map","score":0.5826957226},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.564411521},{"key-phrase":"landslide susceptibility model","score":0.5382121205},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machines","score":0.5182988644},{"key-phrase":"SVMs algorithms","score":0.5131719112},{"key-phrase":"SVMs model","score":0.4994919896},{"key-phrase":"svms","score":0.4981630445},{"key-phrase":"landslide area","score":0.472949028},{"key-phrase":"ROC curve","score":0.335252434},{"key-phrase":"classification problem","score":0.3089603782},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2861845493},{"key-phrase":"prediction performance","score":0.252199918},{"key-phrase":"LIBSVM library","score":0.2520659566},{"key-phrase":"Accuracy parameter","score":0.2485877723},{"key-phrase":"predictive performance","score":0.2373373955},{"key-phrase":"spatial database","score":0.2322419733},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.2282031327},{"key-phrase":"radial basis function","score":0.2248154879},{"key-phrase":"polynomial and radial basis function","score":0.1965453625},{"key-phrase":"generalization ability","score":0.1941170245},{"key-phrase":"kernel parameter","score":0.1816591173},{"key-phrase":"stable area","score":0.1797784865},{"key-phrase":"State Geological Institute","score":0.1558708847},{"key-phrase":"grid search","score":0.1296165138},{"key-phrase":"kernel","score":0.1085191444},{"key-phrase":"Kysuck\u00e9 Nov\u00e9 Mesto","score":0.106638521},{"key-phrase":"possible applicability","score":0.0992335528},{"key-phrase":"district Byt\u010da","score":0.0876432285},{"key-phrase":"training phase","score":0.0611681119},{"key-phrase":"environmental input parameter","score":0.0306100845},{"key-phrase":"promising result","score":0.025561925},{"key-phrase":"optimal set","score":0.0245502237},{"key-phrase":"great economic loss","score":0.0150122941},{"key-phrase":"Dion\u00fdz \u0160t\u00far","score":0.0096345488},{"key-phrase":"primal objective","score":0.0058175977},{"key-phrase":"main purpose","score":-0.0341468155},{"key-phrase":"human life","score":-0.0495573878}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":515,"Cited by":null,"Year":2017,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Algorithm for modeling agricultural land cover classification and land surface temperature","Abstract":"The rampant and unintended spread of urban areas resulted to the increase artificial component in the land cover types of the countryside bringing forth urban heat island (UHI). This paved the way to wide range of negative influences on the human health and environment which commonly relates to air pollution, drought, higher energy demand, and water shortage. The land cover also plays a relevant role in the process of understanding the interaction between ground surfaces with the local temperature. At the moment, depiction of the land surface temperature (LST) at city\/municipality scale particularly in certain areas of Misamis Oriental, Philippines is inadequate as support to efficient mitigations and adaptations of the surface urban heat island (SUHI). Thus, this study purposely attempts to provide application on the Landsat 8 satellite data and low density Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) products in mapping out quality semi-Automated LST model and crop-level land cover classification in a local scale through theoretical and algorithm base approach utilizing the principle of data analysis subjected to object based model. The paper also aims to explore the relationship between the derived LST and land cover classification. The results of the presented model showed the ability of comprehensive data analysis, GIS functionalities and object based image analysis (OBIA) approach with the integration of machine learning intelligence on automating complex map production processes with considerable efficiency and high accuracy. The findings may potentially lead to expanded investigation of temporal dynamics of land surface UHI.

As a result, it can aid in facilitating problem identification, support mitigations and adaptations more efficiently. \u00a9 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In addition to direct peer-to-peer comparisons, the benchmarking data published under these laws have been used as a tool by researchers and policy-makers to study the distribution and determinants of energy use in large buildings. However, these policies only cover a small subset of the building stock in a given city, and thus capture only a fraction of energy use at the urban scale. To overcome this limitation, we develop a predictive model of energy use at the building, district, and city scales using training data from energy disclosure policies and predictors from widely-available property and zoning information. We use statistical models to predict the energy use of 1.1\u00a0million buildings in New York City using the physical, spatial, and energy use attributes of a subset derived from 23,000 buildings required to report energy use data each year. Linear regression (OLS), random forest, and support vector regression (SVM) algorithms are fit to the city's energy benchmarking data and then used to predict electricity and natural gas use for every property in the city. Model accuracy is assessed and validated at the building level and zip code level using actual consumption data from calendar year 2014. We find the OLS model performs best when generalizing to the City as a whole, and SVM results in the lowest mean absolute error for predicting energy use within the LL84 sample. Our median predicted electric energy use intensity for office buildings is 71.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf and for residential buildings is 31.2\u00a0kbtu\/sf with mean absolute log accuracy ratio of 0.17. Building age is found to be a significant predictor of energy use, with newer buildings (particularly those built since 1991) found to have higher consumption levels than those constructed before 1930. We also find higher electric consumption in office and retail buildings, although the sign is reversed for natural gas. In general, larger buildings use less energy per square foot, while taller buildings with more stories, controlling for floor area, use more energy per square foot. Attached buildings \u2013 those with adjacent buildings and a shared party wall \u2013 are found to have lower natural gas use intensity. The results demonstrate that electricity consumption can be reliably predicted using actual data from a relatively small subset of buildings, while natural gas use presents a more complicated problem given the bimodal distribution of consumption and infrastructure availability. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Building energy; Energy efficiency; Energy prediction; Machine learning; Urban dynamics","Authors":"Kontokosta C.E., Tull C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.apenergy.2017.04.005","x":3.9000000954,"y":4.0399999619,"KeyPhrases":["city's energy benchmarking","support vector regression","residential building","energy disclosure policy","actual data"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"city's energy benchmarking","score":0.5668531656},{"key-phrase":"energy use data","score":0.5360173583},{"key-phrase":"energy efficiency market","score":0.5027077794},{"key-phrase":"electricity consumption","score":0.4277229011},{"key-phrase":"energy use attribute","score":0.4232113957},{"key-phrase":"energy use","score":0.4181141853},{"key-phrase":"support vector regression","score":0.4151895046},{"key-phrase":"electric consumption","score":0.4012162685},{"key-phrase":"energy disclosure policy","score":0.3886405826},{"key-phrase":"residential building","score":0.3758762479},{"key-phrase":"energy disclosure","score":0.3702042997},{"key-phrase":"electric energy use","score":0.3687961102},{"key-phrase":"random forest","score":0.3666523695},{"key-phrase":"actual consumption data","score":0.3595457077},{"key-phrase":"predictive model","score":0.3461339474},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.3409073651},{"key-phrase":"retail building","score":0.3224199116},{"key-phrase":"office building","score":0.3160878122},{"key-phrase":"building","score":0.315340966},{"key-phrase":"natural gas use","score":0.3128254712},{"key-phrase":"Linear regression","score":0.3114705086},{"key-phrase":"large building","score":0.3089358807},{"key-phrase":"zoning information","score":0.3065708876},{"key-phrase":"building level","score":0.3027270436},{"key-phrase":"carbon reduction plan","score":0.2861132026},{"key-phrase":"square foot","score":0.2780696154},{"key-phrase":"urban scale","score":0.2769243121},{"key-phrase":"adjacent building","score":0.2649926245},{"key-phrase":"significant predictor","score":0.2478242517},{"key-phrase":"city scale","score":0.2396065891},{"key-phrase":"OLS model","score":0.2378272116},{"key-phrase":"consumption level","score":0.2370188534},{"key-phrase":"statistical model","score":0.2342362702},{"key-phrase":"natural gas","score":0.2340334952},{"key-phrase":"Model accuracy","score":0.2282247245},{"key-phrase":"floor area","score":0.2261902094},{"key-phrase":"benchmarking data","score":0.2212715447},{"key-phrase":"actual data","score":0.2187289298},{"key-phrase":"energy","score":0.2186268866},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.2143913805},{"key-phrase":"zip code level","score":0.20317927},{"key-phrase":"Many city","score":0.1954750717},{"key-phrase":"mean absolute log accuracy","score":0.1829591841},{"key-phrase":"peer comparison","score":0.1182647645},{"key-phrase":"building stock","score":0.1025372893},{"key-phrase":"available property","score":0.1021353602},{"key-phrase":"LL84 sample","score":0.0955187008},{"key-phrase":"party wall","score":0.0884952322},{"key-phrase":"mean absolute error","score":0.0820301026},{"key-phrase":"United States","score":0.0707690865},{"key-phrase":"infrastructure availability","score":0.0639816001},{"key-phrase":"calendar year","score":0.0612313636},{"key-phrase":"small subset","score":0.0579968616},{"key-phrase":"complicated problem","score":0.0438054167},{"key-phrase":"direct peer","score":0.0071627572},{"key-phrase":"bimodal distribution","score":-0.0068675992}]},{"Cluster":28,"Score":0.8016268366,"DocId":518,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Machine learning for source localization in urban environments","Abstract":"This paper investigates source localization in urban environments using machine learning methods. Both classification and regression schemes are examined using the random forest algorithm. In both approaches, the localization performance depends mostly on arrival time information of received signals. It is shown that the use of a relative arrival time difference rather than the direct time of arrival (TOA) also provide good performance, which is beneficial for practical application. It is found that with enough number of receivers, the signal power parameter can be omitted, which eliminates frequency dependency of developed models. It is also found that at least three receivers should be used to achieve acceptable prediction performance. Additionally, the number of training examples needed depends on the approach used as well as the desired level of accuracy. This factor is more important in the classification approach, as the amount of training data required closely relates to the number of sectors created by the localization problem. A regression scheme is more natural for predicting spatial coordinate values, and achieved higher localization accuracy with fewer training examples as compared to classification. Ultimately, the regression based localization scheme using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) parameter at three receiver locations achieved an average localization accuracy of 2.8m. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; ray tracing; source localization; urban environments","Authors":"Bibb D.A., Yun Z., Iskander M.F.","DOI":"10.1109\/MILCOM.2016.7795360","x":3.4700000286,"y":1.4900000095,"KeyPhrases":["random forest algorithm","receiver location","urban environment","average localization accuracy","relative arrival time"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"random forest algorithm","score":0.4844532311},{"key-phrase":"localization accuracy","score":0.4637442827},{"key-phrase":"receiver location","score":0.4576519132},{"key-phrase":"average localization accuracy","score":0.391727984},{"key-phrase":"machine learning method","score":0.374504149},{"key-phrase":"source localization","score":0.3575900793},{"key-phrase":"localization performance","score":0.3296206295},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3101491332},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.2992793918},{"key-phrase":"arrival time information","score":0.2910395861},{"key-phrase":"relative arrival time","score":0.2901043892},{"key-phrase":"regression scheme","score":0.2427567244},{"key-phrase":"localization","score":0.2397362292},{"key-phrase":"localization scheme","score":0.2281840742},{"key-phrase":"classification approach","score":0.2176989615},{"key-phrase":"training example","score":0.2171671093},{"key-phrase":"localization problem","score":0.2144937515},{"key-phrase":"acceptable prediction performance","score":0.1981303692},{"key-phrase":"spatial coordinate value","score":0.1805903614},{"key-phrase":"signal power parameter","score":0.145813778},{"key-phrase":"time difference","score":0.1449007392},{"key-phrase":"direct time","score":0.1186177135},{"key-phrase":"practical application","score":0.1008212641},{"key-phrase":"arrival","score":0.0911304429},{"key-phrase":"good performance","score":0.0780769885},{"key-phrase":"enough number","score":0.0631520525},{"key-phrase":"frequency dependency","score":0.0502672493}]},{"Cluster":3,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":519,"Cited by":12.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Joint prediction of road-Traffic and parking occupancy over a city with representation learning","Abstract":"As journey planning services begins to include real time traffic forecast features in order to compute more accurate routing along the journey, adaptive traffic control systems can also benefit from this prediction so as to minimize traffic congestion.

In this work, we particularly focus on the complex relationship between land-use and transport offering an innovative approach to the problem by using land-use features at two differing levels of granularity (the more general land-use sector types and the more granular amenity structures) to evaluate their impact on public transit ridership in both time and space. To quantify the interdependencies, we explored three machine learning models and demonstrate that the decision tree model performs best in terms of overall performance-good predictive accuracy, generality, computational efficiency, and \"interpretability\". Results also reveal that amenity-related features are better predictors than the more general ones, which suggests that high-resolution geo-information can provide more insights into the dependence of transit ridership on land-use. We then demonstrate how the developed framework can be applied to urban planning for transit-oriented development by exploring practicable scenarios based on Singapore's urban plan toward 2030, which includes the development of \"regional centers\" (RCs) across the city-state. Results show an initial increase in transit ridership as the amount of amenities is increased. This trend, on the other hand, eventually reverses (particularly during peak hours) with continued strategic increase in amenities; a tipping point at 55% increase is identified where ridership begins to decline and at 110%, the predicted ridership begins to fall below current levels. Our in-silico experiments support one of the medium-term land-use transport goals of stakeholders-to alleviate future strains in the transportation system of Singapore through the development of RCs. The model put forward can serve as a good foundation in building decision-support tools that can assist planners in better strategizing and planning land-use configurations, in particular the amenity resource distribution, to influence and shape public transportation demand. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Author Keywords":"Amenities; Land use; Public transit; Urban planning","Authors":"Hu N., Legara E.F., Lee K.K., Hung G.G., Monterola C.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landusepol.2016.06.004","x":12.8599996567,"y":1.2999999523,"KeyPhrases":["urban planning","transit ridership","decision tree model","use feature","overall performance"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.5358587503},{"key-phrase":"public transit ridership","score":0.49607566},{"key-phrase":"transit ridership","score":0.4917729497},{"key-phrase":"urban plan","score":0.4893313646},{"key-phrase":"public transportation demand","score":0.4779727757},{"key-phrase":"machine learning model","score":0.3922536671},{"key-phrase":"transportation system","score":0.390996784},{"key-phrase":"decision tree model","score":0.3875898123},{"key-phrase":"ridership","score":0.3746571541},{"key-phrase":"other city component","score":0.3623298705},{"key-phrase":"term land","score":0.2822486758},{"key-phrase":"granular amenity structure","score":0.2779606283},{"key-phrase":"good predictive accuracy","score":0.2771647573},{"key-phrase":"amenity resource distribution","score":0.2635755539},{"key-phrase":"use transport goal","score":0.2187521905},{"key-phrase":"Various land","score":0.2185047567},{"key-phrase":"general land","score":0.1845247149},{"key-phrase":"use feature","score":0.1778334528},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution geo","score":0.1718534529},{"key-phrase":"amenity","score":0.1568989754},{"key-phrase":"regional center","score":0.1558101028},{"key-phrase":"peak hour","score":0.149751693},{"key-phrase":"computational efficiency","score":0.1400537789},{"key-phrase":"overall performance","score":0.1338650435},{"key-phrase":"strategic increase","score":0.1248889565},{"key-phrase":"complex relationship","score":0.1144711897},{"key-phrase":"use configuration","score":0.1097248271},{"key-phrase":"use sector type","score":0.1093135402},{"key-phrase":"initial increase","score":0.0995110571},{"key-phrase":"support tool","score":0.0926357955},{"key-phrase":"practicable scenario","score":0.0764765069},{"key-phrase":"current level","score":0.0613708384},{"key-phrase":"innovative approach","score":0.0451200008},{"key-phrase":"good foundation","score":0.0338184014},{"key-phrase":"experiment support","score":0.0327056348},{"key-phrase":"future strain","score":0.0316099524},{"key-phrase":"other hand","score":-0.0260233637}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":522,"Cited by":17.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Automated urban travel interpretation: A bottom-up approach for trajectory segmentation","Abstract":"Understanding travel behavior is critical for an effective urban planning as well as for enabling various context-aware service provisions to support mobility as a service (MaaS). Both applications rely on the sensor traces generated by travellers\u2019 smartphones. These traces can be used to interpret travel modes, both for generating automated travel diaries as well as for real-time travel mode detection. Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also, segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the location traces. In order to address all these challenges a novel, state based bottom-up approach is proposed. This approach assumes a fixed atomic segment of a homogeneous state, instead of an event-based segment, and a progressive iteration until a new state is found. The research investigates how an atomic state-based approach can be developed in such a way that can work in real time, near-real time and offline mode and in different environmental conditions with their varying quality of sensor traces. The results show the proposed bottom-up model outperforms the existing event-based segmentation models in terms of adaptivity, flexibility, accuracy and richness in information delivery pertinent to automated travel behavior interpretation. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Author Keywords":"Activity; Context; GPS; IMU; MaaS; Machine learning; Temporal calculi; Trajectory; Trip","Authors":"Das R.D., Winter S.","DOI":"10.3390\/s16111962","x":5.48,"y":-2.87,"KeyPhrases":["travel behavior interpretation","atomic segment","aware service provision","activity transition","sensor trace"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"travel behavior interpretation","score":0.5840052366},{"key-phrase":"travel behavior","score":0.428401202},{"key-phrase":"real-time travel","score":0.4032948017},{"key-phrase":"travel mode","score":0.3948791623},{"key-phrase":"activity transition","score":0.3768637776},{"key-phrase":"location trace","score":0.3620269895},{"key-phrase":"segmentation model","score":0.3605998158},{"key-phrase":"segmentation approach","score":0.35509938},{"key-phrase":"travel diary","score":0.3234182},{"key-phrase":"segment","score":0.3223124146},{"key-phrase":"real time interpretation","score":0.3086429536},{"key-phrase":"atomic state","score":0.2835966349},{"key-phrase":"sensor trace","score":0.2778905332},{"key-phrase":"aware service provision","score":0.2695416212},{"key-phrase":"atomic segment","score":0.2682953477},{"key-phrase":"trace","score":0.2562866211},{"key-phrase":"Current approach segment","score":0.2496586591},{"key-phrase":"mode detection","score":0.2320616543},{"key-phrase":"effective urban planning","score":0.229928717},{"key-phrase":"open-ended segment","score":0.2071410716},{"key-phrase":"information delivery","score":0.1676607728},{"key-phrase":"progressive iteration","score":0.1597580016},{"key-phrase":"homogeneous state","score":0.1568291187},{"key-phrase":"real time","score":0.1471289992},{"key-phrase":"new state","score":0.1415284425},{"key-phrase":"frequent gap","score":0.1344698668},{"key-phrase":"certain criterion","score":0.1242621616},{"key-phrase":"various context","score":0.1220789999},{"key-phrase":"different environmental condition","score":0.1166087389},{"key-phrase":"significant vagueness","score":0.1056363806},{"key-phrase":"up model","score":0.0963059217},{"key-phrase":"up approach","score":0.0829492807}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":523,"Cited by":97.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Measuring visual enclosure for street walkability: Using machine learning algorithms and Google Street View imagery","Abstract":"One major limitation currently with studying street level urban design qualities for walkability is the often inconsistent and unreliable measures of streetscape features across different field surveyors even with costly training due to lack of more objective processes, which also make large scale study difficult.

In the last two decades, a large variety of methods on automatic building detection have been proposed in the remote sensing literature. Many of these approaches make use of local features to classify each pixel or segment to an object label, therefore involving an extra step to fuse pixelwise decisions. This paper presents a generic framework that exploits recent advances in image segmentation and region descriptors extraction for the automatic and accurate detection of buildings on aerial orthophotos. The proposed solution is supervised in the sense that appearances of buildings are learnt from examples. For the first time in the context of building detection, we use the matrix covariance descriptor, which proves to be very informative and compact. Moreover, we introduce a principled evaluation that allows selecting the best pair segmentation algorithm-region descriptor for the task of building detection. Finally, we provide a performance evaluation at pixel level using different classifiers. This evaluation is conducted over 200 buildings using different segmentation algorithms and descriptors. The performance analysis quantifies the quality of both the image segmentation and the descriptor used. The proposed approach presents several advantages in terms of scalability, suitability and simplicity with respect to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme (detection chain and evaluation) can be deployed for detecting multiple object categories that are present in images and can be used by intelligent systems requiring scene perception and parsing such as intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle navigation and automatic 3D city modeling. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The smart navigation employs an on line traffic simulator which provides traffic predictions and improves the accuracy of existing navigation systems which rely on limited traffic data. The intelligent parking assist system predicts the availability of parking at the start of the journey and these predictions get updated as the destination is approached. The system uses machine learning to understand the habits and preferences of the individual driver so that the preferred parking availability information is presented to the driver. The driver diagnostics part learns the driving characteristics of the driver i.e. whether aggressive, semi aggressive or passive, reaction times, following distances etc. and provides this information to the smart navigation and parking assist system for better estimation of travel times. In addition, it can be used to support collision warnings and other driver assist devices.

Automatic and efficient methods for semantic labelling of airborne urban point cloud data with multiple classes still remains a challenge. We propose a novel 3D object-based classification framework for labelling urban lidar point cloud using a computer vision technique, supervoxels. The supervoxel approach is promising for representing dense lidar point cloud in a compact manner for 3D segmentation and for improving the computational efficiency. Initially, supervoxels are generated by over-segmenting the coloured point cloud using the voxel-based cloud connectivity algorithm in the geometric space. The local connectivity established between supervoxels has been used to produce meaningful and realistic objects (segments). The segments are classified by different machine learning techniques based on several spectral and geometric features extracted from the segments. All the points within a labelled segment are assigned the same segment label. Furthermore, the effect of different feature vectors and varying point density on the classification accuracy has been studied. Results indicate an accurate labelling of points in realistic 3D space conforming to the boundaries of objects. An overall classification accuracy of 90% is achieved by the proposed method. The labelled 3D points can be used directly for the reconstruction of buildings and other man-made objects. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Ramiya A.M., Nidamanuri R.R., Ramakrishnan K.","DOI":"10.1080\/01431161.2016.1211348","x":9.14,"y":-5.14,"KeyPhrases":["airborne urban point cloud","semantic labelling","3D segmentation","supervoxel approach","spectral and geometric feature"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"airborne urban point cloud","score":0.6289236546},{"key-phrase":"urban lidar point","score":0.6205645204},{"key-phrase":"point cloud labelling","score":0.6176049709},{"key-phrase":"airborne lidar","score":0.5844349861},{"key-phrase":"dense lidar point","score":0.5580196381},{"key-phrase":"3D segmentation","score":0.4902201891},{"key-phrase":"coloured point cloud","score":0.4625570476},{"key-phrase":"3D point","score":0.3604602516},{"key-phrase":"urban city modelling","score":0.3572651744},{"key-phrase":"realistic 3D space","score":0.3371353447},{"key-phrase":"semantic labelling","score":0.3121914268},{"key-phrase":"point density","score":0.3071206212},{"key-phrase":"cloud","score":0.2887513041},{"key-phrase":"novel 3D object","score":0.2858745456},{"key-phrase":"accurate labelling","score":0.2810464799},{"key-phrase":"spectral and geometric feature","score":0.23794429},{"key-phrase":"meaningful and realistic object","score":0.2333254814},{"key-phrase":"computer vision technique","score":0.2228167951},{"key-phrase":"supervoxel approach","score":0.2214308083},{"key-phrase":"light detection","score":0.2171345353},{"key-phrase":"classification accuracy","score":0.2089517415},{"key-phrase":"geometric space","score":0.2042695284},{"key-phrase":"cloud connectivity algorithm","score":0.1986063421},{"key-phrase":"same segment label","score":0.185895741},{"key-phrase":"classification framework","score":0.1777938306},{"key-phrase":"overall classification accuracy","score":0.172357589},{"key-phrase":"different feature vector","score":0.1698112786},{"key-phrase":"point","score":0.1390264332},{"key-phrase":"multiple class","score":0.13129884},{"key-phrase":"local connectivity","score":0.1189747378},{"key-phrase":"computational efficiency","score":0.0581223182},{"key-phrase":"different machine","score":0.0550307706},{"key-phrase":"efficient method","score":0.0492969751},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0480821505},{"key-phrase":"promising application","score":0.047839731},{"key-phrase":"other man","score":0.0094634136},{"key-phrase":"compact manner","score":-0.0272538848}]},{"Cluster":8,"Score":0.8054316124,"DocId":529,"Cited by":11.0,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"On urban soundscape mapping: A computer can predict the outcome of soundscape assessments","Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a computer may predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, based on acoustic data only. It may be argued that this is impossible, because a computer lack life experience. Moreover, if the computer was able to make an accurate prediction, we also wanted to know what information it needed to make this prediction. We recruited 33 students (18 female; Mage = 25.4 yrs., SDage = 3.6) out of which 30 assessed how pleasant and eventful 102 unique soundscape excerpts (30 s) from Stockholm were. Based on the Bag of Frames approach, a Support Vector Regression learning algorithm was used to identify relationships between various acoustic features of the acoustics signals and perceived affective quality. We found that the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients provided strong predictions for both Pleasantness (R2 = 0.74) and Eventfulness (R2 = 0.83). This model performed better than the average individual in the experiment in terms of internal consistency of individual assessments. Taken together, the results show that a computer can predict the outcome of soundscape assessments, which is promising for future soundscape mapping. \u00a9 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA).

The value of the proposed analytical approach and some practical implications are demonstrated using operational data from a large urban police jurisdiction based in British Columbia, Canada.

This work introduces a radically novel approach for achieving this goal by exploiting the proliferation of remote sensing satellite imagery, allowing for the up-to-date generation of global-scale land cover maps. We propose the application of multilabel classification, a powerful framework in machine learning, for inferring the complex relationships between the acquired satellite images and the spectral profiles of different types of surface materials. Introducing a drastically different approach compared to unsupervised spectral unmixing, we employ contemporary ground-collected data from the European Environment Agency to generate the label set and multispectral images from the MODIS sensor to generate the spectral features, under a supervised classification framework. To validate the merits of our approach, we present results using several state-of-the-art multilabel learning classifiers and evaluate their predictive performance with respect to the number of annotated training examples, as well as their capability to exploit examples from neighboring regions or different time instances. We also demonstrate the application of our method on hyperspectral data from the Hyperion sensor for the urban land cover estimation of New York City. Experimental results suggest that the proposed framework can achieve excellent prediction accuracy, even from a limited number of diverse training examples, surpassing state-of-the-art spectral unmixing methods. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"CORINE; data processing; land cover; MODIS; pattern classification; remote sensing; satellite applications; time series; unmixing","Authors":"Karalas K., Tsagkatakis G., Zervakis M., Tsakalides P.","DOI":"10.1109\/TGRS.2016.2520203","x":9.69,"y":-4.86,"KeyPhrases":["urban land cover","multilabel classification","hyperspectral data","unsupervised spectral unmixing","powerful framework"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban land cover","score":0.5227319002},{"key-phrase":"hyperspectral data","score":0.5189871788},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.496820122},{"key-phrase":"multispectral image","score":0.4748792648},{"key-phrase":"multilabel classification","score":0.4710615277},{"key-phrase":"satellite imagery","score":0.4274761975},{"key-phrase":"supervised classification framework","score":0.3882838488},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised spectral unmixing","score":0.3871332705},{"key-phrase":"global-scale land","score":0.3734313548},{"key-phrase":"satellite image","score":0.3641114831},{"key-phrase":"art multilabel learning","score":0.3630734384},{"key-phrase":"spectral feature","score":0.3607445657},{"key-phrase":"multilabel","score":0.3482821584},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3365676701},{"key-phrase":"cover map","score":0.3197096288},{"key-phrase":"label set","score":0.2943153083},{"key-phrase":"spectral unmixing method","score":0.2848078609},{"key-phrase":"spectral profile","score":0.277272433},{"key-phrase":"human annotation","score":0.2680051923},{"key-phrase":"annotated training example","score":0.2510237098},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution description","score":0.2502344251},{"key-phrase":"excellent prediction accuracy","score":0.2384209335},{"key-phrase":"European Environment Agency","score":0.1844200194},{"key-phrase":"predictive performance","score":0.1682673842},{"key-phrase":"surface material","score":0.162355572},{"key-phrase":"Hyperion sensor","score":0.1593008339},{"key-phrase":"diverse training example","score":0.14978531},{"key-phrase":"unmixing","score":0.148321718},{"key-phrase":"field study","score":0.1430698931},{"key-phrase":"MODIS sensor","score":0.1369638443},{"key-phrase":"challenging task","score":0.1245385036},{"key-phrase":"powerful framework","score":0.0838667825},{"key-phrase":"complex relationship","score":0.0796269253},{"key-phrase":"novel approach","score":0.0732173473},{"key-phrase":"intensive process","score":0.064903684},{"key-phrase":"contemporary ground","score":0.060031224},{"key-phrase":"high cost","score":0.0581081696},{"key-phrase":"date generation","score":0.0553839542},{"key-phrase":"different type","score":0.0499223061},{"key-phrase":"several state","score":0.0453763269},{"key-phrase":"different time instance","score":0.0291915666},{"key-phrase":"New York City","score":0.0179227181},{"key-phrase":"Experimental result","score":0.0133007914},{"key-phrase":"different approach","score":0.0111154951},{"key-phrase":"limited number","score":0.0053967866}]},{"Cluster":30,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":532,"Cited by":null,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 10 papers.

A mobile operator can track people's movement in cities based on their cellular network location. This urban human mobility data contains rich knowledge about locations and can help in addressing many urban challenges such as traffic congestion or air pollution problems. In this article, we survey recent literature on urban human mobility from a data mining view: from the data collection and cleaning, to the mobility models and the applications. First, we summarize recent public urban human mobility data sets and how to clean and preprocess such data. Second, we describe recent urban human mobility models and predictors, e.g., the deep learning predictor, for predicting urban human mobility. Third, we describe how to evaluate the models and predictors.

While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

Early recognition and prediction of behavioral patterns are of great importance in many societal applications like urban planning, transportation optimization, and health-care. Understanding the relationships between human behaviors and location\u2019s context is an emerging interest for understanding human-environmental dynamics. Growing availability of Web 2.0, i.e. the increasing amount of websites with mainly user created content and social platforms opens up an opportunity to study such location\u2019s contexts. This paper investigates relationships existing between human behavior and location context, by analyzing log mobile phone data records. First an advanced approach to categorize areas in a city based on the presence and distribution of categories of human activity (e.g., eating, working, and shopping) found across the areas, is proposed. The proposed classification is then evaluated through its comparison with the patterns of temporal variation of mobile phone activity and applying machine learning techniques to predict a timeline type of communication activity in a given location based on the knowledge of the obtained category vs. land-use type of the locations areas. The proposed classification turns out to be more consistent with the temporal variation of human communication activity, being a better predictor for those compared to the official land use classification. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2016.","Author Keywords":"Big data; Cell phone data records; Clustering algorithms; Geospatial data; Human activity recognition; Human behavior; Knowledge management; Land-use; Supervised learning algorithms","Authors":"Dashdorj Z., Sobolevsky S.","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-662-53416-8_10","x":5.87,"y":-3.26,"KeyPhrases":["mobile phone activity","urban planning","machine learning technique","location context","human-environmental dynamic"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"mobile phone activity","score":0.5464339852},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone data","score":0.4429228008},{"key-phrase":"available mobile phone data","score":0.4039651453},{"key-phrase":"location context","score":0.402700007},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3727064133},{"key-phrase":"human communication activity","score":0.3702074289},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.3674803078},{"key-phrase":"human-environmental dynamic","score":0.3632503748},{"key-phrase":"location area","score":0.3509448171},{"key-phrase":"phone","score":0.3481008112},{"key-phrase":"human behavior","score":0.3281410336},{"key-phrase":"communication activity","score":0.2882094979},{"key-phrase":"human activity","score":0.260484159},{"key-phrase":"social platform","score":0.2593008578},{"key-phrase":"many societal application","score":0.256854713},{"key-phrase":"timeline type","score":0.2407655567},{"key-phrase":"such location","score":0.2130897939},{"key-phrase":"official land use","score":0.2107464075},{"key-phrase":"behavioral pattern","score":0.2005062997},{"key-phrase":"transportation optimization","score":0.1917672455},{"key-phrase":"human","score":0.1829235405},{"key-phrase":"use type","score":0.1556865722},{"key-phrase":"temporal variation","score":0.1539316475},{"key-phrase":"advanced approach","score":0.1374857277},{"key-phrase":"great importance","score":0.0683370978},{"key-phrase":"enormous amount","score":0.0367408395},{"key-phrase":"unprecedented direct measurement","score":-0.0310681462}]},{"Cluster":1,"Score":0.9110942155,"DocId":543,"Cited by":null,"Year":2016,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML PKDD 2016","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 39 papers.

The idea behind the solution is to use collected data about city residents' transportation needs (residents' preferences) and to build an optimal route network minimizing total cost of ownership. As transportation preferences of people are represented as a large set of geoobjects, machine learning algorithms were modified to take geodata specifics into account. Strategway includes the analytics core for data gathering, clustering and route design based on machine learning techniques.

It is coupled with a machine learning component that iteratively learns from the planners classifications to train a classifier.

Concerning high resolution remote image images, encoding the spatial features in an efficient and robust fashion is the key to generating discriminatory models to classify them. Even though many visual descriptors have been proposed or successfully used to encode spatial features of remote sensing images, some applications, using this sort of images, demand more specific description techniques. Deep Learning, an emergent machine learning approach based on neural networks, is capable of learning specific features and classifiers at the same time and adjust at each step, in real time, to better fit the need of each problem. For several task, such image classification, it has achieved very good results, mainly boosted by the feature learning performed which allows the method to extract specific and adaptable visual features depending on the data. In this paper, we propose a novel network capable of learning specific spatial features from remote sensing images, with any pre-processing step or descriptor evaluation, and classify them. Specifically, automatic feature learning task aims at discovering hierarchical structures from the raw data, leading to a more representative information. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for urban planning, crop and forest management and climate modelling. The propose convolutional neural network has six layers: three convolutional, two fully-connected and one classifier layer. So, the five first layers are responsible to extract visual features while the last one is responsible to classify the images. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using two datasets: (i) the popular aerial image dataset UCMerced Land-use and, (ii) a multispectral high-resolution scenes of the Brazilian Coffee Scenes. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overall accuracy. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Deep Learning; Feature Learning; High-resolution Images; Image Classification; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing","Authors":"Nogueira K., Miranda W.O., Santos J.A.D.","DOI":"10.1109\/SIBGRAPI.2015.39","x":9.57,"y":-5.5,"KeyPhrases":["image classification","forest management","popular aerial image dataset","Deep Learning","Brazilian Coffee Scenes"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"image classification","score":0.4876580238},{"key-phrase":"Deep Learning","score":0.4591991603},{"key-phrase":"popular aerial image dataset","score":0.4389317632},{"key-phrase":"such image classification","score":0.4385681748},{"key-phrase":"convolutional neural network","score":0.4384742677},{"key-phrase":"classifier layer","score":0.3974974751},{"key-phrase":"many visual descriptor","score":0.3915140331},{"key-phrase":"spatial feature","score":0.3689935803},{"key-phrase":"neural network","score":0.3397967517},{"key-phrase":"visual feature","score":0.3025465012},{"key-phrase":"specific spatial feature","score":0.3018274903},{"key-phrase":"descriptor evaluation","score":0.2911326885},{"key-phrase":"recognition algorithms","score":0.2848300934},{"key-phrase":"emergent machine learning","score":0.2684737444},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution scene","score":0.2632974386},{"key-phrase":"adaptable visual feature","score":0.2565606833},{"key-phrase":"remote image image","score":0.2397556305},{"key-phrase":"Brazilian Coffee Scenes","score":0.2308547348},{"key-phrase":"forest management","score":0.2303119004},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2263287008},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical structure","score":0.2163350284},{"key-phrase":"automatic feature","score":0.2096595168},{"key-phrase":"novel network","score":0.2066240609},{"key-phrase":"high resolution","score":0.2025953233},{"key-phrase":"UCMerced Land","score":0.1967343241},{"key-phrase":"first layer","score":0.1907145679},{"key-phrase":"raw data","score":0.1897243559},{"key-phrase":"specific feature","score":0.1866636574},{"key-phrase":"specific description technique","score":0.1738092601},{"key-phrase":"image","score":0.17101717},{"key-phrase":"climate modelling","score":0.1701720655},{"key-phrase":"representative information","score":0.1632530987},{"key-phrase":"huge opportunity","score":0.1598271728},{"key-phrase":"feature","score":0.1437490284},{"key-phrase":"several task","score":0.1361871064},{"key-phrase":"art algorithm","score":0.1008272171},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.0959778205},{"key-phrase":"task aim","score":0.0775613189},{"key-phrase":"pre-processing step","score":0.0745832324},{"key-phrase":"good result","score":0.0741179213},{"key-phrase":"last one","score":0.0670536682},{"key-phrase":"efficient and robust fashion","score":0.0606216453},{"key-phrase":"interesting challenge","score":0.0592483655},{"key-phrase":"real time","score":0.0572434217},{"key-phrase":"discriminatory model","score":0.0518795028},{"key-phrase":"proposed method","score":0.0495765656},{"key-phrase":"systematic evaluation","score":0.0389150903},{"key-phrase":"experiment show","score":0.0270704739},{"key-phrase":"same time","score":0.0157667585}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":550,"Cited by":23.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Cyber Cities: Social Media as a Tool for Understanding Cities","Abstract":"\u2018Big\u2019 urban data are increasingly becoming accessible for scientific research and policy use.

In this study, an urban land cover dataset received from the database of UCI (University of California at Irvine) machine learning was used as the urban land cover data. This dataset is the urban area located in Deerfield Beach, FL, USA. Separately, this dataset is a high definition atmospheric image consisting of 9 different urban land covers. The characteristics of a multi-scale spectral, magnitude and formal tectology were used to sort out and classify these different images. The dataset comprises a total of 147 features and land covers of 9 different areas involving trees, grass, soil, concrete, asphalt, buildings, cars, pools and shadows. A new data weighting method was recommended to classify these 9 different patterns automatically. This recommended data weighting method is based on the combination of the measures of central tendency composed of mean value, harmonic value, mode and median along with the k-means clustering method. In the data weighting method, the data sets belonging to each class within the dataset are first calculated by using k-means clustering method, after which the measures of central tendency belonging to each class are calculated, as well. The measure of central tendency belonging to each class is divided by the set central value belonging to the class in question, as the result of which the data weight coefficient of that class has already been calculated. This calculation process is performed separately for 9 different land covers, and afterwards, these data weighting coefficients found are multiplied by the dataset, and thus, the dataset has been weighted. In the second stage, on the other hand, 3 different classification algorithms containing k-NN (k-nearest neighbor), extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to classify 9 different urban land covers after the data weighting method. In determining the educational and test data sets, the 10-fold cross validation was used. When classification through raw data was performed along with k-NN (for k = 1), ELM and SVM classification algorithms, the overall classification accuracy obtained was 77.15%, 84.70% and 84.79%, respectively. When classification through data weighting method (the combination of k-means clustering and mode measure) along with k-NN (for k = 1), ELM and SVM classification algorithms was made, the overall classification accuracy obtained proved to be 98.58%, 98.62% and 98.77%, respectively. The obtained results suggest that the urban land cover in an atmospheric image via the recommended data weighting method was classified as 9 different areas with a high classification success rate. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Water resources in urban areas are gradually decreasing due to the rapid urbanization, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the precise extraction and automatic identification of water bodies are of great significance and urgently required for urban planning. It should be noted that although some studies have been reported regarding the water-area extraction, to our knowledge, few papers concern the identification of urban water types (e.g., rivers, lakes, canals, and ponds). In this paper, a novel two-level machine-learning framework is proposed for identifying the water types from urban high-resolution remote-sensing images. The framework consists of two interpretation levels: 1) water bodies are extracted at the pixel level, where the water\/shadow\/vegetation indexes are considered and 2) water types are further identified at the object level, where a set of geometrical and textural features are used.

This makes the monitoring and modeling of urban change\u2019s spatial patterns critical to urban planners, decision makers, and environment protection activists. Although a wide range of methods exists for modeling and simulating urban growth, machine learning (ML) techniques have received less attention despite their potential for producing highly accurate predictions of future urban extents. The aim of this study is to investigate two ML techniques, namely radial basis function network (RBFN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, for modeling urban change. By predicting urban change for 2010, the models\u2019 performance is evaluated by comparing results with a reference map and by using a set of pertinent statistical measures, such as average spatial distance deviation and figure of merit. The application of these techniques employs the case study area of Mumbai, India. The results show that both models, which were tested using the same explanatory variables, produced promising results in terms of predicting the size and extent of future urban areas. Although a close match between RBFN and MLP is observed, RBFN demonstrates higher spatial accuracy of prediction. Accordingly, RBFN was utilized to simulate urban change for 2020 and 2030. Overall, the study provides evidence that RBFN is a robust and efficient ML technique and can therefore be recommended for land use change modeling. \u00a9 2015, \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"GIS; multi-layer perceptron network; radial basis function network; spatial accuracy assessment; urban change","Authors":"Shafizadeh-Moghadam H., Hagenauer J., Farajzadeh M., Helbich M.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2014.993989","x":8.87,"y":-3.15,"KeyPhrases":["future urban extent","multi-layer perceptron","spatial pattern","radial basis function","land use change"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"future urban extent","score":0.5739274025},{"key-phrase":"future urban area","score":0.5611843467},{"key-phrase":"urban growth","score":0.525390029},{"key-phrase":"land use change","score":0.4463969469},{"key-phrase":"urban change","score":0.4371740222},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.4071502388},{"key-phrase":"multi-layer perceptron","score":0.3724919856},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3351936638},{"key-phrase":"spatial pattern","score":0.3219105005},{"key-phrase":"radial basis function","score":0.3078388572},{"key-phrase":"spatial accuracy","score":0.2918101549},{"key-phrase":"accurate prediction","score":0.2795092463},{"key-phrase":"ML technique","score":0.274782002},{"key-phrase":"robust and efficient ML technique","score":0.2549025416},{"key-phrase":"average spatial distance deviation","score":0.2156890631},{"key-phrase":"reference map","score":0.1975763291},{"key-phrase":"case study area","score":0.1966110766},{"key-phrase":"RBFN","score":0.1743863523},{"key-phrase":"pertinent statistical measure","score":0.1688124835},{"key-phrase":"environment protection activist","score":0.1295786798},{"key-phrase":"decision maker","score":0.1176607013},{"key-phrase":"same explanatory variable","score":0.108425878},{"key-phrase":"promising result","score":0.0809782296},{"key-phrase":"change","score":0.0675436109},{"key-phrase":"wide range","score":0.0473241694},{"key-phrase":"close match","score":0.0245224759},{"key-phrase":"result show","score":0.0167749785}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":554,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Systematic data mining into land consumption in Germany","Abstract":"This paper presents a systematic approach for discovering comprehensible, valid, potentially innovative and useful structures in multivariate municipality data.

It can be used to aid in urban planning, hazard assessments and disaster risk management among others. Light Detection and Ranging or LiDAR, is one of the most powerful remote sensing technologies nowadays. Many studies have used the fusion of LiDAR data and multispectral images in detecting buildings. This study seeks to maximize the power of LiDAR imagery to be able to classify buildings without the aid of multispectral imagery. This work follows the Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach. Instead of the traditional pixel-based classification methods, pixels are segmented into logical groups called objects. From these objects, features for building extraction are calculated. These features are: the number of returns, difference of returns, and the mean and standard deviation of positive surface openness. These objects are then classified using different machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. A comparative assessment was done on the performance of these different machine learning classifiers. The classifiers performed similarly with the Random Forest Classifier slightly outperforming the others.","Author Keywords":"Feature extraction; Object based image analysis","Authors":"Escamos I.M.H., Roberto A.R.C., Abucay E.R., Inciong G.K.L., Queliste M.D., Hermocilla J.A.C.","DOI":null,"x":8.98,"y":-4.94,"KeyPhrases":["LiDAR imagery","Random Forest Classifier","Building extraction","Image Analysis","positive surface openness"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"LiDAR imagery","score":0.5195846558},{"key-phrase":"Building extraction","score":0.490734458},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest Classifier","score":0.4874691665},{"key-phrase":"LiDAR data","score":0.4826105237},{"key-phrase":"Random Forests","score":0.4720355868},{"key-phrase":"Decision Trees","score":0.4193573594},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machines","score":0.4124190211},{"key-phrase":"classifier","score":0.4032308459},{"key-phrase":"Image Analysis","score":0.3986867666},{"key-phrase":"classification method","score":0.3900295794},{"key-phrase":"multispectral imagery","score":0.3864889145},{"key-phrase":"Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier","score":0.3861795068},{"key-phrase":"Nearest Neighbors","score":0.3588743508},{"key-phrase":"multispectral image","score":0.3583857417},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3039965332},{"key-phrase":"Light Detection","score":0.2875633538},{"key-phrase":"hazard assessment","score":0.1997039914},{"key-phrase":"disaster risk management","score":0.1793997288},{"key-phrase":"comparative assessment","score":0.1210236549},{"key-phrase":"positive surface openness","score":0.1120835692},{"key-phrase":"traditional pixel","score":0.1057001427},{"key-phrase":"important problem","score":0.0986442268},{"key-phrase":"different machine","score":0.070497036},{"key-phrase":"Many study","score":0.068723619},{"key-phrase":"logical group","score":0.0580404364},{"key-phrase":"standard deviation","score":0.0335610285},{"key-phrase":"return","score":0.029928688}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":558,"Cited by":7.0,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Automatic sound recognition of urban environment events","Abstract":"The audio analysis of speaker\u2019s surroundings has been a first step for several processing systems that enable speaker\u2019s mobility though his daily life.

Deep learning is springing up in the field of machine learning recently. By mimicking the hierarchical structure of the human brain, deep learning can gradually extract features from lower level to higher level. The Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model is a widely investigated and deployed deep learning architecture. It combines the advantages of unsupervised and supervised learning and can archive good classification performance. This study proposes a classification approach based on the DBN model for detailed urban mapping using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. Through the DBN model, effective contextual mapping features can be automatically extracted from the PolSAR data to improve the classification performance. Two-date high-resolution RADARSAT-2 PolSAR data over the Great Toronto Area were used for evaluation. Comparisons with the support vector machine (SVM), conventional neural networks (NN), and stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) were conducted to assess the potential of the DBN-based classification approach. Experimental results show that the DBN-based method outperforms three other approaches and produces homogenous mapping results with preserved shape details. \u00a9 2015 Qi Lv et al.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Lv Q., Dou Y., Niu X., Xu J., Xu J., Xia F.","DOI":"10.1155\/2015\/538063","x":9.55,"y":-5.39,"KeyPhrases":["Deep Belief Networks","land cover","PolSAR data","effective contextual mapping feature","detailed urban mapping"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Deep Belief Networks","score":0.5445356369},{"key-phrase":"deep learning architecture","score":0.4852396846},{"key-phrase":"Deep learning","score":0.449732244},{"key-phrase":"detailed urban mapping","score":0.4466865063},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.4200335145},{"key-phrase":"conventional neural network","score":0.3626932502},{"key-phrase":"effective contextual mapping feature","score":0.3294426501},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3290719986},{"key-phrase":"Land use","score":0.3108396828},{"key-phrase":"unsupervised and supervised learning","score":0.3067724109},{"key-phrase":"modern urban planning","score":0.2855864763},{"key-phrase":"polarimetric synthetic aperture radar","score":0.2846460342},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.2801674008},{"key-phrase":"PolSAR data","score":0.2780177593},{"key-phrase":"high-resolution RADARSAT","score":0.2736361623},{"key-phrase":"good classification performance","score":0.2714871764},{"key-phrase":"DBN model","score":0.261002779},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.2529310882},{"key-phrase":"classification approach","score":0.2509860992},{"key-phrase":"classification performance","score":0.2504858673},{"key-phrase":"2 PolSAR data","score":0.2321734577},{"key-phrase":"DBN","score":0.2151153833},{"key-phrase":"homogenous mapping","score":0.2087023258},{"key-phrase":"hierarchical structure","score":0.2052789629},{"key-phrase":"human brain","score":0.1810399294},{"key-phrase":"polsar","score":0.1658008099},{"key-phrase":"shape detail","score":0.1651418656},{"key-phrase":"Great Toronto Area","score":0.1143803298},{"key-phrase":"stochastic Expectation","score":0.0889587775},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0852973759},{"key-phrase":"can archive","score":0.0673144311},{"key-phrase":"other approach","score":0.0214165188},{"key-phrase":"Experimental result","score":0.0057001803},{"key-phrase":"core application","score":-0.0055097397}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":560,"Cited by":null,"Year":2015,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"2nd International Workshop on Mining Urban Data (Preface)","Abstract":"This paper presents an overview of the second International Workshop on Mining Urban Data (MUD2).

Hence the ability to proactively detect and even predict potential threats related to terrorist attacks is crucial for supporting government agencies in order to timely react (pro-act) to potentially alarming terrorist attacks. The work described in this paper is part of an overall larger effort in developing a framework for early identification and prediction of terrorist actions (the PROACTIVE project-http:\/\/www.fp7-proactive.eu\/). The paper focuses on a near real-time reasoning layer designed around a number of reasoning capabilities for transforming raw and symbolic events into meaningful alerts. The reasoning layer was designed to process information sources at different abstraction levels (e.g. sensor information, police patrol inputs, external semantic crafted data sources) and simulates various expert user roles indicated as crucial in the intelligence analyst work flow (i.e. operational, tactical and strategic user roles). Additionally a special focus was given to support functional requirements of the overall terrorist attack prediction system, as producing near real-time detection of threat events by relying on reliable models regarding terrorist actions and predicting sensitive threat events.

For the above applications, LIDAR data need to be classified into binary classes (i.e., terrain and nonterrain) or multiple classes (e.g., ground, vegetation, and buildings). The proposed framework is designed to enhance the generalization performance of binary classification approach by minimizing type II errors. The authors developed and tested the framework on different LIDAR data sets representing geographic sites in Germany and the United States. The results showed that the proposed ensemble framework performed better compared to the existing methods. In addition, the AdaBoost method outperformed the Bagging method on all the terrain types.

An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3% of instances correctly classified). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Acoustical assessment; Classification model; Sequential Minimal Optimization; Soundscape classifier; Soundscape evaluation; Support Vector Machines","Authors":"Torija A.J., Ruiz D.P., Ramos-Ridao T.F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2013.07.108","x":4.6199998856,"y":2.4700000286,"KeyPhrases":["soundscape classification","SVM model","urban-planning authority","comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation","Sequential Minimal Optimization"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"soundscape classification","score":0.7741036415},{"key-phrase":"comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation","score":0.7194054127},{"key-phrase":"urban soundscapes","score":0.6828522682},{"key-phrase":"appropriate soundscape management","score":0.6163529754},{"key-phrase":"soundscape","score":0.5813672543},{"key-phrase":"subjective and acoustical categorization","score":0.5571120381},{"key-phrase":"acoustical and perceptual criterion","score":0.4625426829},{"key-phrase":"automatic classification","score":0.4607536793},{"key-phrase":"Support Vector Machines","score":0.4594160318},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4119653106},{"key-phrase":"sound standpoint","score":0.3980075419},{"key-phrase":"classification model","score":0.3949377835},{"key-phrase":"model classification","score":0.3761685491},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3715960383},{"key-phrase":"SVM model","score":0.368714571},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.3606106639},{"key-phrase":"urban-planning authority","score":0.2526604533},{"key-phrase":"Sequential Minimal Optimization","score":0.2365035117},{"key-phrase":"SMO algorithm","score":0.2110824883},{"key-phrase":"specific task","score":0.1346643865},{"key-phrase":"great complexity","score":0.1222856045},{"key-phrase":"outstanding performance","score":0.1089115813},{"key-phrase":"SMO","score":0.0913076848},{"key-phrase":"SMO model","score":0.0850449726},{"key-phrase":"people's expectation","score":0.0715858564},{"key-phrase":"first step","score":0.0386210121},{"key-phrase":"essential step","score":0.0080878111}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":565,"Cited by":48.0,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"From land cover-graphs to urban structure types","Abstract":"Urban structure types (UST) are an initial interest and basic instrument for monitoring, controlling and modeling tasks of urban planners and decision makers during ongoing urbanization processes.

The analysis provides a basis for better control of anthropogenic impacts and geoconservation activities in this coastal area of Rio de Janeiro. \u00a9 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","Author Keywords":"AdaBoost; coastal environments; land use and land cover change; Reg\u0129o dos Lagos","Authors":"Avelar S., Tokarczyk P.","DOI":"10.1117\/1.JRS.8.083631","x":9.76,"y":-4.06,"KeyPhrases":["coastal area development","supervised classification","spatiotemporal change","rio","satellite image"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"coastal area development","score":0.542366147},{"key-phrase":"Land use change","score":0.5046563148},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.4679861069},{"key-phrase":"Land use","score":0.4224076867},{"key-phrase":"supervised classification","score":0.421851337},{"key-phrase":"Coastal area","score":0.3743585944},{"key-phrase":"dense vegetation","score":0.3638216555},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.356855005},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.3439103365},{"key-phrase":"spatiotemporal change","score":0.3242850304},{"key-phrase":"satellite image","score":0.2947534919},{"key-phrase":"rio","score":0.2833791375},{"key-phrase":"Historical aerial photographs","score":0.2777791619},{"key-phrase":"geoconservation activity","score":0.2694636881},{"key-phrase":"coastal","score":0.2639570534},{"key-phrase":"anthropogenic impact","score":0.2514466941},{"key-phrase":"Rio de Janeiro","score":0.2164598405},{"key-phrase":"environmental protection","score":0.2073242068},{"key-phrase":"accuracy assessment","score":0.1906050444},{"key-phrase":"recreational and economic opportunity","score":0.1791127324},{"key-phrase":"bare soil","score":0.1683163941},{"key-phrase":"intensive resource management","score":0.1615192592},{"key-phrase":"effective mean","score":0.088721931}]},{"Cluster":16,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":570,"Cited by":26.0,"Year":2014,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Driving forces analysis of urban expansion based on boosted regression trees and Logistic regression","Abstract":"The rapid relentless urban area expansion has led to a series of problems in China. Many researches focused on this issue in recent years. Driving forces are the core topic in urban expansion,as well as the basic component of modeling and predicting. It is very useful and meaningful to analyze the driving force of urban expansion, which may provide us with a scientific basis to rationally utilize land resources, determining the law of urban development, researching the evolution process, predicting the urban expansion trends, and also providing guidance for the development of rational control policies. The Shenyang city was chosen as study area. Eight categories of land use types were extracted from remote sensing images (1997 and 2010) with ArcGIS software. Ten driving forces were chosen, including three natural factors, three distance factors, four social and economic factors. which were calculated based on the land use maps, DEM, topographic maps, zoning maps and the statistical yearbooks. The dependent variable was the change of built-up area of Shenyang from 1997 to 2010. Boosted regression trees (BRT) is an ensemble method and is a combination of techniques between statistical and machine learning traditions that has shown to be effective to identify relationships between results and influencing factors. Logistic regression is a method to discover the empirical relationships between a binary dependent and several independent categorical and continuous variables. Boosted Regression Trees and Logistic regression were used to analyze the main driving force of urban expansion synthetically. The result illustrated the relative influence of driving factors was followed by distance from urban area of 1997, distance from river, DEM, distance from highway and railway, land use types, development plan, GDP, population density, aspect, and slope based on BRT analysis. According to Logistic regression analysis, the relative influence of important factors was followed by development zone, distance from urban land of 1997, DEM, distance from highway and railway, population density, distance from river, rural residential areas and slope. The most important driving forces affecting the expansion of Shenyang are distance from urban area of 1997, DEM, distance from highway and railway. Meanwhile, they were all located in the top four of the main factors. The results revealed that the distance factors were the most important factors, and the total contribution rate of relative influence was up to 61.4%. It is demonstrated distance factors are the main driving forces of urban expansion. Natural factorswere less important, but the relative influence of DEM was important, and the contribution rate was 12.5%. Development zones and rural settlements are the only two factors have much influence in the socio-economic factors. On the whole, location factors, which refer to the distance from urban land in this study, were the leading factors of urban expansion. Natural factors, such as DEM, rivers and so on, are the basis of urban development, determining the overall urban spatial form. The construction of infrastructures, such as roads and railways, are the frame of the city. The social and economic factors decided the speed of urban expansion. Urban planning and development zone construction provided the direction of urban expansion.","Author Keywords":"Boosted regression trees; Driving forces; Logistic regression; Shenyang city; Urban expansion","Authors":"Li C.L., Liu M., Hu Y.M., Xu Y.Y., Sun F.Y.","DOI":"10.5846\/stxb201212121790","x":8.84,"y":-3.42,"KeyPhrases":["urban expansion trend","Logistic regression","topographic map","Shenyang city","distance factor"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban expansion trend","score":0.5877094269},{"key-phrase":"relentless urban area expansion","score":0.5508468151},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion","score":0.4937951267},{"key-phrase":"urban development","score":0.4915879667},{"key-phrase":"Urban planning","score":0.4760644436},{"key-phrase":"urban spatial form","score":0.4365055561},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.4114209414},{"key-phrase":"urban land","score":0.409034133},{"key-phrase":"regression tree","score":0.4023368657},{"key-phrase":"Regression Trees","score":0.3988671601},{"key-phrase":"land use map","score":0.396337539},{"key-phrase":"development zone construction","score":0.3754164279},{"key-phrase":"Logistic regression analysis","score":0.3500238061},{"key-phrase":"land use type","score":0.3438619375},{"key-phrase":"zoning map","score":0.3404046297},{"key-phrase":"Logistic regression","score":0.32657516},{"key-phrase":"population density","score":0.3134063482},{"key-phrase":"Shenyang city","score":0.2800865769},{"key-phrase":"topographic map","score":0.2752946019},{"key-phrase":"development zone","score":0.2594606578},{"key-phrase":"rural residential area","score":0.2462024987},{"key-phrase":"social and economic factor","score":0.2364236414},{"key-phrase":"ArcGIS software","score":0.2266770154},{"key-phrase":"empirical relationship","score":0.2233127058},{"key-phrase":"dependent variable","score":0.2104937285},{"key-phrase":"economic factor","score":0.2079373002},{"key-phrase":"land resource","score":0.2060362995},{"key-phrase":"ensemble method","score":0.2058012635},{"key-phrase":"development plan","score":0.2020906061},{"key-phrase":"categorical and continuous variable","score":0.2000641227},{"key-phrase":"location factor","score":0.1998300552},{"key-phrase":"machine learning tradition","score":0.195709765},{"key-phrase":"BRT analysis","score":0.1873340607},{"key-phrase":"distance factor","score":0.1851870269},{"key-phrase":"rural settlement","score":0.18224594},{"key-phrase":"relative influence","score":0.1701214612},{"key-phrase":"Natural factorswere","score":0.1631522477},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1350198388},{"key-phrase":"important factor","score":0.1303073466},{"key-phrase":"main factor","score":0.1270667017},{"key-phrase":"Many research","score":0.1239190698},{"key-phrase":"evolution process","score":0.1227878109},{"key-phrase":"leading factor","score":0.120551005},{"key-phrase":"scientific basis","score":0.1150362119},{"key-phrase":"distance","score":0.076873228},{"key-phrase":"natural factor","score":0.0732415095},{"key-phrase":"much influence","score":0.059494637},{"key-phrase":"core topic","score":0.0568928383},{"key-phrase":"statistical yearbook","score":0.0480033308},{"key-phrase":"basic component","score":0.0460088365},{"key-phrase":"total contribution rate","score":0.0428638384},{"key-phrase":"recent year","score":0.0397571325},{"key-phrase":"rational control policy","score":0.0382368751},{"key-phrase":"contribution rate","score":0.0378847793},{"key-phrase":"DEM","score":-0.0084734457}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":571,"Cited by":25.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Temporal decomposition and semantic enrichment of mobility flows","Abstract":"Mobility data has increasingly grown in volume over the past decade as localisation technologies for capturing mobility flows have become ubiquitous.

Although the urban growth in Athens can be mostly attributed to the expansion of the residential areas, the total coverage by impervious surfaces in the city has been significantly increased during the last decade due to construction and new development projects that took place during the preparation period of the 2004 Olympic Games. In this study, a 20-year Landsat imagery archive (1988-2007) was used to map the dynamics of urban growth in greater Athens area, based on the urbanization rates. The characterization and quantification of urban land-cover changes was performed by applying urban feature extraction techniques based on machine learning classifiers. Such classifiers use inductive learning algorithms to generate production rules from training data. For results validation, remote sensing data of higher spatial resolution than Landsat were used, i.e. Ikonosand ASTER (Advanced Specaborn Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images of the greater Athens agglomeration acquired between 2001 and 2007. The validation procedure involved a set of randomly selected points and overall accuracy of 94.8, 93.3 and 95.9 % for the years 2007, 2004 and 2001, respectively, was observed. Analysis of the results revealed continuing growth of urban features in the study area, particularly in the Messogia plain, where the new international airport of El. Venizelos is located, as well as in the western parts of greater Athens, across the Thriassion industrial area. Growth rate of urban areas was found to be variable in time, obtaining its maximum between 2000 and 2004, as expected. The overall increase of the urban areas during the 20-year period was estimated to be about 30%.","Author Keywords":"Earth observation; Urban growth monitoring; Urban planning.","Authors":"Chrysoulakis N., Mitraka Z., Stathopoulou M., Cartalis C.","DOI":null,"x":9.43,"y":-3.78,"KeyPhrases":["urban feature extraction","Growth rate","year Landsat imagery","Athens agglomeration","impervious surface"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban feature extraction","score":0.5489638448},{"key-phrase":"urban growth","score":0.5382922888},{"key-phrase":"urban land","score":0.5203151703},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.5028096437},{"key-phrase":"urbanization rate","score":0.4673930705},{"key-phrase":"Athens agglomeration","score":0.4253661633},{"key-phrase":"urban feature","score":0.412991941},{"key-phrase":"year Landsat imagery","score":0.3937391341},{"key-phrase":"machine learning classifier","score":0.3694520295},{"key-phrase":"industrial area","score":0.3682903051},{"key-phrase":"residential area","score":0.3527432084},{"key-phrase":"inductive learning algorithms","score":0.3201609254},{"key-phrase":"athens","score":0.3119155765},{"key-phrase":"world's capital city","score":0.2959830761},{"key-phrase":"Such classifier use","score":0.2902639508},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.2865601182},{"key-phrase":"Athens area","score":0.2623550296},{"key-phrase":"Growth rate","score":0.2493161261},{"key-phrase":"new international airport","score":0.2390871942},{"key-phrase":"spatial resolution","score":0.2198380381},{"key-phrase":"new development project","score":0.2186121941},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.2178105712},{"key-phrase":"impervious surface","score":0.183288455},{"key-phrase":"growth","score":0.1826533675},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1662347764},{"key-phrase":"overall increase","score":0.1543541551},{"key-phrase":"production rule","score":0.1517288387},{"key-phrase":"validation procedure","score":0.1285927147},{"key-phrase":"continuous increase","score":0.1280522794},{"key-phrase":"result validation","score":0.1236469522},{"key-phrase":"Ikonosand ASTER","score":0.1179608926},{"key-phrase":"total coverage","score":0.1131487936},{"key-phrase":"Olympic Games","score":0.109377645},{"key-phrase":"Reflection Radiometer","score":0.0999722183},{"key-phrase":"year period","score":0.0807407722},{"key-phrase":"cover change","score":0.0785931274},{"key-phrase":"western part","score":0.0630915016},{"key-phrase":"preparation period","score":0.0463866591},{"key-phrase":"last decade","score":0.0407955498},{"key-phrase":"Advanced Specaborn Thermal","score":0.0285768434}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":573,"Cited by":92.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Exploiting foursquare and cellular data to infer user activity in urban environments","Abstract":"Inferring the type of activities in neighborhoods of urban centers may be helpful in a number of contexts including urban planning, content delivery and activity recommendations for mobile web users or may even yield to a deeper understanding of the geographical evolution of social life in the city. During the past few years, the analysis of mobile phone usage patterns, or of social media with longitudinal attributes, have aided the automatic characterization of the dynamics of the urban environment. In this work, we combine a dataset sourced from a telecommunication provider in Spain with a database of millions of geo-tagged venues from Foursquare and we formulate the problem of urban activity inference in a supervised learning framework. In particular, we exploit user communication patterns observed at the base station level in order to predict the activity of Foursquare users who checkin-in at nearby venues. First, we mine a set of machine learning features that allow us to encode the input telecommunication signal of a tower. Subsequently, we evaluate a diverse set of supervised learning algorithms using labels extracted from Foursquare place categories and we consider two application scenarios. Initially, we assess how hard it is to predict specific urban activity of an area, showing that Nightlife and Entertainment spots are those easier to infer, whereas College and Shopping areas are those featuring the lowest accuracy rates. Then, considering a candidate set of activity types in a geographic area, we aim to elect the most prominent one. We demonstrate how the difficulty of the problem increases with the number of classes incorporated in the prediction task, yet the classifiers achieve a considerably better performance compared to a random guess even when the set of candidate classes increases. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"cellular data; location-based services; urban mining","Authors":"Noulas A., Mascolo C., Frias-Martinez E.","DOI":"10.1109\/MDM.2013.27","x":5.88,"y":-3.24,"KeyPhrases":["urban activity inference","Foursquare user","activity type","supervised learning framework","nearby venue"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"urban activity inference","score":0.6934478283},{"key-phrase":"specific urban activity","score":0.5008174181},{"key-phrase":"foursquare","score":0.4877761602},{"key-phrase":"Foursquare place category","score":0.4785507321},{"key-phrase":"activity recommendation","score":0.4339914322},{"key-phrase":"Foursquare user","score":0.4322383106},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4138205051},{"key-phrase":"mobile phone usage","score":0.3703921437},{"key-phrase":"supervised learning algorithms","score":0.3526080251},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.3413672447},{"key-phrase":"activity type","score":0.3388732076},{"key-phrase":"urban center","score":0.3380707204},{"key-phrase":"supervised learning framework","score":0.3249537051},{"key-phrase":"prediction task","score":0.3172750175},{"key-phrase":"machine learning feature","score":0.3169480562},{"key-phrase":"social medium","score":0.2981410027},{"key-phrase":"activity","score":0.2857155204},{"key-phrase":"automatic characterization","score":0.2712512314},{"key-phrase":"social life","score":0.2708632648},{"key-phrase":"random guess","score":0.2629557252},{"key-phrase":"nearby venue","score":0.2538993955},{"key-phrase":"mobile web user","score":0.2527475357},{"key-phrase":"geographic area","score":0.2414265871},{"key-phrase":"Shopping area","score":0.2391268313},{"key-phrase":"Entertainment spot","score":0.2390561253},{"key-phrase":"user communication pattern","score":0.2056261897},{"key-phrase":"geographical evolution","score":0.2020336539},{"key-phrase":"prominent one","score":0.2005074918},{"key-phrase":"application scenario","score":0.1980472207},{"key-phrase":"telecommunication provider","score":0.1910016835},{"key-phrase":"candidate set","score":0.1821626723},{"key-phrase":"content delivery","score":0.1754789203},{"key-phrase":"longitudinal attribute","score":0.1701793969},{"key-phrase":"candidate class increases","score":0.1514497399},{"key-phrase":"diverse set","score":0.1442239285},{"key-phrase":"input telecommunication signal","score":0.1258520484},{"key-phrase":"accuracy rate","score":0.1164622009},{"key-phrase":"base station level","score":0.1079185307},{"key-phrase":"past few year","score":0.0430777371}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":574,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2013,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Automated urban location annotation on mobile records","Abstract":"Location information is becoming much more important than ever before, especially in mobile services.

Currently, urban planners are hindered by a lack of information available in a format suitable for the large-scale analysis of sidewalk design. To demonstrate the impact that information technology could have in this area, we leverage techniques from machine learning and computer vision to gather information about the presence and quality of sidewalks in map images. In particular, we identify sidewalk segments in street view images using a random forest classifier, utilizing a set of local and global features that include geometric context, presence of lanes, pixel color, and location. Our results illustrate that this approach is effective in classifying sidewalk segments in a large set of street view images. This algorithm can be easily extended to other datasets, and can be automated to gather complete, fine-grained details about sidewalks for arbitrarily large urban environments. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Smith V., Malik J., Culler D.","DOI":"10.1109\/IGCC.2013.6604476","x":5.75,"y":6.5700001717,"KeyPhrases":["Mapping sidewalk","random forest classifier","sustainable city","pixel color","computer vision"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Mapping sidewalk","score":0.5895403624},{"key-phrase":"sidewalk design","score":0.538423121},{"key-phrase":"street view image","score":0.4806783199},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4504345655},{"key-phrase":"large urban environment","score":0.4345449209},{"key-phrase":"sidewalk","score":0.4340539873},{"key-phrase":"sidewalk segment","score":0.4199233651},{"key-phrase":"random forest classifier","score":0.4174489379},{"key-phrase":"computer vision","score":0.370583564},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.3654248714},{"key-phrase":"urban planner","score":0.3501026332},{"key-phrase":"sustainable city","score":0.2951898873},{"key-phrase":"map image","score":0.292658329},{"key-phrase":"fine-grained detail","score":0.2742670774},{"key-phrase":"local and global feature","score":0.1714589745},{"key-phrase":"large-scale analysis","score":0.1671451032},{"key-phrase":"other datasets","score":0.1658441275},{"key-phrase":"geometric context","score":0.1471500099},{"key-phrase":"information technology","score":0.1437778026},{"key-phrase":"pixel color","score":0.1368751973},{"key-phrase":"large set","score":0.0667951554},{"key-phrase":"gather","score":0.0129035208}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":576,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Accuracy comparison of land cover mapping using the object-oriented image classification with machine learning algorithms","Abstract":"Land cover mapping provides basic information for advanced science such as ecological management, biodiversity conservation, forest planning and so on. In remote sensing research, the process of creating an accurate land cover map is an important subject. Recently, there has been growing research interest in the object-oriented image classification techniques. The object-oriented image classification consists of multidimensional features including object features and thus requires multi-dimensional image classification approaches. For example, a linear model such as the maximum likelihood method of pixel-based classification cannot characterize the patterns or relations of multi-dimensional data. In multi-dimensional image classification, data mining and ensemble learning have been shown to increase accuracy and flexibility. This study examined the use of the object-oriented image classification by the multiple machine learning algorithms for land cover mapping. We applied four classifiers: Classification and regression tree (CART), Decision tree with Boosting, Decision tree with Bagging, and Random Forest. The study area was Sado Island in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Pan-sharpened SPOT\/HRG imagery (June 2007) was used and classified into the following eight classes: broad-leaved deciduous forest, Japanese cedar, Japanese red pine, bamboo forest, paddy field, urban area, road, and bare land. We prepared four data sets with the object based features including textural information. The number of features is increased from data set I through IV. As the result, CART was unsuitable for multi-dimensional classification. Random Forest and Decision tree with Boosting showed high classification accuracies. Furthermore, in the data set with the limited features, Decision tree with Boosting was the accurate classifier. Finally, we propose two machine learning algorithms to every datasets. Random Forest is effective in the case of the multi-dimensional image classification such as data set II, III, and IV. Decision tree with Boosting is effective in the case of the image classification with the limited features such as data set I.","Author Keywords":"Bagging; Boosting; Classification and regression tree; Ensemble classifier; Random Forest","Authors":"Mochizuki S., Murakami T.","DOI":null,"x":9.79,"y":-4.4,"KeyPhrases":["Land cover mapping","multi-dimensional image classification","regression tree","Japanese cedar","machine learning algorithm"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"Land cover mapping","score":0.5985631943},{"key-phrase":"Random Forest","score":0.5436931849},{"key-phrase":"multi-dimensional image classification","score":0.5083307028},{"key-phrase":"accurate land cover","score":0.4985131025},{"key-phrase":"image classification","score":0.4951198399},{"key-phrase":"image classification technique","score":0.4932268858},{"key-phrase":"multi-dimensional classification","score":0.4929626286},{"key-phrase":"Decision tree","score":0.4554845393},{"key-phrase":"forest planning","score":0.4516071379},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.4295969605},{"key-phrase":"regression tree","score":0.3795795739},{"key-phrase":"accurate classifier","score":0.3668035865},{"key-phrase":"classification","score":0.3649368286},{"key-phrase":"ensemble learning","score":0.3564606309},{"key-phrase":"high classification accuracy","score":0.3535712361},{"key-phrase":"broad-leaved deciduous forest","score":0.3404536545},{"key-phrase":"data mining","score":0.325340569},{"key-phrase":"bamboo forest","score":0.322250247},{"key-phrase":"multi-dimensional data","score":0.3090424538},{"key-phrase":"multidimensional feature","score":0.2932650149},{"key-phrase":"textural information","score":0.2819742858},{"key-phrase":"tree","score":0.2754870057},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.2431173176},{"key-phrase":"Japanese red pine","score":0.2346533984},{"key-phrase":"ecological management","score":0.2299936563},{"key-phrase":"object feature","score":0.2109218687},{"key-phrase":"bare land","score":0.2070999146},{"key-phrase":"Japanese cedar","score":0.2027987242},{"key-phrase":"biodiversity conservation","score":0.1644704342},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1403495669},{"key-phrase":"Niigata Prefecture","score":0.1395065486},{"key-phrase":"basic information","score":0.1267396659},{"key-phrase":"advanced science","score":0.1163395941},{"key-phrase":"paddy field","score":0.1133200005},{"key-phrase":"important subject","score":0.1124308854},{"key-phrase":"HRG imagery","score":0.1097960323},{"key-phrase":"linear model","score":0.1052737311},{"key-phrase":"limited feature","score":0.082594797},{"key-phrase":"maximum likelihood method","score":0.0812063664},{"key-phrase":"multiple machine","score":0.0776490346},{"key-phrase":"Sado Island","score":0.0758701563},{"key-phrase":"research interest","score":0.0490057059}]},{"Cluster":18,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":577,"Cited by":5.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Classification of urban scenes from georeferenced images in urban street-view context","Abstract":"This paper addresses the challenging problem of scene classification in street-view georeferenced images of urban environments.

The approach is based on the BOSSA representation, which enriches the Bag of Words (BoW) model, in conjunction with the Spatial Pyramid Matching scheme and kernel-based machine learning techniques. The proposed method handles problems that arise in large scale urban environments due to acquisition conditions (static and dynamic objects\/pedestrians) combined with the continuous acquisition of data along the vehicles direction, the varying light conditions and strong occlusions (due to the presence of trees, traffic signs, cars, etc.) giving rise to high intra-class variability.

Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor rates and patterns of urban expansion, but many early challenges - such as distinguishing new urban land from bare ground - remain unsolved. To deal with the high temporal and spatial variability as well as complex, multi-signature classes within settlements, this paper presents a new approach that exploits multi-seasonal information in dense time stacks of Landsat imagery using a multi-date composite change detection technique. The central premise of the approach is that lands within\/near urban areas have distinct temporal trajectories both before and after change occurs, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in several spectral regions. The method relies on a supervised classification that exploits training data of stable\/changed areas interpreted from Google Earth images, and a 'brute force' approach of providing all available Landsat data as input, including scenes with data gaps due to the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) problem. Three classification algorithms (maximum likelihood, boosted decision trees, and support vector machines) were tested for their ability to monitor expansion across five time periods (1988-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009) in three study areas that differ in size, eco-climatic conditions, and rates\/patterns of development. Both the decision trees and support vector machines outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier (overall accuracy of 90-93%, compared to 65%), but the decision trees were superior at handling missing data. Adding transformed features such as band metrics to the Landsat data stack increased accuracy 1-4%, while experiments with a reduced number of features (designed to mimic noisy or missing data) led to a drop in accuracy of 1-9%. The methodology also proved particularly effective for monitoring peri-urbanization outside the urban core, capturing > 98% of village settlements. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Author Keywords":"Change detection; Cities; Classification; Decision trees; Environment; Land cover; Machine learning; Peri-urban; Random forests; Support vector machines; Urban areas; Urbanization","Authors":"Schneider A.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.rse.2012.06.006","x":9.63,"y":-4.16,"KeyPhrases":["new urban land","multi-date composite change detection","Landsat data","classification algorithms","temporal and spatial variability"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"new urban land","score":0.4795581698},{"key-phrase":"multi-date composite change detection","score":0.4629772305},{"key-phrase":"Landsat imagery","score":0.4182057977},{"key-phrase":"Landsat data","score":0.410610348},{"key-phrase":"urban expansion","score":0.3993457258},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.3713081181},{"key-phrase":"supervised classification","score":0.3702099621},{"key-phrase":"classification algorithms","score":0.3631188273},{"key-phrase":"land transformation","score":0.352134645},{"key-phrase":"available Landsat data","score":0.3414975107},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.3372507989},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3333908916},{"key-phrase":"temporal and spatial variability","score":0.3173406124},{"key-phrase":"Google Earth image","score":0.2986407578},{"key-phrase":"multi-seasonal information","score":0.2980830669},{"key-phrase":"eco-climatic condition","score":0.2710075378},{"key-phrase":"maximum likelihood classifier","score":0.2589760423},{"key-phrase":"urban core","score":0.2493591011},{"key-phrase":"training data","score":0.2429796159},{"key-phrase":"near urban area","score":0.2427309602},{"key-phrase":"characteristic temporal signature","score":0.2385264039},{"key-phrase":"changed area","score":0.2318142503},{"key-phrase":"ecological process","score":0.2110273242},{"key-phrase":"distinct temporal trajectory","score":0.2091991901},{"key-phrase":"several spectral region","score":0.1931945086},{"key-phrase":"village settlement","score":0.1917372048},{"key-phrase":"data gap","score":0.1706388742},{"key-phrase":"bare ground","score":0.1363147199},{"key-phrase":"time period","score":0.1336668432},{"key-phrase":"dense time stack","score":0.1306287497},{"key-phrase":"missing data","score":0.1289967448},{"key-phrase":"multi-signature class","score":0.1132324934},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.1084787026},{"key-phrase":"many part","score":0.1061199456},{"key-phrase":"Line Corrector","score":0.0985039398},{"key-phrase":"powerful tool","score":0.0977940857},{"key-phrase":"daily quality","score":0.078357622},{"key-phrase":"maximum likelihood","score":0.0757197961},{"key-phrase":"new approach","score":0.0731103942},{"key-phrase":"many early challenge","score":0.070739612},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.0681501329},{"key-phrase":"stack","score":0.053760305},{"key-phrase":"important role","score":0.0379885621},{"key-phrase":"brute force","score":0.0328669325},{"key-phrase":"material flow","score":0.0148169622},{"key-phrase":"exploits","score":0.0081049157},{"key-phrase":"central premise","score":-0.0105329026},{"key-phrase":"life issue","score":-0.0237508975}]},{"Cluster":20,"Score":0.769230672,"DocId":579,"Cited by":6.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Review","Title":"Visual gaze analysis of robotic pedestrians moving in urban space","Abstract":"This study is founded on the idea that an analysis of the visual gaze dynamics of pedestrians can increase our understanding of how important architectural features in urban environments are perceived by pedestrians. The results of such an analysis can lead to improvements in urban design. However, a technical challenge arises when trying to determine the gaze direction of pedestrians recorded on video. High noise levels and the subtlety of human gaze dynamics hamper precise calculations. However, as robots can be programmed and analysed more efficiently than humans, this study uses them for developing and training a gaze analysis system with the aim to later apply it to human video data using the machine learning technique of manifold alignment. For this study, a laboratory was set up to become a model street scene in which autonomous humanoid robots of approximately 55cm in height simulate the behaviour of human pedestrians. The experiments compare the inputs from several cameras as the robot walks down the model street and changes its behaviour upon encountering visually attractive objects. Overhead recordings and the robot's internal joint signals are analysed after filtering to provide true data against which the recorded data can be compared for accuracy testing. A central component of the research is the calculation of a torus-like manifold that represents all the different three-dimensional (3D) head directions of a robot head and allows the ordering of extracted 3D gaze vectors obtained from video sequences. We briefly describe how the obtained multidimensional trajectory data can be analysed by using a temporal behaviour analysis technique based on support vector machines that was developed separately. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"gaze analysis; localization; manifold learning; pedestrians; robots; saliency; tracking","Authors":"Wong A.S.W., Chalup S.K., Bhatia S., Jalalian A., Kulk J., Nicklin S., Ostwald M.J.","DOI":"10.1080\/00038628.2012.688013","x":5.0900001526,"y":6.3699998856,"KeyPhrases":["gaze analysis system","multidimensional trajectory data","manifold alignment","autonomous humanoid robot","model street scene"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"gaze analysis system","score":0.6049166918},{"key-phrase":"3D gaze vector","score":0.5126135349},{"key-phrase":"human video data","score":0.506087184},{"key-phrase":"human gaze","score":0.5026634336},{"key-phrase":"visual gaze dynamic","score":0.4983495474},{"key-phrase":"gaze direction","score":0.4704806805},{"key-phrase":"support vector machine","score":0.4262354076},{"key-phrase":"manifold alignment","score":0.4164579809},{"key-phrase":"gaze","score":0.4048754573},{"key-phrase":"autonomous humanoid robot","score":0.3944125175},{"key-phrase":"robot head","score":0.387009263},{"key-phrase":"model street scene","score":0.3791617453},{"key-phrase":"head direction","score":0.364400804},{"key-phrase":"multidimensional trajectory data","score":0.3639367819},{"key-phrase":"robot","score":0.3390209973},{"key-phrase":"temporal behaviour analysis","score":0.3328538239},{"key-phrase":"human pedestrian","score":0.3167402148},{"key-phrase":"video sequence","score":0.2555160224},{"key-phrase":"urban design","score":0.2534205317},{"key-phrase":"model street","score":0.251093924},{"key-phrase":"like manifold","score":0.2500178814},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.2418364882},{"key-phrase":"several camera","score":0.2229873389},{"key-phrase":"attractive object","score":0.1923241168},{"key-phrase":"true data","score":0.1316981912},{"key-phrase":"internal joint signal","score":0.089803867},{"key-phrase":"important architectural feature","score":0.0838208869},{"key-phrase":"accuracy testing","score":0.0778982788},{"key-phrase":"technical challenge","score":0.0639859736},{"key-phrase":"central component","score":0.059293583},{"key-phrase":"Overhead recording","score":0.0495548509},{"key-phrase":"precise calculation","score":0.01640689},{"key-phrase":"High noise level","score":-0.0160253644}]},{"Cluster":29,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":580,"Cited by":3.0,"Year":2012,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Detecting players personality behavior with any effort of concealment","Abstract":"We introduce a novel natural language processing component using machine learning techniques for prediction of personality behaviors of players in a serious game, Land Science, where players act as interns in an urban planning firm and discuss in groups their ideas about urban planning and environmental science in written natural language.

To mitigate the effect of completeness errors in OSM, this study proposes a methodological framework for predicting by means of OSM urban areas in Europe that are currently not mapped or only partially mapped. For this purpose, a machine learning approach consisting of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms is applied. Under the premise of existing OSM data, the model estimates missing urban areas with an overall squared correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.589. Interregional comparisons of European regions confirm spatial heterogeneity in the model performance, whereas the R 2 ranges from 0.129 up to 0.789. These results show that the delineation of urban areas by means of the presented methodology depends strongly on location. \u00a9 2012 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"Machine learning; OpenStreetMap UK; Spatial data quality; Volunteered geographic information","Authors":"Hagenauer J., Helbich M.","DOI":"10.1080\/13658816.2011.619501","x":8.43,"y":-3.45,"KeyPhrases":["spatial data quality","genetic algorithms","urban area","completeness error","OSM"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"spatial data quality","score":0.4654796422},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.429754436},{"key-phrase":"genetic algorithms","score":0.3598437309},{"key-phrase":"spatial heterogeneity","score":0.3290616274},{"key-phrase":"machine learning approach","score":0.3273518085},{"key-phrase":"OSM data","score":0.3259305954},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.3226479292},{"key-phrase":"OSM","score":0.2816542089},{"key-phrase":"European region","score":0.2272236049},{"key-phrase":"Interregional comparison","score":0.2271871269},{"key-phrase":"mapped","score":0.225695923},{"key-phrase":"completeness error","score":0.1972454935},{"key-phrase":"particular completeness","score":0.1811707169},{"key-phrase":"model performance","score":0.1645278335},{"key-phrase":"overall squared correlation coefficient","score":0.1219375879},{"key-phrase":"specific application","score":0.1218265593},{"key-phrase":"methodological framework","score":0.0763415322},{"key-phrase":"essential aspect","score":0.0254315957}]},{"Cluster":30,"Score":0.2909963508,"DocId":583,"Cited by":4.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Comparison of machine learning techniques for the automatic recognition of soundscapes","Abstract":"Rather than recognising single environmental sound sources, research on soundscape recognition aims at identifying general unstructured auditory scenes composed of multiple simultaneous sound sources. Nowadays, soundscape recognition has multiple applications, such as: i) contextawareness for mobile robots and portable devices, so as to provide information about the surrounding acoustic environment, enabling the automatic reaction of the device without human intervention; ii) background noise identification for speech recognition systems, so as to improve the robustness of such systems by facilitating their adaptability to any indoor or outdoor environment; iii) support tool in urban planning and noise annoyance assessment. In this paper, pattern recognition techniques specially designed to automatically recognise soundscapes are implemented. Specifically, the study focuses on finding the most appropriated learning paradigm. A set of machine learning techniques, commonly employed in similar sound recognition tasks, are considered: decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian Mixture Models and Neural Networks. Extensive experiments are carried out so as to empirically test and compare the performance attained by the different learning techniques. The experiments are performed employing an audio data corpus composed of 15 different soundscenes, such as park, traffic street, restaurant or stadium.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Valero X., Farr\u00e9 P., Al\u00edas F.","DOI":null,"x":4.4499998093,"y":2.5799999237,"KeyPhrases":["soundscape recognition","decision tree","speech recognition system","urban planning","noise annoyance assessment"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"soundscape recognition","score":0.7901661992},{"key-phrase":"unstructured auditory scene","score":0.6015453935},{"key-phrase":"similar sound recognition","score":0.5436483622},{"key-phrase":"acoustic environment","score":0.5199135542},{"key-phrase":"background noise identification","score":0.5144396424},{"key-phrase":"noise annoyance assessment","score":0.4635949731},{"key-phrase":"audio data corpus","score":0.4618680477},{"key-phrase":"single environmental sound source","score":0.4607975185},{"key-phrase":"speech recognition system","score":0.4348341823},{"key-phrase":"different soundscenes","score":0.4304177165},{"key-phrase":"sound","score":0.3868847489},{"key-phrase":"pattern recognition technique","score":0.3807699084},{"key-phrase":"decision tree","score":0.3759016991},{"key-phrase":"multiple simultaneous sound source","score":0.3613609672},{"key-phrase":"machine learning technique","score":0.3611446917},{"key-phrase":"Gaussian Mixture Models","score":0.3373722434},{"key-phrase":"Neural Networks","score":0.3083616495},{"key-phrase":"mobile robot","score":0.3072188199},{"key-phrase":"different learning technique","score":0.2899776995},{"key-phrase":"outdoor environment","score":0.2759785056},{"key-phrase":"Neighbours algorithm","score":0.2695320249},{"key-phrase":"urban planning","score":0.2399484366},{"key-phrase":"recognition","score":0.2287098467},{"key-phrase":"learning paradigm","score":0.2123453021},{"key-phrase":"automatic reaction","score":0.2065152228},{"key-phrase":"traffic street","score":0.2031350732},{"key-phrase":"support tool","score":0.131024465},{"key-phrase":"multiple application","score":0.1218228936},{"key-phrase":"portable device","score":0.1142018512},{"key-phrase":"such system","score":0.0867410302},{"key-phrase":"Extensive experiment","score":0.0436741486},{"key-phrase":"human intervention","score":0.0396198705}]},{"Cluster":2,"Score":0.9407071621,"DocId":584,"Cited by":1.0,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Conference Paper","Title":"Urban computing and smart cities: Opportunities and challenges in modelling large-scale aggregated human behavior","Abstract":"City-wide urban infrastructures are increasingly reliant on networked technology to improve and expand their services.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Citizen science; Solitary bees; Spatial distribution; Sun exposure; Trap nest; Urban landscape structure","Authors":"Everaars J., Strohbach M.W., Gruber B., Dormann C.F.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2011.05.008","x":-5.7800002098,"y":6.7699999809,"KeyPhrases":["common wild bee","urban environment","nearby floral resource","suitable nesting opportunity","digital GIS biotope"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"common wild bee","score":0.5464006066},{"key-phrase":"urban habitat","score":0.4821172953},{"key-phrase":"solitary bee","score":0.4718465209},{"key-phrase":"bee","score":0.4688887},{"key-phrase":"wild bee","score":0.4613578916},{"key-phrase":"red mason bee","score":0.4423818588},{"key-phrase":"urban environment","score":0.4184957147},{"key-phrase":"nearby floral resource","score":0.398422718},{"key-phrase":"local flower availability","score":0.3974318504},{"key-phrase":"urban area","score":0.3943161964},{"key-phrase":"early-season pollination","score":0.3909917474},{"key-phrase":"trap nest","score":0.3819014728},{"key-phrase":"artificial nest","score":0.3781790137},{"key-phrase":"fine-scaled floral resource","score":0.36191383},{"key-phrase":"urban region","score":0.3473371267},{"key-phrase":"landscape structure","score":0.3231800199},{"key-phrase":"flower site","score":0.3005198836},{"key-phrase":"private garden","score":0.2971399426},{"key-phrase":"digital GIS biotope","score":0.2631240487},{"key-phrase":"urban matrix property","score":0.2448200732},{"key-phrase":"landscape factor","score":0.238695398},{"key-phrase":"spatial distribution","score":0.2353413105},{"key-phrase":"suitable nesting opportunity","score":0.2320900112},{"key-phrase":"open housing structure","score":0.2245480567},{"key-phrase":"good environment","score":0.2046095133},{"key-phrase":"citizen science approach","score":0.2000344694},{"key-phrase":"machine learning","score":0.1885615587},{"key-phrase":"data map","score":0.1547336131},{"key-phrase":"Osmia bicornis","score":0.1421934217},{"key-phrase":"different location","score":0.1354925334},{"key-phrase":"sun exposure","score":0.1334277838},{"key-phrase":"microsite condition","score":0.114456065},{"key-phrase":"bicornis","score":0.1117677093},{"key-phrase":"resource distribution","score":0.1106640548},{"key-phrase":"edge length","score":0.0598184988},{"key-phrase":"balanced influence","score":0.0234209523},{"key-phrase":"attachment position","score":0.0051149316}]},{"Cluster":23,"Score":0.8225176858,"DocId":586,"Cited by":null,"Year":2011,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"10th International Conference on Modeling and Applied Simulation, MAS 2011, Held at the International Mediterranean and Latin American Modeling Multiconference, I3M 2011","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 72 papers and 1 PowerPoint presentation.

informal settlement area using the open-source knowledge-based system InterIMAGE","Abstract":"This study uses the InterIMAGE system and imagery from the Quick Bird sensor for land cover and land use classification at two test sites with informal settlements in the metropolis of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. InterIMAGE is an open source and free access system for knowledge-based image classification. Within InterIMAGE human knowledge is represented as a semantic net and by user-defined rules based on the paradigms of object-oriented image analysis. In the land cover classification step, a genetic algorithm was used for determining appropriate segmentation parameters. For the description of the land cover classes in terms of features and thresholds, a strategy combining machine learning algorithms and a semantic net was elaborated. Based on the land cover classifications, the land use classifications were carried out considering the urban blocks of the test sites as the analysis units. Customized features related to the composition and geometrical structures of the land cover objects within these blocks were used for the description of the land use classes. The proposed methodology has been shown to be efficient for the automatic mapping of the land cover and land use in complex urban areas. The land cover classifications achieved overall accuracies above 70 percent and Kappa indexes above 0.65. Referring to the land use classifications, overall accuracies above 87 percent and Kappa indexes above 0.71 were obtained. This study has explored the main functionalities of the InterIMAGE system, presenting its potential for object-based and knowledge-based image classification. \u00a9 2010 Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute and Mapping Sciences Institute, Australia.","Author Keywords":"Informal settlements; InterIMAGE; Knowledge-based image classification; Urban land cover; Urban land use; Urban planning","Authors":"Novack T., Kux H.J.H.","DOI":"10.1080\/14498596.2010.487640","x":9.57,"y":-4.2,"KeyPhrases":["land use classification","Quick Bird sensor","semantic net","machine learning algorithm","S\u00e3o Paulo"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"land use classification","score":0.693154633},{"key-phrase":"land cover classification","score":0.6878734827},{"key-phrase":"land cover classes","score":0.5541767478},{"key-phrase":"land cover","score":0.5233135223},{"key-phrase":"land cover object","score":0.4976831973},{"key-phrase":"land use class","score":0.4936655164},{"key-phrase":"image classification","score":0.4651928246},{"key-phrase":"complex urban area","score":0.4263055623},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.4228761196},{"key-phrase":"semantic net","score":0.4204116464},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3696423471},{"key-phrase":"image analysis","score":0.3563278913},{"key-phrase":"automatic mapping","score":0.3383573294},{"key-phrase":"Quick Bird sensor","score":0.335332334},{"key-phrase":"appropriate segmentation parameter","score":0.2464681864},{"key-phrase":"genetic algorithm","score":0.2227163315},{"key-phrase":"human knowledge","score":0.2057759166},{"key-phrase":"geometrical structure","score":0.1791909486},{"key-phrase":"urban block","score":0.1750507355},{"key-phrase":"S\u00e3o Paulo","score":0.1455836892},{"key-phrase":"open source","score":0.1387630999},{"key-phrase":"free access system","score":0.1314251721},{"key-phrase":"overall accuracy","score":0.1307067424},{"key-phrase":"analysis unit","score":0.1231577694},{"key-phrase":"Kappa index","score":0.1168844253},{"key-phrase":"Customized feature","score":0.1038088202},{"key-phrase":"cover","score":0.097838223},{"key-phrase":"informal settlement","score":0.0963283777},{"key-phrase":"test site","score":0.0915739983},{"key-phrase":"main functionality","score":0.0893088132},{"key-phrase":"InterIMAGE system","score":0.0843496546},{"key-phrase":"interimage","score":0.0754449368},{"key-phrase":"test sites","score":0.0698959604}]},{"Cluster":15,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":589,"Cited by":51.0,"Year":2009,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Land-use-change modeling using unbalanced support-vector machines","Abstract":"Modeling land-use change is a prerequisite to understanding the complexity of land-use-change patterns. This paper presents a novel method to model urban land-use change using support-vector machines (SVMs), a new generation of machine learning algorithms used in classification and regression domains. An SVM modeling framework has been developed to analyze land-use change in relation to various factors such as population, distance to roads and facilities, and surrounding land use. As land-use data are generally unbalanced, in the sense that the unchanged data overwhelm the changed data, traditional methods are incapable of classifying relatively minor land-use changes with high accuracy. To circumvent this problem, an unbalanced SVM has been adopted by enhancing the standard SVMs. A case study of Calgary land-use change demonstrates that the unbalanced SVMs can achieve high and reliable performance for land-use-change modeling. \u00a9 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Huang B., Xie C., Tay R., Wu B.","DOI":"10.1068\/b33047","x":9.28,"y":-3.57,"KeyPhrases":["svms","land use","change modeling","unbalanced","novel method"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"svms","score":0.4692820311},{"key-phrase":"SVM modeling framework","score":0.4616037607},{"key-phrase":"land use","score":0.4418452382},{"key-phrase":"unbalanced SVMs","score":0.414061904},{"key-phrase":"urban land","score":0.4090467095},{"key-phrase":"standard SVMs","score":0.4050361216},{"key-phrase":"unbalanced SVM","score":0.392216146},{"key-phrase":"change modeling","score":0.3646659851},{"key-phrase":"machine learning algorithm","score":0.3575596213},{"key-phrase":"vector machine","score":0.3055651188},{"key-phrase":"regression domain","score":0.2502536774},{"key-phrase":"unchanged data","score":0.2397524118},{"key-phrase":"use change","score":0.2238577157},{"key-phrase":"minor land","score":0.2200755477},{"key-phrase":"change pattern","score":0.2079666257},{"key-phrase":"use data","score":0.1634172648},{"key-phrase":"Calgary land","score":0.14654015},{"key-phrase":"novel method","score":0.1290774047},{"key-phrase":"high accuracy","score":0.1103565693},{"key-phrase":"unbalanced","score":0.1052155122},{"key-phrase":"new generation","score":0.0902847797},{"key-phrase":"various factor","score":0.0878304914},{"key-phrase":"case study","score":0.0555615686},{"key-phrase":"traditional method","score":0.024472652},{"key-phrase":"high and reliable performance","score":-0.0310166702}]},{"Cluster":17,"Score":0.9816804547,"DocId":590,"Cited by":86.0,"Year":2008,"Document Type":"Article","Title":"Land-cover change and environmental impact analysis in the Greater Mankato area of Minnesota using remote sensing and GIS modelling","Abstract":"Land use and land-cover (LULC) data provide essential information for environmental management and planning. This research evaluates the land-cover change dynamics and their effects for the Greater Mankato Area of Minnesota using image classification and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) modelling in high-resolution aerial photography and QuickBird imagery. Results show that from 1971 to 2003, urban impervious surfaces increased from 18.3% to 32.6%, while cropland and grassland decreased from 54.2% to 39.1%. The dramatic urbanization caused evident environmental impacts in terms of runoff and water quality, whereas the annual air pollution removal rate and carbon storage\/sequestration remained consistent since urban forests were steady over the 32-year span. The results also indicate that highly accurate land-cover features can be extracted effectively from high-resolution imagery by incorporating both spectral and spatial information, applying an image-fusion technique, and utilizing the hierarchical machine-learning Feature Analyst classifier. This research fills the high-resolution LULC data gap for the Greater Mankato Area.

In this multi-disciplinary experiment, artificial intelligence (AI) and landscape architecture (LA) bridge their respective domains to measure and model the pedestrian reaction to walking environments in small town residential community in Central Texas. In the process, we gained a deeper understanding of the health motivation of walkers and their empirical relationship to various street environments that they used for health purposes. The analytical model we ultimately developed is a flexible tool that facilitates exploration of people's perceptions of the landscape, how the pedestrian landscapes are functioning in the opinion of its users, and how changes to the design of the walking domain may predictably affect physical activity levels with the associated health benefits. A pilot study involving fifty-four participants and six walking environments were used in the development of an analytical model that is significantly site-specific and grass roots oriented. Participant perceptions were measured querying each participant's rating of fifty discrete environmental variables taken. This data was then analyzed using the decision tree algorithm. Our primary objective was to capture the decision-making pattern walkers engage in when deciding to walk in a particular environment specifically for health purposes and to make this available to the designers of pedestrian environments in transportation corridors. The approach gave the designers new insight into the critical variables and the not so critical variables that affected people's decision to walk for health purposes. The results from the analysis defined measurable environmental variables that form the design for pedestrian activity in the six walking environments in the study area. A customized version of decision tree machine learning algorithm rules for designing good pedestrian landscapes for health purposes were extracted from the grass roots surveys. The data indicated that variables influencing the decision to walk for health purposes in the study area included weather, sound, water, light and edge of space. The analytical model derived from the discipline of artificial intelligence facilitated examining a subset of variables and manipulating of individual or group of these variables to better understand how the built environment affected decisions to walk for different purposes. This collaboration was our first phase in developing intelligent tools for designers that provided site-specific user-specific data to the planner or designer of pedestrian space.","Author Keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Multi-disciplinary design analysis, Walking for health; Pedestrian landscapes; User evaluation","Authors":"Naderi J.R., Raman B.","DOI":"10.1016\/j.landurbplan.2004.11.012","x":7.01,"y":-4.3,"KeyPhrases":["pedestrian environment","decision tree algorithm","health motivation","residential land use","empirical relationship"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"pedestrian environment","score":0.5806275606},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian landscape","score":0.5746120214},{"key-phrase":"good pedestrian landscape","score":0.5386173129},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian space","score":0.5079445243},{"key-phrase":"various street environment","score":0.4620826244},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian activity","score":0.449917078},{"key-phrase":"landscape architecture","score":0.430334866},{"key-phrase":"residential land use","score":0.4082945883},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian reaction","score":0.359205693},{"key-phrase":"decision tree algorithm","score":0.34555161},{"key-phrase":"decision tree machine","score":0.3264580965},{"key-phrase":"pedestrian","score":0.3226123452},{"key-phrase":"grass root survey","score":0.2883211076},{"key-phrase":"artificial intelligence","score":0.2864558995},{"key-phrase":"residential community","score":0.2845145464},{"key-phrase":"physical activity level","score":0.2738117576},{"key-phrase":"people's perception","score":0.2737902105},{"key-phrase":"health","score":0.2649129033},{"key-phrase":"discrete environmental variable","score":0.2604435682},{"key-phrase":"public health","score":0.258520484},{"key-phrase":"pattern walker","score":0.248475194},{"key-phrase":"Participant perception","score":0.2476670146},{"key-phrase":"transportation corridor","score":0.2422406822},{"key-phrase":"health purpose","score":0.2352515161},{"key-phrase":"health motivation","score":0.2241244316},{"key-phrase":"study area","score":0.2141762674},{"key-phrase":"associated health benefit","score":0.210027203},{"key-phrase":"intelligent tool","score":0.2076547891},{"key-phrase":"measurable environmental variable","score":0.205000177},{"key-phrase":"learning algorithm rule","score":0.2044127136},{"key-phrase":"participant's rating","score":0.2032479346},{"key-phrase":"people's decision","score":0.20291318},{"key-phrase":"health care","score":0.2021538913},{"key-phrase":"particular environment","score":0.1786366105},{"key-phrase":"Medicare health insurance","score":0.1723215133},{"key-phrase":"grass root","score":0.1614617109},{"key-phrase":"pilot study","score":0.1360903382},{"key-phrase":"empirical relationship","score":0.1307872236},{"key-phrase":"analytical model","score":0.1303436756},{"key-phrase":"multi-disciplinary experiment","score":0.118978247},{"key-phrase":"different purpose","score":0.1096850485},{"key-phrase":"primary objective","score":0.1076718941},{"key-phrase":"small town","score":0.1031487957},{"key-phrase":"specific data","score":0.0915179923},{"key-phrase":"critical variable","score":0.0790768415},{"key-phrase":"Central Texas","score":0.06706734},{"key-phrase":"specific user","score":0.0543691553},{"key-phrase":"new insight","score":0.0351900049},{"key-phrase":"respective domain","score":0.0326010585},{"key-phrase":"flexible tool","score":0.0246875715},{"key-phrase":"first phase","score":0.0205302257}]},{"Cluster":25,"Score":0.8030040393,"DocId":596,"Cited by":null,"Year":2004,"Document Type":"Conference Review","Title":"15th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications, DEXA 2004","Abstract":"The proceedings contain 92 papers.

These approaches are increasingly being applied to traffic and transportation problems formerly reserved for formal statistical approaches such as discrete choice models. Part of the reason for this has to do with research trends, but there are some potential advantages associated with such techniques, including the ability to model nonlinear systems; the ease with which symbolic, nominal, or categorical variables can be included; and the ability of these methods to deal with noisy data. The use of two modeling techniques, the nested logit model and the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, was investigated in terms of their applicability to the household vehicle choice problem. Both methods generated strong results, although the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network yielded better predictive potential.","Author Keywords":null,"Authors":"Mohammadian A., Miller E.J.","DOI":"10.3141\/1807-12","x":12.6700000763,"y":1.8099999428,"KeyPhrases":["household vehicle choice","artificial neural network","logit model","transportation problem","research trend"],"CandidatePhrases":[{"key-phrase":"household vehicle choice","score":0.5098034739},{"key-phrase":"artificial neural network","score":0.4530197382},{"key-phrase":"transportation problem","score":0.4475185871},{"key-phrase":"multilayer perceptron","score":0.3972898126},{"key-phrase":"logit model","score":0.3928409517},{"key-phrase":"discrete choice model","score":0.3470224142},{"key-phrase":"perceptron","score":0.3324549198},{"key-phrase":"modeling technique","score":0.3087670803},{"key-phrase":"categorical variable","score":0.2863390744},{"key-phrase":"predictive potential","score":0.2538057566},{"key-phrase":"nonlinear system","score":0.2384380251},{"key-phrase":"formal statistical approach","score":0.2050591409},{"key-phrase":"noisy data","score":0.2044616938},{"key-phrase":"multilayer","score":0.153660506},{"key-phrase":"research trend","score":0.1219901145},{"key-phrase":"potential advantage","score":0.1128293872},{"key-phrase":"strong result","score":0.0304253772},{"key-phrase":"such technique","score":0.0208347961},{"key-phrase":"past few year","score":0.0188006703}]}]
